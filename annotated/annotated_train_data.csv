65,118054," I suspect you mean subjective when you write arbitrary. Any criteria is subjective.

56,80299," That is fine.   This doesn't hold true to current laws at the moment even disregarding this topic but ok. I'll keep it in mind.   Yep.   Hmm. This seems to ignore realistic thingd but ok.  Just for an example if two rights to life conflict then it becomes a complex issue as they can't both survive.   But in some situations you forfeit rights (or possibly it isn't a factor). Like in the above example.     This is irrelevant at this point as the first thing was only to say it is something you can guarantee against besides abstinence. Which was the only point. As some say you can.     True and also irrelevant. As of now it is not safe. Hopefully it will be in the future. But that is not guaranteed and not the case currently.  Note there are plenty of dangers besides death.  This would be like saying it is ok to push someone off a cliff that has a 50% survival rate since it'll be 100% safe in the future.     You acknowledged the issue at the end. Most of this is comparable to the requirement that parents must care for their child and neglect is punishable. But the difference is that when talking about pregnancy it isn't purchasing or sharing food. It is giving another access to yourself for an indeterminate amount of time. And without seeing the future it can have life threatening complications.  This would be like the stowaway having a right to cut off and eat body parts of yours should you not have enough food to share.     Being human isn't what matters. Should we eventually evolve or develop into significantly different species those people wouldn't lose rights.  Being alive is not the important part as we question the potential of AI beings being rights and they may not be considered alive if they can't satisfy the criteria. A vegetative human is still technically alive but they lose their rights.  While we could discuss both neurologically and philosophically the points you made fundamentally the reason why people have rights isn't because of an arbitrary generic structure or our classifications of life. It is because it the many things we are capable of. Thinking. Feeling. Ect.  So no it isn't just being human and alive. At least I don't think so. If you do why is human a really important thing.     I'll agree we don't have any guarantees. But that is all the more reason why you shouldn't force a person to maybe the choice to carry to term unless they are willing to do all they can do to care for the born individual.  The developing embryo has no thoughts or cares. Just like all the other embryos that get naturally miscarried, and gamete. These all didn't develope to the stage of thought. Which is what the minimal would be and why we consider human life valuable  Killing something isn't immoral. We can talk about self defense. We can talk about eating. In this case. An embryo of a human was killed (neglected is a bit more accurate but kill is sufficient). This embryo doesn't have a person's value added just because to gamete met. The value arises from something more than that. Human cells aren't important as our skin cells peel off daily and nobody sheds a tear. Those cells were living as well. Even individual brain cells aren't of value of the person.  By your last bit. The best time to have a child should be all the time. Every time a woman ovulate or a man ejaculated all those combination of kids are gone.   I'm not seeing it yet. You are right that our laws are also to protect the helpless. But they protect people for the reasons we value people. We don't protect biologically human and alive things that don't have the important aspects of why we give people rights.  I'll only note that convenience is mainly a factor in what laws can be made. I could make a law protecting the feelings of everyone but it is implausible to carry out so a law like that won't be made.

85,156200," My reason for not allowing late term abortions is that when the fetus becomes viable, the woman now has a *new* option to back out of a pregnancy, which is to just give birth. The definition of fetus viability means that the fetus can survive outside the mother, so there’s no reason to abort. The fetus doesn’t have to use the mother’s body so she can cut off access to her body and her organs. Before viability, the the only option that women have to back out of a pregnancy is to abort. So bodily autonomy is respected in all cases. Also, remember that I said that abortion is healthcare (based on the definition of healthcare which doesn’t include whether it’s legal or not), and when the fetus becomes viable, women now have a new option to get healthcare without aborting.   If you hold that view, you have to show consistency in your view. Otherwise, what’s stopping people from conveniently applying their morals when they want to? Morals are subjective but *moral consistency* is important. In the car accident scenario, you took an action that had a risk of hurting someone else and yourself and that risk ended up occurring, but you still deserve healthcare and the government still can’t force you to donate organs or body parts in that case even if the other person would die. The pregnancy situation is *directly* analogous so the same rules should apply. If you don’t agree, then you need to present an objective argument why, not just say it’s because it’s what you personally believe. Because then I can easily just counter that I disagree because it’s my personal belief and we would never get anywhere.     When you give someone any power, there will always be someone who misuses it. Always. This doesn’t apply to just abortions. Most people use knives to cut vegetables and meat, but some psychos use it to kill innocent people. Most people use cars responsibly to get to places, but some people drive drunk or irresponsibly and end people’s lives. Most people use controlled medication responsibly, but some people will abuse those medications or give it to other people irresponsibly. The truth is that anytime you give people something, someone will misuse it, but that doesn’t mean most people will. Abortion is a difficult decision for a lot of women. I’ve heard so many pro-choice women saying that they personally would never get an abortion but they can’t choose for other people. I’ve heard of so many women who were literally pressured to get an abortion but still chose to keep the baby. Will some women misuse abortion and treat it like some sort of birth control? Sure, but you can’t take away something from a majority of people just because a small group of people would misuse it. Because then you would have to take away cars, planes, knives, controlled medication, hammers, guns, etc. Anything that someone could use to harm another person. Again, this is to maintain moral consistency.   Also, I just want to reiterate that bodily autonomy is important not because I say so or that it’s what I personally value. Like I said in my previous comment, you have to draw boundary on ownership when it comes to enforcing your morals. I can’t tell you what to do with what you own and you can’t do that to me. If we started doing that, no one would get anywhere, because as soon as you force someone to do something, they can force you to do something to cancel it out. The government also has to respect ownership. The reason that parents have to use their resources on kids is because they voluntarily consented to it in order to have parental rights. The reason that the government can take our tax money is that we consent to it by using federal services like roads, police, the justice system, etc. There’s a lot of things people do that I don’t think they should but I can’t control because I have no rights over them. I can’t force rich people to donate money to the poor because it’s not my money. I can’t force people not to say mean things to other people because it’s their voice and they have freedom of speech. So you’re right that people do a lot of things that other people would think they shouldn’t, but that doesn’t mean they can force them to stop.",0,0_abortion_abortions_fetus_pregnancy,against

167,89260," But how having people being able to change their minds make a thing unethical?    You made a lot of assumptions tho. First you assumed that the trial will take such long time (the woman may say to want an abortion, clinician propose to her such experiment and then the test is conducted in the same week of her consent exactly to not prolong pregnancy for too long)    The other scenario was to kill it. Are these health issues worse than death? She can still kill it if such health complications are worse than death (making unethical to let the child live), while she can keep it alive atleast if death is worse than some health issue (making abortion more unethical than a clinical experiment). But this is besides the point.  Having the ability to change their mind and then dealing with the consequences of their decisions may not be enough to justify the ban of something. If this was the argument, then abortion also shouldn't be allowed, because similar things can happen with abortion (see the example of a fetus that was supposedly was not viable, but now survive and have its life marked by such event, or the case of a women that didn't know that her baby was sentient at that stage and for this reason decide to take to court her doctors because she it would have rethought about abortion in that case; examples  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8281321/Landmark-legal-bid-force-clinics-tell-women-truth-involved-abortion.html  And https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/MindMoodNews/michigan-woman-claims-doctor-forced-abortion-stop/story%3fid=10809114 -here the doctor may have been forced to terminate the pregnancy due to circumstances; too late for rethinking about it -)    Wait what? Who talked aboug a woman and arrest her? The whole point that we allow this experiment is exactly because we enable complete bodily autonomy to the woman (here the link with abortion) and to give the woman such option that would also benefit a lot of people. If the fetus is mess up by this or have an unhappy life because of the mother decision during pregnancy suck for him (like some other pro-choicer argued here). The will of the mother is above anything, even in circumstances of bad decision making. Its a Zef, not a person. If you donate an organ, such as a kidney, and then you want it back...it is too late to reverse the decision. It doesn't mean that we should do organ transplants and donations just because some situations like this may happen.    Good but the consequences are dictated by your consent not other, you can revoke your consent but if you did something, you did something and you should accept the consequences of that thing.   I can ask you some water and the say i don't want it anymore, but if you put a bit of water on my glass is not your fault.    Previous point. You just accept the consequences of your decisions. Other pro-choice (so far i counted 2) here argue that in both genetic engineering and such situation, if the son or daughter sue the mother for a genetic editing she/he didn't want to or a permanent damage as a result of the mother decision during pregnancy, the mother should have total legal immunity from such accusations as her will is more important. Essentially suck for them (at least some people here have argued)    It is possible for her to change her mind, it is impossible to avoid the consequence of her decision. That was my point. This under your view does not make inheretly abortion unethical. In the previous case, your applied a logic based on the potenial individual that the fetus could have be (i.e. an healthy one). If you really think about it this may be similar in some aspects to the prospective of pro-lifers since they see abortion unethical due to the potential individual that the fetus could have been.   It really depends if you think that death is worse than having some health issues or the contrary (or equal in gravity). In any case you will not came out from it clean. If keeping a fetus with health issues is worse than death, then a woman that decide to keep alive a baby with such health issues instead of kill it is committing a very unethical decision that is worse than doing an abortion. If death is worse than having some health issues, then abortion should be wrong.   That's why i argued that the debate is much more complex than many people think (people just say pro-life or pro-choice without thinking too much to the ethical implications of their opinions in a more greater picture)",0,0_abortion_abortions_fetus_pregnancy,for
