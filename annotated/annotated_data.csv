You say that murder is the “unlawful taking of a life”. You’re under the impression that in the PCer’s argument - the factor that changes between an abortion and fetal homicide is the “life” part. But that’s not what changes in our arguments. It’s the “unlawful” part.   It’s not that the fetus isn’t considered to be a life in any of my arguments against government abortion bans. My arguments *grant* that it is life. My arguments are that it is/should be *lawful* taking of a life.   There are other situations where I grant that the person being killed is alive - but that I think should be considered *lawful* taking of a life. Killing in self-defense would be one such example.   So I’m not and never have tried to argue that the fetus isn’t a life. I just believe that abortion is a justified/lawful taking of a life, where as beating someone else to the point that they miscarry is not. Both involve the fetus (which was a human life) dying. But I believe one is justified on the grounds of bodily integrity, and the other is not.

I know people that would deeply argue the contrary like many advocates for autistic people that are against procedure that basically lead them to not exist (see the controversy around Mark Rober around color the spectrum). Many would have the same opinion if such technology will be used to lower the probability of the onset of Gay and Trans people (or even straight people for that matter).

So i guess you are pro-choice mostly until viability then (since we know that abortion after some weeks will cause fetus suffering; with ""until viability"" i imply if there are no serious medical conditions - both from mother or fetus - thus your view would at that point also align with the majority of the scientific community).   A thing is if it was inherited, a different thing instead is if she willingly did something to affect you in a negative way (like some pro-choice here argued; if you read many comments there are a lot of people that would be against the mother if she is willingly causing harm to the fetus). If a doctor do something wrong to the fetus and you develop an abnormality because of him, there can be legal grounds for took him to court. But again, if you think that the mother bodily autonomy is above everything, your argument then is still consistent, so this one is more an observation rather than criticism.

Just for an example if two rights to life conflict then it becomes a complex issue as they can't both survive.   But in some situations you forfeit rights (or possibly it isn't a factor). Like in the above example.     This is irrelevant at this point as the first thing was only to say it is something you can guarantee against besides abstinence. Which was the only point. As some say you can.     True and also irrelevant. As of now it is not safe. Hopefully it will be in the future. But that is not guaranteed and not the case currently.  Note there are plenty of dangers besides death.  This would be like saying it is ok to push someone off a cliff that has a 50% survival rate since it'll be 100% safe in the future.     You acknowledged the issue at the end. Most of this is comparable to the requirement that parents must care for their child and neglect is punishable. But the difference is that when talking about pregnancy it isn't purchasing or sharing food. It is giving another access to yourself for an indeterminate amount of time. And without seeing the future it can have life threatening complications.  This would be like the stowaway having a right to cut off and eat body parts of yours should you not have enough food to share.     Being human isn't what matters. Should we eventually evolve or develop into significantly different species those people wouldn't lose rights.  Being alive is not the important part as we question the potential of AI beings being rights and they may not be considered alive if they can't satisfy the criteria. A vegetative human is still technically alive but they lose their rights.  While we could discuss both neurologically and philosophically the points you made fundamentally the reason why people have rights isn't because of an arbitrary generic structure or our classifications of life. It is because it the many things we are capable of. Thinking. Feeling. Ect.  So no it isn't just being human and alive. At least I don't think so. If you do why is human a really important thing.     I'll agree we don't have any guarantees. But that is all the more reason why you shouldn't force a person to maybe the choice to carry to term unless they are willing to do all they can do to care for the born individual.  The developing embryo has no thoughts or cares. Just like all the other embryos that get naturally miscarried, and gamete. These all didn't develope to the stage of thought. Which is what the minimal would be and why we consider human life valuable  Killing something isn't immoral. We can talk about self defense. We can talk about eating. In this case. An embryo of a human was killed (neglected is a bit more accurate but kill is sufficient). This embryo doesn't have a person's value added just because to gamete met. The value arises from something more than that. Human cells aren't important as our skin cells peel off daily and nobody sheds a tear. Those cells were living as well. Even individual brain cells aren't of value of the person.  By your last bit. The best time to have a child should be all the time. Every time a woman ovulate or a man ejaculated all those combination of kids are gone.   I'm not seeing it yet. You are right that our laws are also to protect the helpless. But they protect people for the reasons we value people. We don't protect biologically human and alive things that don't have the important aspects of why we give people rights.  I'll only note that convenience is mainly a factor in what laws can be made.

84374," The issue is not pleasant, but it is actually pretty simple to understand.  If the right to life is equal between two people we move to different criteria.  The importance here is that the right to life of every person in the situation has at least been considered.  This only happens when there is a serious threat to life and is the essence of why we allow for life threat exceptions.  It is a consistent part of the pro-life ethic to allow these as both mother and child have the right to life.  It only in that instance does the mother's life become also in danger, as opposed to only that of the child.   Only for choices you have made, and I would argue that in the case of the most basic human rights, you never forfeit them.    Of course, I don't agree with the death penalty either, so it is easy for me to be consistent there.     Here you make the common pro-choice mistake of ignoring the child in the situation, which we are not going to do.  Yes, pregnancy is not 100% safe, but abortion, is 100% fatal to the child.  You are arguing that we should accept a 100% fatality rate for one person to offset a less than 1% fatality rate for someone else.  That just doesn't make any logical sense.   Question all you like, but the AI issue is not pertinent here.  For one thing, there is no such thing as AI yet.  So, it makes little sense to discuss how rights would work with them at this juncture except in the broadest of outlines.  Second, AI would presumably be alive in some fashion.  Any particular AI would need to have a physical existence which it ran on just like any other lifeform or computer.  In that sense, it will have the same physical reality as a human and its own development.  Thirdly, human rights and AI rights are two different things.  Human rights are based on human context.  An AI almost certainly will not have an entirely human context.  Consequently, the sort of rights an AI will find important may be very different from those which humans have.  That is why species is important.  A human has human rights because it is a human organism.  We share a context that is human which is informed by our physical structure and how that interacts with the world.  That is why we can make rules which apply to other humans.    An AI will not be human, by definition.  How that causes an AI to see the world will be different than us.  We can negotiate an understanding between us and AI, but we will always have different needs, and consequently, different views of life.  Just making the argument that we might have ""consciousness"" is not a good basis for rights.  You must holistically understand the context of the organism you are dealing with.     Humanity isn't ""important"" in the sense that we are special.  Humanity is important in that it is how we relate to one another and our environment.  Human rights is the rules we make for ourselves when dealing with ourselves.  And we have the right to do that because we are only putting those obligations on ourselves for things that affect us.  Too many people take the wrong-headed position that it has something to do with humans being special.  That's completely the wrong takeaway.  I don't have to be superior to a dog or an AI to recognize that human organisms have particular needs that dogs or AIs might not have.  Our species, our rules.  There is nothing more to it than that.   I entirely disagree.  I am not requiring that the child be carried to term.  I am not even interested in whether the child lives or dies.  What I am interested in is that you do not kill them.  They don't have a right to be kept alive at all costs, but they do have a right to not be killed.  And I am resolute in the position that you don't have a crystal ball.  You can't tell me that every child ever aborted was always going to have bad life.  Plenty of people survive abuse and shitty parents and turn out to have good, productive and happy lives.    More to the point, I am annoyed that excuse is given for an action that is almost always taken for the sole benefit of the person making it.  How the life goes for the child is just a way of trying to justify to themselves something they were going to do anyway, and pretend that it was all for the best.  It's not all for the best.     Value is irrelevant.  Humans don't have to earn human rights.  Even a ""valueless"" human is entitled to human rights.  Human rights is based on membership, not some sort of earned value.  It is alien to the idea of human rights that you have to demonstrate value to get them.     That makes no sense, though.  You know full well that we make laws all the time which cannot be completely carried out.  Have murder laws ended murder?  Have theft laws ended theft?  Of course not.  We make laws based on the rights of other humans, even if those laws cannot always be completely enforced.  And consider this.  Murder laws don't catch every murderer, but they do catch many.  Abortion bans also won't stop every abortion, but they have and will continue to stop many.  You cannot pretend that we only make convenient to enforce laws.  When it comes to the big issues, most of our laws are very inconvenient to enforce, but we still do it.",0,0_abortion_abortions_fetus_pregnancy,against

156200," My reason for not allowing late term abortions is that when the fetus becomes viable, the woman now has a *new* option to back out of a pregnancy, which is to just give birth. The definition of fetus viability means that the fetus can survive outside the mother, so there’s no reason to abort. The fetus doesn’t have to use the mother’s body so she can cut off access to her body and her organs. Before viability, the the only option that women have to back out of a pregnancy is to abort. So bodily autonomy is respected in all cases. Also, remember that I said that abortion is healthcare (based on the definition of healthcare which doesn’t include whether it’s legal or not), and when the fetus becomes viable, women now have a new option to get healthcare without aborting.   If you hold that view, you have to show consistency in your view. Otherwise, what’s stopping people from conveniently applying their morals when they want to? Morals are subjective but *moral consistency* is important. In the car accident scenario, you took an action that had a risk of hurting someone else and yourself and that risk ended up occurring, but you still deserve healthcare and the government still can’t force you to donate organs or body parts in that case even if the other person would die. The pregnancy situation is *directly* analogous so the same rules should apply. If you don’t agree, then you need to present an objective argument why, not just say it’s because it’s what you personally believe. Because then I can easily just counter that I disagree because it’s my personal belief and we would never get anywhere.     When you give someone any power, there will always be someone who misuses it. Always. This doesn’t apply to just abortions. Most people use knives to cut vegetables and meat, but some psychos use it to kill innocent people. Most people use cars responsibly to get to places, but some people drive drunk or irresponsibly and end people’s lives. Most people use controlled medication responsibly, but some people will abuse those medications or give it to other people irresponsibly. The truth is that anytime you give people something, someone will misuse it, but that doesn’t mean most people will. Abortion is a difficult decision for a lot of women. I’ve heard so many pro-choice women saying that they personally would never get an abortion but they can’t choose for other people. I’ve heard of so many women who were literally pressured to get an abortion but still chose to keep the baby. Will some women misuse abortion and treat it like some sort of birth control? Sure, but you can’t take away something from a majority of people just because a small group of people would misuse it. Because then you would have to take away cars, planes, knives, controlled medication, hammers, guns, etc. Anything that someone could use to harm another person. Again, this is to maintain moral consistency.   Also, I just want to reiterate that bodily autonomy is important not because I say so or that it’s what I personally value. Like I said in my previous comment, you have to draw boundary on ownership when it comes to enforcing your morals. I can’t tell you what to do with what you own and you can’t do that to me. If we started doing that, no one would get anywhere, because as soon as you force someone to do something, they can force you to do something to cancel it out. The government also has to respect ownership. The reason that parents have to use their resources on kids is because they voluntarily consented to it in order to have parental rights. The reason that the government can take our tax money is that we consent to it by using federal services like roads, police, the justice system, etc. There’s a lot of things people do that I don’t think they should but I can’t control because I have no rights over them. I can’t force rich people to donate money to the poor because it’s not my money. I can’t force people not to say mean things to other people because it’s their voice and they have freedom of speech.

Everyone's life will eventually end.    As for posing a risk to someone else.  I'd point out again that it's a little silly to consider conceiving a child to be the same as putting them at risk.  Putting someone at risk is when you take an action which will impact a life which could have taken a different, better path.  If the only path for that life was early death, I don't see how you can argue that someone did something to risk them with that outcome.

Texans didn't lose abortion rights under Ann Richards, and Americans didn't lose abortion rights when there was a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, either. I'm sorry you're confused, but it was ~~conservatives~~ reactionaries who did both of those things. All you're doing is shifting blame from Republicans, where it belongs, onto Democrats. It's called [Murc's Law](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=murc%27s%20law).   Codification isn't the answer people think it is. A Supreme Court that can overturn a half-century-old precedent can just as easily find a statute unconstitutional. It's what they did in *Shelby County*, it's what they did in *Brnovich*, and it's what they did in *Bruen*.  Americans didn't lose abortion rights because of anything Biden or Democrats did or didn't do. Democrats didn't legislate away anyone's abortion rights. Americans lost their abortion rights because RBG failed to timely retire, and because American voters failed in nearly a decade of elections, which allowed Republicans to take away abortion rights.  If they'd elected a Democratic Senate majority in 2014, which would've let Obama fill Scalia's seat, there would be no Gorsuch. That would've given us a 5-4 liberal majority. They failed again in 2016, electing Trump and a GOP Senate majority instead of Clinton and Democratic majorities, giving us Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. That gave us a 5-4 reactionary majority. Then they failed again in 2018, giving us Barrett, and a 6-3 reactionary majority. Then they did the absolute bare minimum in 2020, electing a razor-thin Democratic margin in the House, and a literal zero-seat margin in the Senate.  There was no reason to codify abortion rights prior to 2017, because any bill that could actually have passed would've offered weaker protections than Roe already provided. It would've been legislating *away* abortion rights! But, to the extent you think it would've been worthwhile (you're wrong), the last chance they had to do so was during the 111th Congress, the first half of Obama's first term. Was there any movement to codify abortion rights back then? No. For the 112th-116th Congresses, it was impossible, because voters made it impossible. And in the 117th Congress, it was theoretically possible, except, as you already pointed out, they don't have the votes to either overcome or abolish the filibuster. Because, again, voters did the bare minimum in 2020. So you claim they could've done it, but then admit they actually couldn't. And, again, it wouldn't actually do what you want it to do in the first place, even if they did have the votes for it. Which they don't.  Losing abortion rights was a forgone conclusion after 2016. It's just that it took another six years to find a case and for that case to work its way to to the Supreme Court. You don't protect abortion rights by sometimes electing Democrats and sometimes electing Republicans, and hoping Democrats can do enough while they're in power to prevent Republicans from undoing it when they're in power. That's not how it works! You protect abortion rights by electing Democrats, at every level of government, in every single election, so Republicans never have an opportunity to take those rights away in the first place. If we'd elected Democratic majorities in 2014, 2016, and 2018, and elected Clinton over Trump, Dobb wouldn't have even been heard in the Supreme Court, and *Roe* and *Casey* would still be good law.   It's called choosing your battles. There is a finite amount of time and resources, and there's an opportunity cost to pursuing a bill that's doomed to fail, in that it means those resources can't be used to pursue another bill that could actually pass instead.

From what I've read (especially the many terrible recent situations), tightly regulating abortion, even after a certain number of weeks can potentially backfire against people that have desperate medical needs. I can't say I blame the doctors really, if their hands pretty much become tied and they have to either recieve approval from the hospital board before they can intervene and save the patient, time might be running out for said patient. Same if doctors are put into a situation of uncertainty, that previously hasn't existed (not just doctors, if someone in any job should suddenly fear that their normal actions might land them in prison, or loose ther license, or other such potential consequences), they will now have way more considerations to make aside from just that patient.

89260," But how having people being able to change their minds make a thing unethical?    You made a lot of assumptions tho. First you assumed that the trial will take such long time (the woman may say to want an abortion, clinician propose to her such experiment and then the test is conducted in the same week of her consent exactly to not prolong pregnancy for too long)    The other scenario was to kill it. Are these health issues worse than death? She can still kill it if such health complications are worse than death (making unethical to let the child live), while she can keep it alive atleast if death is worse than some health issue (making abortion more unethical than a clinical experiment). But this is besides the point.  Having the ability to change their mind and then dealing with the consequences of their decisions may not be enough to justify the ban of something. If this was the argument, then abortion also shouldn't be allowed, because similar things can happen with abortion (see the example of a fetus that was supposedly was not viable, but now survive and have its life marked by such event, or the case of a women that didn't know that her baby was sentient at that stage and for this reason decide to take to court her doctors because she it would have rethought about abortion in that case; examples  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8281321/Landmark-legal-bid-force-clinics-tell-women-truth-involved-abortion.html  And https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/MindMoodNews/michigan-woman-claims-doctor-forced-abortion-stop/story%3fid=10809114 -here the doctor may have been forced to terminate the pregnancy due to circumstances; too late for rethinking about it -)    Wait what? Who talked aboug a woman and arrest her? The whole point that we allow this experiment is exactly because we enable complete bodily autonomy to the woman (here the link with abortion) and to give the woman such option that would also benefit a lot of people. If the fetus is mess up by this or have an unhappy life because of the mother decision during pregnancy suck for him (like some other pro-choicer argued here). The will of the mother is above anything, even in circumstances of bad decision making. Its a Zef, not a person. If you donate an organ, such as a kidney, and then you want it back...it is too late to reverse the decision. It doesn't mean that we should do organ transplants and donations just because some situations like this may happen.    Good but the consequences are dictated by your consent not other, you can revoke your consent but if you did something, you did something and you should accept the consequences of that thing.   I can ask you some water and the say i don't want it anymore, but if you put a bit of water on my glass is not your fault.    Previous point. You just accept the consequences of your decisions. Other pro-choice (so far i counted 2) here argue that in both genetic engineering and such situation, if the son or daughter sue the mother for a genetic editing she/he didn't want to or a permanent damage as a result of the mother decision during pregnancy, the mother should have total legal immunity from such accusations as her will is more important. Essentially suck for them (at least some people here have argued)    It is possible for her to change her mind, it is impossible to avoid the consequence of her decision. That was my point. This under your view does not make inheretly abortion unethical. In the previous case, your applied a logic based on the potenial individual that the fetus could have be (i.e. an healthy one). If you really think about it this may be similar in some aspects to the prospective of pro-lifers since they see abortion unethical due to the potential individual that the fetus could have been.   It really depends if you think that death is worse than having some health issues or the contrary (or equal in gravity). In any case you will not came out from it clean. If keeping a fetus with health issues is worse than death, then a woman that decide to keep alive a baby with such health issues instead of kill it is committing a very unethical decision that is worse than doing an abortion. If death is worse than having some health issues, then abortion should be wrong.

If a doctor has to pop your arm back in place after an accident there’s really no downside to that. With an abortion you’re aborting a whole child",0,0_abortion_abortions_fetus_pregnancy,against

75352," In a case where it's not the goal, such as cancer where chemo-therapy  is required before birth or the mother will die, then it could be an unfortunate side-effect.  That is a different case, depending on specifics.     But it shouldn't be able to be used as a loop-hole trojan horse to allow abortion on demand to hide inside where anyone can simply claim they have a medical concern and be allowed to abort.  Around 88% of abortions have no medical or pregnancy basis whatsoever, according to their own word.  They simply do not want or cannot afford a child.         Also, we have no idea how many voluntary abortions are chosen each year by pregnant patients who almost died carrying their last child and don't want to risk another pregnancy, or who have a family history of pregnancy deaths and don't want to risk being one themselves, etc, etc. Life-of-the-mother stats only cover near-death abortions, not medical abortions that are precautionary-but-warranted.     Stats are a tricky thing sometimes... there are plenty of factors the other way as well... deaths caused by abortion are counted as maternal deaths as well, plus other cases where the pregnancy wasn't really the cause of death.

If we simply edit the phrase “government can force me to carry a pregnancy to term” with “government can force me not to murder someone” and your question has been answered.

As for black women dying at higher rates, that’s due to poverty and not having regular doctors visits while pregnant that would actually catch the extreme cases.

We’re arguing opinions not the way things are currently  This isn’t a logical comeback either because no pregnancy isn’t a crime for obvious reasons. These two metaphors are not a direct comparison as I said earlier because there’s little factors like that on both sides. But no putting a baby in your womb isn’t a crime the way putting someone in the hospital is. But how does that negate everything else ? That’s just pointing out a factor in it. If the person dies you will be charged much harder than if they live. If you go through with a pregnancy you won’t be charged with anything and if you abort and kill a child, in this hypothetical scenario, you’d be charged with the death.  The only difference is that one small piece that’s different based on the nuances of both situations that aren’t the same   And my whole point once again is that body autonomy isn’t the issue it’s responsibility and other factors.

It just doesn't work like that. One doctor may interpret the same results one way and another doctor another way based on experience.
