Meanwhile, pregnancy is a direct consequence of sex.  Similarly, to stop ""getting murdered"" the other person doesn't have to do anything.  THey just don't brutally murder you.  This is in contrast to an abortion, which is an active action that must be taken.  If no action is taken, a child you helped create now exists and needs to be taken care of.  Full stop.  A better analogy might be driving and car accidents.  If you crash into something, even by mistake, you are responsible for making things right for what you have done.  Even if you don't want to.

282789;Down that path lies madness.  You start by telling people that they can't have children if they have had past miscarriages.

You outlaw meat products.  Are some deaths preventable by not allowing you to drive cars?  You outlaw private transportation.  All deaths are preventable by simply having no children, ever.    As I said, I think it is valid to ask someone to strongly consider not having a child if they have a history of miscarriage.  However, obligating them not to by law is not appropriate.    Preventing someone from deciding to kill someone is entirely do-able and something we can expect of someone.    Preventing someone from doing anything that might potentially cause someone to die someday is not only the end of liberty, it's also impossible and adds an unbound obligation to people in a way that telling them they need to endure a pregnancy is not.;0;0_abortion_abortions_fetus_pregnancy;against;for;
185589;And in what way is Abortion Healthcare?;0;0_abortion_abortions_fetus_pregnancy;against;neutral;
29736;I would save the infant. This isn’t a hard question and it’s not the “gotcha” you think it is.   Women are not being given the choice between killing an infant or killing a fetus during an abortion. You can value both. This is by definition a false dichotomy.;0;0_abortion_abortions_fetus_pregnancy;neutral;for;
38278;Birth especially is grievous bodily harm.;0;0_abortion_abortions_fetus_pregnancy;neutral;for;
156200; My reason for not allowing late term abortions is that when the fetus becomes viable, the woman now has a *new* option to back out of a pregnancy, which is to just give birth. The definition of fetus viability means that the fetus can survive outside the mother, so there’s no reason to abort. The fetus doesn’t have to use the mother’s body so she can cut off access to her body and her organs. Before viability, the the only option that women have to back out of a pregnancy is to abort. So bodily autonomy is respected in all cases. Also, remember that I said that abortion is healthcare (based on the definition of healthcare which doesn’t include whether it’s legal or not), and when the fetus becomes viable, women now have a new option to get healthcare without aborting.   If you hold that view, you have to show consistency in your view. Otherwise, what’s stopping people from conveniently applying their morals when they want to? Morals are subjective but *moral consistency* is important. In the car accident scenario, you took an action that had a risk of hurting someone else and yourself and that risk ended up occurring, but you still deserve healthcare and the government still can’t force you to donate organs or body parts in that case even if the other person would die. The pregnancy situation is *directly* analogous so the same rules should apply. If you don’t agree, then you need to present an objective argument why, not just say it’s because it’s what you personally believe. Because then I can easily just counter that I disagree because it’s my personal belief and we would never get anywhere.     When you give someone any power, there will always be someone who misuses it. Always. This doesn’t apply to just abortions. Most people use knives to cut vegetables and meat, but some psychos use it to kill innocent people. Most people use cars responsibly to get to places, but some people drive drunk or irresponsibly and end people’s lives. Most people use controlled medication responsibly, but some people will abuse those medications or give it to other people irresponsibly. The truth is that anytime you give people something, someone will misuse it, but that doesn’t mean most people will. Abortion is a difficult decision for a lot of women. I’ve heard so many pro-choice women saying that they personally would never get an abortion but they can’t choose for other people. I’ve heard of so many women who were literally pressured to get an abortion but still chose to keep the baby. Will some women misuse abortion and treat it like some sort of birth control? Sure, but you can’t take away something from a majority of people just because a small group of people would misuse it. Because then you would have to take away cars, planes, knives, controlled medication, hammers, guns, etc. Anything that someone could use to harm another person. Again, this is to maintain moral consistency.   Also, I just want to reiterate that bodily autonomy is important not because I say so or that it’s what I personally value. Like I said in my previous comment, you have to draw boundary on ownership when it comes to enforcing your morals. I can’t tell you what to do with what you own and you can’t do that to me. If we started doing that, no one would get anywhere, because as soon as you force someone to do something, they can force you to do something to cancel it out. The government also has to respect ownership. The reason that parents have to use their resources on kids is because they voluntarily consented to it in order to have parental rights. The reason that the government can take our tax money is that we consent to it by using federal services like roads, police, the justice system, etc. There’s a lot of things people do that I don’t think they should but I can’t control because I have no rights over them. I can’t force rich people to donate money to the poor because it’s not my money. I can’t force people not to say mean things to other people because it’s their voice and they have freedom of speech. So you’re right that people do a lot of things that other people would think they shouldn’t, but that doesn’t mean they can force them to stop.;0;0_abortion_abortions_fetus_pregnancy;for;against;

95211; Lol, nobody lost their abortion rights when Democrats were in charge of the relevant institutions. Texans didn't lose abortion rights under Ann Richards, and Americans didn't lose abortion rights when there was a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, either. I'm sorry you're confused, but it was ~~conservatives~~ reactionaries who did both of those things. All you're doing is shifting blame from Republicans, where it belongs, onto Democrats. It's called [Murc's Law](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=murc%27s%20law).   Codification isn't the answer people think it is. A Supreme Court that can overturn a half-century-old precedent can just as easily find a statute unconstitutional. It's what they did in *Shelby County*, it's what they did in *Brnovich*, and it's what they did in *Bruen*.  Americans didn't lose abortion rights because of anything Biden or Democrats did or didn't do. Democrats didn't legislate away anyone's abortion rights. Americans lost their abortion rights because RBG failed to timely retire, and because American voters failed in nearly a decade of elections, which allowed Republicans to take away abortion rights.  If they'd elected a Democratic Senate majority in 2014, which would've let Obama fill Scalia's seat, there would be no Gorsuch. That would've given us a 5-4 liberal majority. They failed again in 2016, electing Trump and a GOP Senate majority instead of Clinton and Democratic majorities, giving us Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. That gave us a 5-4 reactionary majority. Then they failed again in 2018, giving us Barrett, and a 6-3 reactionary majority. Then they did the absolute bare minimum in 2020, electing a razor-thin Democratic margin in the House, and a literal zero-seat margin in the Senate.  There was no reason to codify abortion rights prior to 2017, because any bill that could actually have passed would've offered weaker protections than Roe already provided. It would've been legislating *away* abortion rights! But, to the extent you think it would've been worthwhile (you're wrong), the last chance they had to do so was during the 111th Congress, the first half of Obama's first term. Was there any movement to codify abortion rights back then? No. For the 112th-116th Congresses, it was impossible, because voters made it impossible. And in the 117th Congress, it was theoretically possible, except, as you already pointed out, they don't have the votes to either overcome or abolish the filibuster. Because, again, voters did the bare minimum in 2020. So you claim they could've done it, but then admit they actually couldn't. And, again, it wouldn't actually do what you want it to do in the first place, even if they did have the votes for it. Which they don't.  Losing abortion rights was a forgone conclusion after 2016. It's just that it took another six years to find a case and for that case to work its way to to the Supreme Court. You don't protect abortion rights by sometimes electing Democrats and sometimes electing Republicans, and hoping Democrats can do enough while they're in power to prevent Republicans from undoing it when they're in power. That's not how it works! You protect abortion rights by electing Democrats, at every level of government, in every single election, so Republicans never have an opportunity to take those rights away in the first place. If we'd elected Democratic majorities in 2014, 2016, and 2018, and elected Clinton over Trump, Dobb wouldn't have even been heard in the Supreme Court, and *Roe* and *Casey* would still be good law.   It's called choosing your battles. There is a finite amount of time and resources, and there's an opportunity cost to pursuing a bill that's doomed to fail, in that it means those resources can't be used to pursue another bill that could actually pass instead.   Lol, what did which Republicans do when? Citations needed.   Prove it. Elect all Democrats, and see what happens. Take away all their excuses you think they use. Filibuster becomes irrelevant, parliamentarian becomes irrelevant, the VP breaking ties becomes irrelevant, absences and vacancies become irrelevant. Or hell, try even just electing filibuster- and veto-proof supermajorities in both houses of Congress. Then it won't even matter who wins the presidency, because they'll have the votes to override any President's veto.;0;0_abortion_abortions_fetus_pregnancy;for;neutral;

But doctors, well, they're actually performing the procedure. I know not of what doctors do when I go under, but I would hope they do.

155403;I’m not an absolutist. I don’t think the car accident scenario has to be thought of the same way as abortion.   You’re not required to donate your organs because of a ton of factors. I’ve already explained that part of it. If that person dies you’re gonna be charged still though and face repercussions. It’s just a completely different scenario than abortion I don’t see how it’s comparable.   It doesn’t apply to pregnant women because sex=pregnancy. That’s it. That’s what sex is for on a basic level. We have sex for fun sure but we know the risk. And that risk is a chance we take. And remember I’m arguing for the idea that you SHOULD have a chance in early term to abort just not after a certain period of time. But not based on body autonomy, based on this life isn’t even a life yet. I think body autonomy is irrelevant in this situation. I’m not gonna be an absolutist for body autonomy and say that every scenario should be the same. I think you chose to do something with the risk of bringing a child into the world and you should take responsibility for it. If you can’t abort it when it’s not formed then you should take responsibility for that now formed child just as you would if it was outside of the womb.   I’m not gonna sit here and try to say that you getting hurt in a car accident should be applied the same way as abortion. It’s hurting my head even trying to compare the two.  I think early term abortion you can compare and same with medical problems in pregnancies because yes you should have access to basic healthcare. But having late term abortions, there’s now a developed child involved that has to be taken into consideration and the abortion isn’t required.
