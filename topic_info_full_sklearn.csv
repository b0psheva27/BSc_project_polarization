Remember when they turned up the fear porn and made us believe that Russia is just gonna roll over the whole continent and invade xyz nato country? Just so that the governments can push through huge increases in the military budgets. Germany alone spend over 100‚Ç¨ Billion for that despite the fact that no Russians soldier will ever get close to our borders, for different reasons, not only because their aim isn't to blindly annex land, any land, or to attack nato countries.   They (Russia and the separatists) only want to secure key areas where russians and native russian speakers live who are not statisfied with the current Kiev regime. The RU Gov would be stupid trying to integrate people who are hostile towards them into their country, they would pose a more severe risk to Russia than the Ukrainian Military with it's NATO backing as the threat would come from within. Given the current numbers of dead civilians (6.8k), it doesn't look like anyone wants to depopulate Ukraine to annex it.  But: 8 million people left the country and many more millions are internally displaced, it could very well be that Western Ukraine and Central Ukraine (or most of it) actually gained in population now compared to pre-war. The regions where the population decreased drastically are where the war takes place, Donbas and much of the South.   Russia and the separatists securing 1/5 or maybe even 1/3 of Ukraine for the security of the Russophiles in Ukraine (there were about 10m of them pre-war) is not an european problem but a problem for the puppet gov in kiev. If they wanted to annex as much as possible they could have flattened every major city in Ukraine, like half a year ago, Russia certainly has enough capabilities to pull that off."", 'People who have substantial income potential can could choose to live anywhere because of the nature of their job very often choose to live in cities. They continue to do so in many cases, even after they have children. And not for nothing people who have basically endless wealth choose to live in cities.  I understand that not everything is import to everyone and people like different things - but is it really hard to figure out that somebody might not want to live in a town where the fancy restaurant is an Olive Garden and the most exciting theater you can see is the local high school production of Our Town?   And that type of town is totally fine if that‚Äôs what you would like and I can understand why people might like it. But this idea that nobody actually wants to live in cities even though living in cities is tremendously expensive is a mix of just having no fucking idea what the city is like even if you live in one because you listen listen to enough right wing media and the ability on the right to reject the basics of what the market reveals. It‚Äôs complete feels before reals.', ""Suggesting the humans should stop driving cars and fly instead by growing wings is not a realistic proposition. What is offered must be attainable or it is a waste of time and attention. Elizabeth Warren has some excellent bills that have not gotten passed. She needs more progressives elected and for the MSM to educate people on how they would work and encourage people to hound their representatives to support her. I am not interested in pissing in the wind. Yes we need to undo Citizens  United, to expand our Supreme Court, to elect people who don't just serve the 1%. We need to do a great many things but that is not going to happen as long as the American people keep flopping back and forth preventing either party from delivering or accomplishing more that the bare minimum. Historically the economy and human rights do better under Democrats but they are blocked every 2 years. Decades ago they tried to deal with climate change, immigration reform and other national interests. They keep getting slapped down for it so back away.  After 50 years of watching this I have little hope for real progress. Americans are who they are.""]"

The model is a business purchasing a capital asset and using profits to finance it.    Why? This is a business so why should it not be governed by the same rules as any other aspect.   I mean renting a car is more expensive than a car payment (over that same time period). Why would you assume renting real estate to be different?   This is totally ignorant of the totality of the picture. You are expecting a landlord to *not* use profits from an activity to *pay for the required capital assets*? A mortgage is merely a loan like any other. Do you not expect General Motors to inflate the cost of cars to pay for manufacturing equipment? it is the same concept.   And to be clear here. Rent prices are NOT set by mortgage costs. Rent prices are set be availability, quality, and demand. If you have more availability than demand, you have cheaper rents. if you have more demand than availability - you get higher rents.   The market for rentals must bear the cost for a mortgage payment for this to even exist. If rent costs *don't* bear this, you simply won't have businesses look to purchase properties to rent. It's fundamental business. A business would have to want to operate at a *loss* to do this. There is only a small niche case where the business/owner wants the property and is using tenants to offset some of the acquisition cost where it would happen.  Basically, it boils down to you don't want renting properties/landlords to be governed by the same rules as every other business."", '*social housing...*', 'He should pay rent to you']"

I don't like what he does, but I think this is worse.  What it seems like she plans to do is run as an independent and hold the Democratic Party hostage. If she were truly planning to do the identical thing as Bernie, she'd run in the primary as a Democrat, decline the nomination, and then run as an independent in the general.  But if she tried that, I'd put money on it that she would lose the primary, unlike Bernie.

There\'s strategy, planning, choices, proficiencies, flaws, etc. and you set up and play the game you can--but, there\'s an ocean of chaos and randomness in it.  It\'s spinning plates and juggling risk.  Clinton didn\'t lose /because/ some single thing was done wrong or went bad--as people claim she shoulda woulda coulda campaigned elsewhere, differently, etc. or heeded this or that polling or advice or ritual or tradition or habit or strategy.  Clinton lost because there is or was no more reviled human being in high politics than Hillary Clinton except, maybe, George W. Bush. And that rage and hate and dislike was built carefully, over time and since the 90\'s when people saw that she had ambitions greater than being Barbara Bush or Nancy Reagan and qualifications to back it.  They knew the first woman President had a high likelihood of being Hillary Clinton since the late 90\'s. Very high. And that the Democrats would come together like a leviathan with the Bill Clinton inroads to all sorts of traditionally difficult communities to attract and so much money it would sicken everyone. They knew the moment she announced, more than half the nation (way more) would leap to the historic moment.  And then she became the junior Senator from New York and showed she was a policy wonk and real player and they shit themselves harder.  And they breathed a tiny sigh of relief that she might get backseated by a black man--maybe the only thing that could have done it.  And then she became a devastatingly capable Secretary of State.  And they were going to have to deal with one of the most qualified human beings to ever run for the office of President.  With money.  With history.  With acumen. With allies.  And the right... in the 90\'s... in the 00\'s... in the 10\'s... Fox and Breitbart and Townhall and Rush and Hannity and every talking head they have and old white men with lots of money and reeling from a shellacking (twice) by that black man (the junior of the two, widely regarded as the less scary of the two for the right) who managed to break the gridlock of health care in the US wide open and recapture the pop culture imagination of a nation that hadn\'t had that since Bill--the GOP being notoriously shit at doing that, last time being Reagan in the mid-80\'s...  ...all those c\\*\\*ts...  ...at every stage of that narrative...  ...from Bill\'s terms in office...  ...through Bush...  ...through Obama...  ...they have spent fortunes in political and real capital and endless hours of footage and recording and events and ads and hearings trying, desperately, to invent a version of Hillary Clinton that would turn off that 10% of the nation that might still be open to shitting on her.  Because she\'s old.  Because she\'s shrill. Because she\'s a bigot.  Because she\'s ""elite"".  Because she\'s a liar.  Because she\'s a criminal.  Because she\'s not the traditional picture of a President.  (all things Mr. Trump is)  AND because she left Americans to die. And because there are conflicts in the world that have gone poorly. And because she\'s a woman. And because she\'s ""establishment"".  And most of the nation looked at these caricatures and ignored them--because they\'re obvious.  And some of those 10% believed them.  One of the strands of spaghetti on the wall.  I believe, personally and that\'s worth nothing (I accept and even agree), that perhaps the most qualified person to be the American President in my lifetime was either Hillary Clinton or George H.W. Bush.  On sheer experience and paper.  I also believe a Clinton Presidency would have brought about a conflict with Russia and expanded and strengthened NATO--and then a victory in that conflict. Likely in Ukraine. I believe the ACA would have been given fresh legs and cleaner and more expanded access--continuing to move the needle on how many Americans are insured from Obama\'s years. I believe her administration would recognize the need to reinvent the Democratic Party after their wins into a 21st century party long and truly well ahead of the right by many years and the result of that would have been voting rights and family-friendly policies (more tax breaks for ""families""--an ugh for me, not having kids, but ok and it plays well with middle American; family leave--same); equal pay--not impacting me, likely; some kind of public college support--not impacting me; and an infrastructure bill that would make the early 20th century blush.  And the right would have lost their collective minds, but continued the ""soul searching"" they started with Obama and continued when he won re-election. We might have a more calcified ""Tea Party"", but I think we\'d have seen a quicker move from the young Republicans (who want a career and future for themselves, too, and will long outlive the relics in charge) to swallow more libertarian pills to avoid the 20th century culture wars and their empty value.  Young men touting Rogan rather than Rush. All opposing the anti-Thatcher (in their eyes) and her matronly old grip on power.  Cilnton was done dirty.  I say this as someone who was not excited about a Clinton Presidency and someone who recognizes the Clinton machine for it\'s abuses and sins.  She was done dirty.  But, credit to the old girl (with utmost respect), it took an army whole decades to bring that woman down. From a strategic point of view?  A fortune in political capital and real capital was spent barely keeping the Presidency from Hillary Clinton.']"

There are also like maybe a hundred meta-anarchists in the world, so that\'s an extremely unfair determination of what we do. Likewise, if someone you met *was* a Christian Anarchist, they wouldn\'t necessarily tell you, because a lot of Anarchists have the same attitude as you toward them, and they\'re likely sick of defending themselves repeatedly. Same with other minority Anarchist positions. They\'re not necessarily going to reveal this, if they\'re sick of answering the same questions again and again. I\'ve never met a tankie in real life, but I know they exist out in the world, some of them agitating for their own beliefs.         Sadly, no. There are a lot of single-flavor Anarchists who want their favorite specific Anarchist system to be the only one. I mostly see this with AnComs, but I\'ve seen other Anarchists do it too. Anarchists are not exempt from petty infighting about which Anarchist system is ""reaaaaally"" Anarchist. Meta-Anarchism is, currently, a fringe position within Anarchism. Related things like Anarchism-without-adjectives are also trying to cut through the infighting, but when you get down to brass tacks with some of them, they also have a favorite Anarchist flavor that they hope is ""the"" outcome of revolution, as though there can be only a single system that results.         Eh. Political action is organized on the basis of political ideology, and political ideology comes from the juxtaposition of idealized systems (political philosophy, including that of Anarchists) and reality. So an Anarchist essayist composing a work outlining a new flavor of Anarchism (say, meta-anarchism) is contributing to Anarchism in a different way.      I find it funny that many of us will reference Marx, who only wrote and spoke about his ideas, then turn around and call any Anarchist thinker who isn\'t going out and doing Anarchist praxis an ""armchair Anarchist."" There\'s no such thing as an ""armchair Anarchist,"" besides perhaps someone who secretly believes in Anarchism, but never tells anyone anywhere, and does nothing on this basis, even private, individual praxis. If you do absolutely anything with Anarchism, including just telling people you are, then you are doing Anarchism, because that builds awareness of Anarchism, the ideology. One person who tells each of their friends or coworkers or whoever about Anarchism might create three people going out and doing other Anarchist praxis who otherwise might never have arrived at that.']"

A small car can be electric. And small EVs today are more efficient than small ICE cars. And hybrids are not better than EVs.', ' BEVs are indeed more efficient, but the Tesla chargers along the way would require being able to deliver at any moment in time the full current needed for a 70% ""quick"" charge, that for an increasing number of Tesla trucks on the road. That is on top of the car supercharger network that they still need to maintain.  If a person in an electric Tesla car arrives at a supercharger and for some reason there is a wait time or the supercharger delivers a limited charging rate, that\'s inconvenient but not a big deal for most cases. However that can\'t simply not happen with trucks, or companies and truckers will run away from that.  I honestly don\'t think Tesla will be able to honor their claim of green energy for Tesla trucks in their super chargers. Most renewables have an intermittent production, therefore energy must be stored locally at the supercharger site. Since it\'s Tesla we are talking about that would be for sure stored in batteries... which again would be better used in city cars. Tesla can plug the truck superchargers into the grid, but then it\'s going to be hard for them to guarantee a constant charging rate for the semi trucks.  Hydrogen refueling is almost as quick as diesel refueling, wait times are less of an issue in this case. Also, hydrogen refueling stations do not need to produce hydrogen insitu, hydrogen can be carried around like we do with Diesel. It just solves so many hurdles...  Think about it: Tesla is not putting batteries into everything that moves because it\'s what makes the most sense in each case. They are just monetizing the tech they acquired and work well for cars. Other companies that are not as heavily invested into battery electrics can opt for other techs, that make more sense in each case. Toyota came to the realization that hydrogen makes the most sense for trucks and I think that is reasonable.', "" How many tons is a full load ?  Are those 500 miles in ideal conditions or is it driving through mountains ? At what cruising speed ?  Those specs are as stated by Musk. Can you please share what is the weight or capacity of the Tesla semi battery pack ? Oh, no you can't. That is a trade secret guarded by Tesla !  Until independent people start showing up with real numbers from driving in actual real world business, those  claims belong in the same bin as all other false claims by Musk.  I'm sorry I don't jump into the Tesla fanboi bandwagon .    You are not getting it.  Experts say we don't have and won't have the near term lithium production capabilities to sustain the electrification of the car fleet, much less the car fleet plus trucks and whatever Musk thinks putting batteries into next.  On top of that, the energy density of lithium batteries doesn't scale well with the driving range. While a city car can afford carrying around a half ton battery, that weight and battery space is much more significant in a semi truck, to the point of eating away cargo space.  Batteries do not make any sense in electric semi trucks and that's why they should use hydrogen instead and spare the much needed lithium for city cars.""]"

I am using ""best use"" to mean the use that maximizes rent flows (excluding cash flow from improvements) to society, so as to minimize the opportunity cost to society of allowing private enclosure of the land.  For example, under your definition, the best use of a site for a private landowner might be to develop it into a skyscraper. But the best use of that same site for society would take into consideration a wide range of factors, including access to green space, creating local public goods, historical architecture and aesthetics, *etc*.  In short, best-use under full LVT maximizes the social welfare function, whereas best-use under the status quo maximizes the return to the landowner. This is what I meant by saying a ""completely different market,"" above.   LVT *compels* best-use, which changes the market price for the site.  * Today, the parking lot owner can sit back on their laurels, invest no capital, do no work, and watch their site appreciate in land value as the local community and economy is built up around them. The owner may choose to never sell to you‚Äîever‚Äîif they own outright in fee simple absolute. The result is transfers of land are rare, as you pointed out in your other comment about land\'s illiquidity, meaning the supply of land is suppressed. * Today, improving the property increases the parking lot owner\'s tax burden, which creates an incentive not to make improvements. Conversely, full LVT forces the owner to make improvements, which are not taxed, or else transfer the property to someone who will. Again, the effect is to increase supply of both land and improvements. * A revenue-neutral shift of the tax base off wages and savings and onto land values increases real disposable income. Under the status quo, taxes on wages and savings are passed through the economy until they fall on land values (a principle known as ""all taxes come out of rent"" or ""ATCOR""). Replacing taxes on labor and capital with taxes on land increases demand for land. Demand is further increased by eliminating dead-weight loss caused taxes on labor and capital (""excess burden comes out of rent"" or ""EBCOR""). * The net effect of the aforementioned is to raise the value of land above current market prices. Again, bear in mind the market price for land in its best-use under full LVT reflects *the opportunity cost to society of enclosing the land in private use*, not the so-called \'best-use\' of maximizing returns for the landowner.   Might I suggest you reserve your conclusion until you better understand the idea, for starters. As I offered, I can send you the article I am working on that will lay out in more detail the idea, but to answer your questions briefly:  * All sites would be auctioned on an annual or periodic basis. Anyone can bid on the site. * There are no mortgages for land under a full LVT. Full LVT = 100% rate of taxation on land value, which eliminates private ownership and effectively socializes land. Under full LVT, people could still get mortgages to buy improvements, but no one can \'own\' land like today, so there would be no mortgages on the land itself. People would have to come up with the savings for only 1 year of taxes to pay the LVT, presuming annual auctions/reassessment, and any improvements on the site. * If you read Tideman\'s proposal I linked you to, he recommends *requiring* bidders to bid on multiple properties in his options-based proposal. But, in short, yes, you could bid on as many sites as you liked each year, limited only by how much savings you have to necessarily put all sites you occupy into best-use. * If the highest bid at auction exceeds the current tax burden, yes, bidding would increase the tax burden on the current occupant of the site, if they exercised their option to remain in possession by paying marginally more than the winning bid. People are not going to overbid as the winner of the auction becomes liable for the tax burden for the year. We expect the tax burden for (pretty much) every site to increase each year, so long as population is growing and technology is developing.   Now this is getting to the crux of the issue. We *can* accurately assess land value separate from improvements using public auctions each year, but how do we transfer occupancy rights to the highest bidder while making sure the current occupant\'s equity in their improvements realizes fair market value?  As previously mentioned, one solution is to have a Vickrey auction to determine land value (*i.e.*, the annual tax burden), with self-assessment via Harberger pricing to value improvements. The winner of the auction becomes liable for the tax burden and takes possession of the improvements by buying out the prior occupant\'s equity in the improvements at the Harberger price, which would be public information prior to the auction. Alternatively, the auction winner and prior occupant retain the freedom to contract around the Harberger price, *e.g.*, the prior occupant retains equity in their improvements and leases them to the next occupant.  I\'m going to flesh out this idea more in my article.']"

The actual age gap isn't the issue.  If a 75-year-old dates a 50-year-old, most people don't care‚Äîstill a 25-year age gap but in much closer stages of life.  But when you're a 50 year which dates a 25 year (especially if you show a pattern of doing it), it begs the question, why? Assuming you aren't just hooking up with the other person, why do you want to be in a relationship with someone you probably have little in common with?  Are you super immature?  Or is it more nefarious because you know you can use the age gap to manipulate the other person in many ways? Even if you're intentions are good large age-gap relationships can lead serious issues, with one person taking advantage of the other. The age gap is an indicator the relationship may be unhealthy. It doesn't automatically mean it is, but it's a pretty good indicator, especially if the younger person is in their teen or early twenties.   I'm a gay woman getting close to middle age. Do I find women in their 20s objectively attractive? Sure. Would I date one? No. Because I would like to have something in common with my partner. I would like them to be at a similar stage in life, both emotionally and career-wise. And yeah, I'm going to side-eye most people (regardless of gender) who date people much younger than them. Especially if they actively seek out those relationships because it means there's a particular reason they want someone much younger. And almost none of those reasons are wholesome.   Yes, there are many ways people can be abusive in relationships.  Did someone imply that non-age gap relationships were always rainbows and butterflies?

Agai,n while there are exceptions, it's not a little-known fact that age gap relationships tend to be unsuccessful, for a multitude of reasons.   Possibly, it's still not the majority.

This will absolutely have an impact on the cash flow and business profits of the business.   Also, the original comment was not focused as much on table-side service as you are.

That's literally what it says."", 'The collective rights claim started in the 1870s, by judges who wanted to deny people of their rights. It was strongly taken up by progressives, as a way to deny people of rights they did not want them to exercise. It was also rejected by Miller, Heller, McDonald, Bruen, and Caetano.   The founding fathers never talk about collective rights. It‚Äôs not mentioned in our founding documents. What they did talk about, repeatedly, and what is recognized in our founding documents, are individual rights. Our country is founded on the concept of individual rights.   Even with the argument that 2A only applied to militia service, you‚Äôre talking about an individual right, because militia members are expected to supply their own arms; thus they must individually have the right to possess arms. Furthermore, 2A protects a right to keep, meaning own, arms. It doesn‚Äôt protect a right to bear community held arms in militia service. Personal ownership is an individual right.   Those who hold a collective rights position on 2A are those who want to deny rights. The writings of the founding fathers and the ratifying debates are very clear that it is an individual right that all Americans have.  As far as 2A being a right that is intended to allow the people to resist tyranny: it was mentioned in the oral arguments for Bruen. It was also noted, in the McDonald case, that 2A was enumerated to allow the people to resist a tyrannical government.   The Heller ruling specifically notes that 2A was enumerated because the founding fathers feared the government would disarm the people, and this would allow a standing army to rule. In other words, it was enumerated to allow the people to resist tyranny. Heller further notes that, although this purpose is written in the prefatory clause as a reason for the right, it is not the only purpose for the right. Notice, it did not say that this was not a purpose for the right; just that it was not the *only* purpose for it.  What did the heller ruling say?  1. 2A protects an individual right, not a collective right  2. 2A did not just protect those arms useful for a militia, but all arms commonly used at the time; meaning it doesn‚Äôt just protect the keeping of arms in use at the time of ratification. It does not state that it only protects those arms used for self defense; although, in truth, all arms can be used for self defense. 3. The constitutional standard of review for 2A is one of text informed by the history and tradition of gun laws at the time of ratification.   What did the Bruen ruling say?  1. There is a right to bear arms outside of the home.   2. States could not have arbitrary conditions for carry permits; that prohibit average Americans, who are not prohibited people, from exercising their right to bear arms.   3. Self defense is a constitutionally valid reason to be armed.   4. It reaffirmed the standard of review for gun regulation, that was established by heller. In order to show a modern gun law is constitutional, it is the burden of the government to show a corresponding law from the time of ratification. Laws from the time of reconstruction can be used, although they will carry less weight, as long as they do not contradict the tradition of the time of ratification. It did not establish that the only purpose for 2A is self defense.  You don‚Äôt have to wait to see if this standard of review applies to 2A, as a whole, or just CCW. Besides the fact that the language of both Heller and Bruen plainly stated that all gun regulations have to pass this standard of review, the Supreme Court took up a few AW bans and mag bans, after the Bruen ruling was released. They struck the lower courts‚Äô rulings in favor of these laws, and sent the cases back to the lower courts with insurrections to make new rulings **based off of the standards set by the Bruen ruling**.  So, it‚Äôs very obvious that the standard applies to 2A, as a whole.   A militia is a military force drawn from the civilian population *to supplement the army during an emergency*. Throughout all of history, militiamen have been required to furnish their own arms and equipment. You can go back to Anglo Saxon England and see that Fyrd( militia) members were expected to have their own arms. The king did not supply their arms.  NG members do not supply their own arms. The government arms and equips them. Yes, they have limited times of service, like a part time military, but their required NG time is not limited to training. They also do not supplement the other military branches, as additional forces to aid the primary military. They are put to use, instead of other branches, the same way each other branch gets applied to its own tasks. I imagine you are familiar with the army reserve. They serve one weekend a month and a two week summer camp. Very similar to the NG, really; except they don‚Äôt get called into service unless the regular army needs more soldiers. In spite of this similarity, the army reserve isn‚Äôt considered a militia. It‚Äôs part of the army: meaning it‚Äôs standing army. The NG is considered another branch of the military.   ‚ÄúThe NG is a state based military force that becomes part of the reserve components of the US Army and US Air Force when activated for federal missions. It is a military reserve force composed of NG *military* members or units of each state...‚Äù  https://constitutionalmilitia.org/national-guard-not-a-militia/  DeSantis planned to revive Florida‚Äôs state militia, although there is a Florida NG, and this is because the NG is not a state militia.   Your anecdote about Washington is being misapplied. Originally, the founding fathers had not wanted to give the federal government the power to even have a military. They wanted to solely use state militias for national defense, because standing armies get used against the people. They changed their minds about this, because they realized militias, alone, could not properly defend the country. So, they gave the government the power to have a standing army, and felt that the fact that all of the people would be armed would prevent that military from being used successfully against the people. It was always intended that all the people be armed in similar manner to the military, and history will show you that this was the state of things, until the 20th century. Therefore, by the Bruen standard of review, the unorganized militia ( meaning all of the people) definitely have a claim to all the weapons of a soldier.  ‚ÄúCongress have no power to disarm the militia. **Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American**.... [T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.‚Äù  -Tenche Cox    The number of civilian ( unorganized ) militias, in the US, has exploded over the last few years, so I think reality disagrees with you.   You don‚Äôt sound too skeptical of government to me. In fact, you seem to think our rights come from the constitution and the government, and that government has the just power to decide what our rights are and what their powers are. Our rights do not come from the government. They do not come from the constitution. They come ‚Äòfrom our creator‚Äô. They are natural rights. The constitution protects them. Government is not the supreme law of the land. The constitution is. Any law that contradicts the constitution is not valid- Alexander Hamilton.   If you let the government determine your rights, you will end up with no rights, and if you let the government determine its own limitations, it will have no limitations.  You should check out the Tenth Amendment Center. You‚Äôd be better informed of your rights and the constitution.  https://youtube.com/@TenthAmendmentCenter', 'First of all, there are no collective rights. That was a BS attempt to deny people their 2A rights, by progressives. All of the enumerated rights are individual rights. The founding fathers never even mention ‚Äòcollective rights‚Äô. The founding principles of this country, which informed the writing of the constitution, is the preservation of liberty: individual rights.   Heller and Bruen don‚Äôt restrict the right to one of self defense. In fact, the Bruen opinion actually mentions its purpose of defending liberty from our own government. They simply rule that it does apply to self defense; not being limited to arms useful for militia service. Also, while the Bruen ruling was directly about self defense being a valid reason for a carry permit, the standard of review it reconfirm, which was originally set by heller, doesn‚Äôt only apply to self defense. It applies to 2A, as a whole.   That standard being that it is the burden of the government to show that a gun regulation is supported by a similar gun regulation, for the same purpose, at the time of ratification. It allows laws from the time of reconstruction to be used for review, but only as they support the traditions from the time of ratification; not if they contradict the earlier sources.   As far as Gatling guns, they have been legal to own since their invention, in 1861. They still are. Machine guns were totally legal to own, with no government regulation, until 1934, and legal to own, with registration and a tax stamp, since then, until 1986. And, while you can‚Äôt own a machine gun made after that date, you can still own one made before then.   There are simply no laws, from the time of ratification, limiting the type of arms you could own. Therefore, no modern laws limiting the type of arms you can own are constitutional.  The common use standard, set by heller, doesn‚Äôt limit the protected arms to just those in common use for lawful purposes ( notice the ruling does not say for self defense). It simply states that no arms in common use for lawful purposes can be banned; meaning that no further review is necessary once common usage is established. The Caetano ruling set the bar pretty low, for common use.  On the issue of militias, the national guard is in no way a militia. It is a standing army, of paid regular troops. It‚Äôs just a state standing army. A militia is, by definition, a military force drawn from the civilian population to supplement the army during an emergency. It is not a regular paid military force.   The militia act asserts two types of militia: the organized militia and the unorganized militia. The organized militia is what is referred to in the constitution, where it states the federal government has the power to call forth the militia. It is under the command of the governor of each state.   The unorganized militia is all of the rest of the people, who may form militias to aid in the defense of the country or to resist government tyranny.   ""I ask who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.""  ‚Ä¢ \u2060George Mason, Address to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, June 4,   As far as 2A not having the purpose of allowing the people to defend their liberty from their own government, should it become tyrannical:  ""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every country in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops.""  ‚Ä¢ \u2060Noah Webster, An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution, October 10, 1787   ‚ÄúThe right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.""  ‚Ä¢ \u2060Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, 1833  ‚ÄúWho are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man gainst his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American.... [T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people."" (Tench Coxe, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.)  And, finally:  ‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness, That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, **That whenever any Form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it**...‚Äù  -the Declaration of Independence   Your assertions are ill informed and your air of superiority and derision unwarranted, as you are either disingenuous, ignorant of the facts, or , most likely, both.']"

Moishe and his parents were reportedly killed in Auschwitz, but his 5 sisters and younger brother all survived the camp (a miracle!) and when they returned to their old apartment in Brussels after the war, they found young Moishe\'s diary ""in an old shoebox in the attic"" (actually it was a box in the cellar) and it was published first in Israel in 1958.)  *1974 - Hahn, Lili. White Flags of Surrender. Washington, DC: R.B. Luce* (Records the observations of a young woman with a non-Jewish father and Jewish mother as the Third Reich slowly gained power in Germany. Not about camps. Not much about this one in general, but I have found an online copy so I might read it later.)  *1953 - Kalmanovitsh, Zelig. ‚ÄúA Diary of the Nazi Ghetto in Vilna.‚Äù YIVO Annual of Jewish Social Science 8* (Records the activities of a boy in the Vilna ghetto from June of 1942 to June of 1943 before he was deported and killed in a camp in Estonia.  Hard to find information but I would assume his diary was found ""in an old shoebox in the attic"" in Vilnius after his death. Reviewers say the diary is exceptionally written, considering the author was only 14 years old at the time.)  *1964 - Katzenelson, Itzhak. Vittel Diary (22.5.43-16.9.43). Tel Aviv: Ghetto Fighters‚Äô House* (Mostly about the Ghetto, but also a good deal about Treblinka where he and his family were killed in 1943. Ruth Adler, a German Jew from Dresden who had a British Palestinian passport, received permission to leave the country in an exchange for German Prisoners of War. In the leather handle of her suitcase, she smuggled a copy out of the Vittel Camp and then she went to Israel/Palestine, where the piece was first published in May 1945, after the death of the author. Again - this particular diarist was quite a gifted writer. One reviewer says - ""Katznelson was a poet and dramatist and it shows in his diary"")  *1983 - Kermish, Joseph, editor. ‚ÄúDaily Entries of Hersh Wasser.‚Äù Yad Vashem Studies 15* (Translation of a diary kept by Hersh Wasser, a Polish Zionist who was active in the effort to record life in the Warsaw Ghetto as part of the Ringelblum Archives. Wasser survived the Holocaust, and together with his wife, immigrated to Israel in 1950, where he died in 1981.  His diary with his remarkable experiences was published posthumously the year after his death.)  *1967 - Kermish, Joseph, editor. ‚ÄúExtract from the Diary of Abraham Levin.‚Äù Yad Vashem Studies 6* (Presents diary excerpts from June and July, 1942, kept by historian Abraham Levin in the Warsaw ghetto and stored as part of the Ringelblum Archives. Not much about the author. But I would bet it was published after his death. Feel free to correct me on that.)  *1973 - Klonitski, Aryeh. The Diary of Adam‚Äôs Father: The Diary of Aryeh Klonicki (Klonymus) and His Wife Malwina, with Letters Concerning the Fate of their Child Adam* (Translation of a diary kept by a husband and wife covering a two-week period during the final liquidation phase of Jews from the Galicia region. Documents the last weeks of their lives as they hide from the Nazis as well as their fears for their infant son.  The fate of the author is unknown, with some sources showing he died in 1943, and others saying he survived the war but was living in Ukraine and wanted nothing to do with his relatives.  At any rate, his diary was published ""in his name"" and who can say if he ever read it?  lol  I will stop there.  But ..  do you notice any commonalities?   First - there is barely anything about the camps written in those earlier diaries. It\'s mostly about the ghettos and ""general observations"" about what was going on.  Why werent camp survivors coming out in this time with their unbelievable experiences?  Second - with 1 possible exception up there all those diaries were published after the death of their author.  This seems to be a common thing.  Not sure why. Hmm. It would be cool to get to interview the author about the information in their diary, right?  The author could also get whatever attention/credit/adulations/money they are due that could maybe offset some of what they suffered, right?  But for some reason, these things always seem to come out after their subject is gone from this world.  Third - these rare diaries that have been found ""in shoeboxes in the attic"" after the deaths of their authors always seem to be *fantastically* written!  Wasnt anyone keeping an interesting/relevant diary who was just a .. shitty writer?  Apparently not.   And how many *werent* like that? How many were perfectly capable and educated adults? 10? 20? Surely a few, right?  Werent there even authors, playwrights, etc in the camps?  Talk about ""a good idea for a book"" and ""write about what you know"" .. right?  At any rate, those young diarists can be surprisingly excellent writers!  But .. why dont we have diaries from people who survived, and who released their dramatic diaries shortly after the war while they were alive?  Surely there were Germans who doubted the stories of the camps after the war, right?  Well these kind of people coming forward and sharing their experiences would have been extremely useful, no?', ' How is it possible to love a country with crimes worse than the Holocaust?']"

There are a whole bunch of interpretations but I‚Äôd think if what the KJV was based on was the correct texts to be translating into English the literal interpretations would better capture the meaning of the original texts and there is a Revised Edition King James Version that does that. It‚Äôs not from the 1600s, but the 1880s. The older 1600s text changes the wording a bit to try to ‚Äúcapture‚Äù the original meaning without interpreting it literally, which is quite literally the same way the Great Bible was translated from the very same texts the KJV was translated from originally.   This tells me that the Great Bible is roughly equivalent to the original KJV and the Young‚Äôs Literal Translation is roughly equivalent to the currently authorized version of the KJV still recognized as such in Britain. A lot of the other texts aim to make the wording more consistent with how people interpret the texts anyway like ‚Äúin front of the firmament‚Äù might be simply translated as ‚Äúin the sky.‚Äù In a way, that‚Äôs exactly what the original authors *meant* but they said that there was a firmament surrounding the sky - something the NKJV and ESV both mention, but the older KJV seems to suggest they fly **in** the firmament, rather that in front of it, which wouldn‚Äôt make sense ***unless*** you were to try to interpret a solid barrier into air that can be flown through.   What I‚Äôve been saying this whole time, more or less, is that you have no reason to limit yourself strictly to a 1611 text nobody even uses anymore when a lot of these others capture the original meaning of the text a lot better. Even the New King James Version does better at this than the original KJV. And if you don‚Äôt want to see anything about solid sky barriers you might read the Living Bible that is translated for a modern understanding of the world to hide just how wrong the text when read literally actually is.']

This is all possible because the student loans are guaranteed.  The school will get their money so they don‚Äôt need to make tuition affordable and make sure students can afford it.  On one hand this lets poor kids get an education, on the other hand it drives up the cost of tuition because everyone can afford college.', 'This is 6 years old, but it shows how much states have cut funding for higher education. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fancy-dorms-arent-the-main-reason-tuition-is-skyrocketing/  Edit  In 2000, Temple University was primarily a commuter school. On-campus dorms could house fewer than 4,000 students out of a total student body of more than 30,000. Most facilities were badly outdated, and the average student paid $12,800 a year (in 2016 dollars) in tuition to attend.  Today, Temple, where I work, looks very different. Beautiful new buildings are the norm rather than the exception. A recently built 24-story dorm and adjoining dining center highlights the university‚Äôs transition to a residential campus. Each of the dorm‚Äôs apartment-style suites comes equipped with a flat-screen TV and other amenities. The number of administrators in management and executive positions has grown by 40 percent to over 900. Oh, and tuition now runs $19,000 for the typical student after accounting for scholarships and other aid.  It‚Äôs tempting to blame Temple‚Äôs shiny buildings and new administrators for the big increase in tuition. But there‚Äôs another, much more important reason for the rising costs: Over the same period, Pennsylvania‚Äôs state government cut its per-student appropriations by $6,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars.  The rapid increase in the cost of college in recent decades ‚Äî and the associated explosion in student debt, which now totals nearly $1.3 trillion nationally ‚Äî is all too familiar to many Americans. But few understand what has caused the tuition boom, particularly at the public institutions that enroll roughly two-thirds of all students at four-year colleges. Many commenters,\xa0particularly\xa0in the\xa0popular press, focus on ballooning administrative budgets and extravagant student amenities. Those elements have played a role, to be sure, but by far the single biggest driver of rising tuitions for public colleges has been declining state funding for higher education.  It is true that today‚Äôs students enjoy better amenities ‚Äî usually in the form of nicer gyms, dorms and dining halls, though some campuses feature\xa0lazy rivers and climbing walls\xa0‚Äî than I or, especially, my parents did during our time in college. It is also true that today‚Äôs universities employ far more administrators and staff who don‚Äôt have any direct role in either research or instruction. When my father attended the University of Florida1\xa0in the 1970s, professors were required to also serve as academic advisors and meet individually with students to plan their schedules. Today, schools retain many staffers whose role is to assist both faculty and students. Some of those jobs are easy to mock: One\xa0frustrated grad student\xa0built a\xa0job-title generator\xa0that spits out bloated titles such as vice executive for the committee on dining relations.  Recent Stories from FiveThirtyEight  ÔøºTop Storiesby\xa0FiveThirtyEight00:3701:12ÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº33 Cool Charts We MadeIn 2022  And it is also true that professors (at least those on the tenure track) are paid better than the people who held those same jobs years ago. Average salaries for full professors (the highest rank) at\xa0top public institutions exceed\xa0$160,000 annually. Salaries for full professors have risen 12 percent in excess of inflation since 2000.  All of those trends add to the cost of college, but not by that much. At most, about a quarter of the increase in college tuition since 2000 can be attributed to rising faculty salaries, improved amenities and administrative bloat. By comparison, the decline in state support accounts for about three-quarters of the rising cost of college.  Consider Pennsylvania‚Äôs four public research institutions,2\xa0one of which is Temple.3\xa0Average tuition revenue per student (adjusted for inflation) increased by $5,880 between the 2000-01 and 2013-14 academic years (the most recent available data). State appropriations per student have declined nearly $4,000 over the same period, from about $7,750 to $3,900. Put another way, if Pennsylvania restored funding for higher education to its 2000 levels, Pennsylvania‚Äôs public research institutions could reduce tuition by nearly $4,000 per year without altering their budgets. For students, the impact could be even greater once loan fees and interest were taken into account.  By contrast, imagine that each of these institutions cut per-student spending for student services, administration and instruction back to 2000 levels, then passed those savings on to students in the form of lower tuition. How much would students save? Reducing student services would save each student $380 per year. Dropping all those new administrators would save $150 per student per year. And rolling back spending on faculty salaries would save $850 per year for the average student. Together, those three categories have added $1,380 to the cost of attendance since 2000, about a quarter of the total increase. At least some of that spending benefits students directly: Student-service spending has been found to increase the\xa0likelihood of graduating, and increased spending on instruction leads to\xa0higher earnings\xa0later in life.  National trends for all public four-year schools mirror those from the research institutions of Pennsylvania, although there are sizable differences across states, as the table below shows. In the median state, South Carolina, the decline in state appropriations explains 81 percent of the increase in tuition revenue. Only three states ‚Äî Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming ‚Äî have kept funding for higher education on pace with inflation and enrollment growth (represented by negative numbers in the table). In 17 states, the price of college would have actually\xa0declined\xa0since 2000 (states with a share greater than 100 percent in the table) if funding had been kept constant and the schools applied that money entirely to students‚Äô tuition bills. While state funding has rebounded somewhat during the economic recovery following the Great Recession, most states‚Äô increases have not kept pace with enrollment growth.']"

There's few talented CEOs and millions upon millions of unskilled laborers.  That's why there's such a pay discrepancy.

Envious people are not happy they have a job.  They feel exploited because Bezos makes far more than they'll ever make.  And thank God Bezos is greedy.  What if he decided to close his doors and discontinue Amazon?  Thousands of people would be out of work and no one would have the benefit of Amazon.  I'm glad he's greedy....I directly benefit.

Then there is the footage of the police opening the side doors for protestors to enter the building.  It's all very suspicious. The capitol police were clearly unconcerned or unprepared for the protests that the knew were going to happen they also knew the number  of high value legislators that would be on premises that day. But you are honestly going to tell me that you believe that in a nation where riots and violent protests are common place. Where we have the largest defense budget but that's all it takes to get into one of our most highly secured and protected buildings? REALLY?!?!?!?! Where were the capitol police? Why were they so unprepared,  why were so many helping the protestors, why did they refuse national guard and D.C. metro help in advance.   There's no way a logical person could honestly assess the situation and believe that anything. More than token attempt to hold protestors back was given. Come on.... Some one set that up for protestors to gain entery Idk if it was Trump in order to attempt to make a statement of Pelosi in order to silence Trumps demand for a recount. I can't say who was behind it but something was definitely up and ita disturbing how few people are capable of logically looking at something instead of swallowing the narrative fed to them.   Regardless one thing is for sure and that's the fact that it was a protest Nothing more, it wasn't an attempt to overthrow the government. Why do I say this? Because you are talking about the most heavily armed segment of America that was protesting but yet no one brought guns to overthrow the government, which is something that would be violent without question.....oh wait supposedly they found a single pipe bomb somewhere .... nice touch ü§£  How is this narrative not hilarious to more people?

They don‚Äôt care about the functionality of the school, they just want town, state, and governments to keep shoveling money into the school system. If the school system improves, then the easy money goes away. When these schools get their increased budgets, it goes directly into the pockets of admins.   The third hurdle is that teachers don‚Äôt want to teach at bad schools. The worst schools need the best teachers to offset the disadvantage the kids are at. But why would a good teacher waste their time working for a bad school? It‚Äôs dangerous for one. They also have very little power over the classroom. These bad schools also tend to be located in cities, so cost of living is a problem for them as well. The good teachers dip out after they realize they can‚Äôt save the school, leaving only the shitty teachers.

Where those violent criminals choose to break that social contract, we have the right to dispatch the threat with force, up to and including lethal force.

Just like it is in any other industry that wants to expand its labor pool. *Appearing* to be inclusive is the goal behind actually getting more numbers in the board.  Physical fitness standards have been loosening in the military for years. Is it because they don‚Äôt want to be fatphobic? No, it‚Äôs because the majority of enlisted roles are technical and they were losing out on retention and recruitment goals on those technical roles since America as a whole has gotten fatter. Now active field and combat roles have additional physical requirements.  The American military has also started to loosen its rules regarding usage of marijuana and anti-depressants for new recruits.

I was not part of a particularly religious household, but even I can acknowledge there\'s not actually a ""secular"" way to celebrate a Christian holiday..  The only reason Christmas feels like a secular holiday is because of the thin or complete lack of separation of church and state and the fact that most of these countries have Christianity as a cultural foundational theology. In a city that starts playing Christmas music in November, it\'s inescapable and participation is often forced in work contexts. A ""holiday"" party at work with a tree, lights, and presents the week before everyone gets Christmas off is just a Christmas party. There is nothing secular about this concept.   Like, it is literally a holiday to celebrate the birth of the Christian messiah. It\'s also not surprising that a Muslim person might be okay with the celebration of Christmas because they consider Jesus to be a prophet if not messiah.  Context actually matters here.   There are *courthouses* with Christmas trees and wreaths but never with a menorah. Never any that acknowledge the celebration of the pagan solstice outside of stolen tradition. Like, the fact that non-Christians engage with the commercialization of Christianity doesn\'t make it less of a religious holiday.', 'A few things.  1. Even *if* Christmas was on the 25th to replace a pagan holiday, this wouldn\'t make Christmas pagan, it would make it anti-pagan. Because it would be in opposition to a pagan holiday. As an example, Protestants celebrate ""Reformation Day"" on October 31st, in opposition to All Hallow\'s Eve which is a Catholic holiday. Does this mean Reformation Day is secretly a Catholic holiday? No, it\'s a Protestant holiday in opposition to Catholicism (not to mention that October 31st is when Luther did the whole 95 whatever thing, so there\'s a genuine reason for celebrating that on the 31st, just like there\'s a genuine reason for Christmas being on the 25th of December, which is that\'s it\'s 9 months after the Annunciation on the 25th of March).   2. Christmas was not meant to replace Saturnalia nor Sol Invictus. Saturnalia wasn\'t even on December 25th, and there\'s absolutely zero evidence for Sol Invictus (the solstice thing you mentioned) until the year 274 I think. There\'s evidence of Christians believing Jesus was born on December 25th and celebrating it that day as early as around the year 204. So if anything, Sol Invictus, the solstice celebrations, came *after* Christmas. If anything, the pagans stole it from the Catholics, not the other way around.  3. Why won\'t you type out God lmao, what\'s with the ""G_d"" thing?  Merry Christmas!', 'Because the religion of Christmas and the practical Christmas celebrations are two entirely different things.  I can celebrate Christmas as a holiday time with my family without it being at all tied to Christianity.

COVID replicates and produces a range of unknown proteins. Your body fights these off by making antibodies. A wide range of antibodies. When COVID mutates, which it does very frequently, your body will still have antibodies for some of the proteins in the new variant. This makes it easier to fight off new strains.  The mRNA vaccine turns your cell into a protein factory, not a vaccine factory as this video suggests. The mRNA vaccine tells your cell to produce the spike protein and your immune system creates antibodies for this protein.   What's the difference? The vaccine causes you to make specific antibodies instead of a range of antibodies. That's why you keep getting COVID with every new variant. That's why you catch the flu and a cold every year. A proper vaccine is IMPOSSIBLE. It's just meant to help lessen symptoms.  But let's look at what's being made, the spike protein. The spike protein is what needs to be researched more. These spikes are doing the damage to your heart (myocarditis), vascular cell walls(miniature blood clots) and they accumulate in your ovaries and gonads( causing a hormone imbalance).   You claim there is no replication, but the initial dosage correlates to how many cells are affected with the vaccine. As moderna had a higher dosage, we saw more adverse reactions with moderna.   It's very possible that the cells do replicate as studies have shown liver cells have undergone DNA changes to include the spike protein. If this is true, then there is replication.  Let's say it's not. The cell will continue producing the spike for it's life. The body will continue fighting the spike by producing antibodies and your immune system will remain elevated until these cells naturally die off. So although you will have antibodies, your immune system is at a temporarily weakened state for weeks minimum.  The antibody memory from vaccines has shown to wane just after a few months. Naturally immunity has no such issue.  Lastly, the virus targets your respiratory system where as the vaccine is entering your cardiovascular system and can literally go to any organ in your body. Do you want your heart cells producing spike proteins? Do you want your testes producing spike proteins?  The mRNA technology is a form of Gene therapy. Is the technology bad? No. It's quite amazing and may be the future of medicine. Is it ready for prime time? You could argue both yes and no. Is the spike protein toxic? It appears so!  So would you rather have a free floating spike protein traveling to all parts of your body? Or a spike protein attached to a cell?

You saying so does not make it so. Everything I wrote was correct, although it could be further expounded upon to provide more clarity. Furthermore, nothing I wrote contradicted itself, so I don't know were this idea is from.   I should have been more clear, I was talking about the slums you see in most of Africa and Asia, especially in India. Nobody actually owns the land the slums are on in any official or legal sense, nobody holds title to the land. What this means is that a person cannot seek any legal recourse for theft or damage, nor will anybody be punished for infringing on what the people own. This is why you see shacks built on top of or touching the shacks of others. A person cannot stop another from building on top of them or touching them, since they do not own their land. People cannot build nice homes or apartments in these places because they hold no title to land, meaning that it will be taken over by squatters before they can plan and construct something other than a basic shack. People cannot provide utilities to their homes for the same reason, having title means people tap into your power, water, sewage, etc. and you would have no legal recourse. There can be no planning and organization and vision for this area, since no land is secure and stable.   This is just not so. Capitalism is a system that recognizes private property and respects it, unfortunately, in many places there is no respect for private property and no protections for it, as in the case of the slums, where people have no legal or official title to land. Nobody recognizes the ownership of the land. There is a movement to help people in 3rd world countries get legal title to their lands so that they can seek recourse and protection, which is a great development."", 'Here is the most basic statement of civil property relationships:  *Blackstone\'s Commentaries on the Laws*:    **1st.** The lowest and most imperfect degree of title consists in the mere naked possession or actual occupation of the estate, without any apparent right or any shadow or pretence of right to hold or continue such possession. And at all events without such actual possession no title can be completely good.    **2d.** The next step to a good and perfect title is the right of possession, which may reside in one man while the actual possession is not in himself, but in another.    **3d.** The mere right of property, the proprietatis, without either the possession, or the right of possession, the mere right is in him, the jus merum, and the estate of the owner is in such cases said to be totally divested, and put to a right.    **4th.** A complete title to lands, tenements, and hereditaments. For it is an ancient maxim of the law that no title is completely good unless the right of possession be joined with the right of property, which right is then denominated a double right, jus duplicatum, or droit droit. //     2 William Blackstone, Commentaries 195  ""juris et seisinae conjunctio""...this is key', ' There\'s no such thing as ""the owner"", nor is land being sold against anybody\'s will. Empty land has no owner, by every legal definition it reverts to the public or the commons after years of disuse or having never been used. This is the fundamental problem: capitalist ideology propagates disinformation, as if there\'s existential squares written on a map somewhere by political sanctity.  Ownership is a broad spectrum of Rights receding and proceeding over time, the only issue are ""claims"" when it comes up in the judicial system. The state does not actually sell land, it sells deeds and titles. Land is just the surface of the earth and it doesn\'t move.  Here\'s an example of the contradiction:   Of course they do, ownership is established by law everywhere in the occupancy of land.   They do hold title to the land, hence the effort to formalize that as you mentioned later.   That\'s because their government is weak, and doesn\'t have any normal means to prosecute what you\'ve just described. It\'s not because of lacking some weirdly existential ""title"". By any normal customary use of land, each shack has a ""curtilage"" which extends the zone of dominion from the structure etc.  You\'re telling me that free concerts when people put down their blankets, it\'s normal to edge my space right up to yours and intrude on your enjoyment. It\'s definitely NOT normal, and concertgoers tend to complain to each other if somebody was parked too close.   If we live in a culture that\'s founded on disrespect and nobody cares, then it might look like a third world slum. You need a magical fetish to ""make"" it be title, even though all titles derive from possession at some point.    There\'s rowhouses and apartment dwellings in every modern city, but I doubt you\'d question the title of real estate in that instance.   That is completely wrong, people are not assigned the existential ownership of land in any case. You believe in a false god here, called ""deed trespassing"". All trespass consists of invading actual space or constructively belonging to another. The development of slums in the third world is happening according to the customary standard of that area, and it would be the same if legal title was recognized to build row houses and condos. Everything would touch, and get built right on top of each other like in every other Urban environment.   Notice you cannot define that property, which doesn\'t appear to be private either. I\'m talking about constant sales of land, which results in the development of vacant areas or their reversion to public use. All titles are subject to all other claims anyway, so it\'s just a method of selling off the public domain.  That\'s how tax sales work, there\'s no guarantee that deed has any efficacy or merchantability for any purpose. It\'s just selling off the potential of state dominion, and then you have to work it out in the Civil environment. The land described may not even exist, and this is publicly disclaimed by every tax authority.   Of course they do, it\'s all context to the environment.']"

Suddenly ""fair share"" means whatever the hell you feel like.   I find this statement to be incredibly ironic and hypocritical.

I\'m not and haven\'t been impressed with Mr. Trump\'s moving goalposts about it, avoidance, lying, and obfuscation. I\'m not saddened that his privacy in this was decided to be of less interest than disclosure of it. But, I\'d be of that opinion for any high ranking elected official. My only disappointment will be that the Ways and Means Committee is unlikely to make significant changes in the laws we have. Maybe tighten control over Presidents being audited in office every year--which Mr. Trump seems to have either avoided or mysteriously (or just weirdly luckily) been exempted from.

Of why such an identity to ""woman"" exists for *anyone*. I\'m talking about gender identity as a whole, not just it being practiced by transgender people. ""Cisgender"" is just as confusing. Those struggling to accept this transgender ""movement"" isn\'t due to the ""misallignment"" it\'s due to the attempts to *replace* a societal and personal understanding to such concepts around sex with one relating to a concept of gender identity that most people don\'t understand.   It\'s not that they want ""cismen"" to use the bathroom together whike rejecting transgender people, it\'s that they want *males* to use such together. Where personal identity isn\'t being recognized for *anyone*. That such social spaces aren\'t to be defined by subjective personal identity because the allowance of such destroys any measure of a shared collective. What aspect of ""woman"" are people identifying to when there exists the allowance that it can be for any reason? What can ""woman"" represent or convey to another when their exists no shared definition?  Look up the identity theory of Autism. It describes the distinction in perspective. There exists those more so on the autism spectrum to define their identity at the personal level. Whereas defining such socially, is the much more widespread ""norm"". That the perspective of others does have a fundemental influence on how others will identify you. And thus how you should identify yourself in the context of societal language. That first person authority doesn\'t extend to establish a type of authority over the identity toward social terms as such is to be recognized by others. You can percieve yourself as nice. You don\'t have the authority to dictate that others perceive tou as nice. Because such a condition is fundementally a societal concept. You\'re really only ""nice"" if others perceive such about you.    None of this is identity. These are fundebtal physical steps taken as an attempt to comply within the framework of sex. An attempt to change sex. That\'s distinct from the attempt to replace gender identity with sex. And many transgender people doesn\'t suffer gender dysphoria. Many don\'t wish to physically transition. Gender identity is a distinct concept from sex based physical changes.   What you bring up **is** a very interesting debate of where we are to draw the line *on* **sex**. But that\'s not the current conversation. The current conversation is presented as that any individual gets to determine their association to group classifications for their own reasons. That this ""identity"" has no shared concepts as to present forth a medium of understanding.   A ""line"" can be debated. But this debate is being disregarded in place of claiming no line can exist. That these concepts apparently are to stand, and be fundemental aspects of one\'s identity, but asking what such actually means is viewed as offensive. That any desire to understand why one concept is distinct from another is transphobic. Because it\'s fundementally a personal choice **not** to be socially understood. That one is free to associate to a group label without any influence upon the collective. Which is something many are perceiving as illogical. These social classifications are inherently social. That\'s the disagreement.', 'And what the programmers tell it to say. Because no AI routinely spits out the exact same answer, verbatim, multiple times. Yet ChatGPT has the exact answer to any [leading] question about transgender people being their biological sex.   ‚ÄúIt is not accurate or respectful to say that transgender women are ""____."" Doing so suggests that a person\'s gender identity is defined solely by their biological sex, which is not true.  Gender identity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person\'s identity that is separate from biological sex. It is the gender that a person feels most closely aligned with and identifies as. For some people, this may be the same as the sex they were assigned at birth, but for others, it may be different.  It is important to recognize and respect the gender identity of all individuals, including transgender people. This means acknowledging and using the name, pronouns, and other forms of self-expression that are most appropriate and meaningful to them.  In general, it is important to be mindful of the language and terminology that you use when discussing issues related to gender and identity. Using inclusive and respectful language can help to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all people, regardless of their gender identity.   That‚Äôs very clearly a designed response.', ""Part 2:  &amp;#x200B;   1.) It's not just the aspects of gender than specifically treat men better than women that are the problem, but aspects of gender that are just differences, without one group being treated better. When you take that view, everyone is part of the problem. You call people by different words depending on if you view them as men or women, so you're part of the problem to. You probably also interact slightly differently with men and women in other ways. But it is empirically true that many people who use different pronouns for men and women are willing to use pronouns that align with someone's identity.  Importantly for trans people, it is very stigmatised for a woman to get a phalloplasty. But though surgeons commonly won't let women get phalloplasties, they generally will let trans men get them. That is a way that men and women are treated differently where making one's identity clear clearly can change how you are treated (i.e. if you are allowed to get the surgery that will make you feel comfortable with your body). So people who reinforce gender will sometimes listen, and how someone identifies can make an important difference to how they are treated (I have gone for the low-hanging fruit here, but this applies much more broadly).  2.) Regarding someone who identifies as a man as a man is enforcing gender. But so is regarding someone who identifies as a man as a woman. People are going to enforce gender just as much either way, so given that, they should be encouraged to at least enforce a different gender where that would greatly reduce misery. And that doesn't at all prevent also encouraging people to treat people the same regardless of gender. In fact, I think particularly with trans people that aren't close to passing, where it takes a conscious effort to get their gender right, this can make people see how pervasive and arbitrary gender norms are. This helps move in the direction of gender abolition. More broadly, if trans people were widely accepted, the patriarchal justifications for gender roles, which are usually based in biology, would completely fall apart.  &amp;#x200B;   In the same way, the goal is to twist women (my categorisation) into submission. Though this is probably where personifying the patriarchy is more confusing than helpful. There isn't some group of men planning how to oppress women, so there isn't a goal in the literal sense. The 'goal' is the social function it performs for the patriarchy. And the function it performs is to twist women, both trans and cis, to serve men.  It also twists trans men to serve men as women, to the extent that it gets them to perform the role of 'woman' before transitioning (and to the extent that those behavious may linger after transitioning). If anything, it twists trans women more than cis women, as trans women tend to be more harshly sanctioned for not performing femininity. I agree that gender abolition should be the ultimate goal. And I agree that we need to try to reduce how much people are treated differently according to gender here and now. But that doesn't mean we can't also let people move between those gender roles where it will make them less miserable. If you already treated men and women exactly the same, this would require absolutely nothing of you.  &amp;#x200B;   Human sex is bimodally distributed. There are not many people inbetween the two main clusters, but there are some. As such, it makes sense to take that bimodal distribution into accoutn when designing society. But if you design things in a way that excludes people in the middle, you are reinforcing that distinction.  If you have a dating app where people attracted to men select the male sex, the people selecting that will be people attracted to male sexual characteristics. As such, cis men that happen not to fit well with those characteristics (and there will always be some) will not have much success on such an app. As such, men on that app are incentivised to try to make themselves more typically male. E.g. by not shaving or by working out in ways that make their body type more typically male. As such, this app ends up encouraging men to fit themselves into a male ideal- which is recreating a rudimentary form of gender. The same applies to women of course.  &amp;#x200B;  But also, I worry that the conversation is drifting again. How people are treated in a gendered way is a very different question from how people *should* be treated in a gendered way.

I believe the operation ""warp speed"" was to move faster than the machine in getting ahead of the information to cast doubt. The only thing that protects you and me is our ability to decide for yourself, ultimately it was your own decision in the face of adversity to deny it. Trump doesn\'t strongly promote the vaccine should have been your first step, the fact he was trying to get Ivermectin or any other alternative was quashed.  What more can ONE man do? He has a whole lot of other agendas he has to focus on, the deep state has many heads. So when the Fauci head was right next to him, he is basically saying ""I followed my head of medicine, and he led me astray, who was he really working for?"" Who could fault him? He\'s right Fauci was the figurehead of the Covid movement, he spearheaded it, Trump is just a president, not a doctor or chemist. He relies on intelligence given to him by... the FBI.   He was dealt a shitty hand and what he did was play some weak cards so he can hold the better hand down the road. He was never getting out of office unscathed and had to get dirty in some regards, but it\'s clear to anyone who liked Trump to know the difference between a very excited enthusiastic Trump vs a forced enthusiasm Trump.   He had to tow the line, but saying ""he\'s one of them"" doesn\'t accurately depict that. Remember his message when he said he was going to go against some ""really powerful enemies"" when he was going after big pharma? It wasn\'t a ""huge"" announcement but it was essentially saying ""I\'m onto these guys"" and ever since he has been public enemy number one. Coincidence? Why would he purposely choose to fall on his sword with operation warp speed? The above is the most common sense of anyone would do if they were put in the precise situation he was in. It was an impossible situation.   Damned if he did, damned if he didn\'t. You know how it would have played out if he chose to do nothing.

We have literally seen the entire earth. What new evidence do you imagine that could overturn the conclusion that the earth is an oblate spheroid? You really need to read this: https://hermiene.net/essays-trans/relativity_of_wrong.html   [facepalm]  Did you even bother to read my earlier comments? I explained this in detail. I\'ll explain again, with even smaller words:  Evolution as a phenomena is the observed fact that populations change over time. We know this happens because we have observed it on every level.   Evolution as a theory is the explanation for WHY evolution as a phenomena occurs.   Evolution as a phenomena is a fact.   Evolution as a theory is not a fact.   Evolutions as a theory is extremely well supported by overwhelming evidence, but science will never, ever conclude that evolution is ""the truth"" because science does not address the truth when it comes to explanations. There always could be some new piece of evidence that is  discovered that shows a flaw in the theory.   It\'s also worth noting that you are completely wrong when you suggest that evolution could be ""refuted"". It can\'t. At least not in a meaningful sense.  The evidence that the theory of evolution is correct is overwhelming, and comes from many diverse fields of science. No single new discovery could ever show that ToE is totally false. In order to do that, you would need to find hundreds or thousands of new pieces of evidence, all of which are completely incompatible with the existing explanation. That won\'t happen. We haven\'t found a single piece of such evidence since Darwin\'s days, so it is simply unreasonable to believe that we will suddenly start finding mountains of it now.  What could happen, and happens all the time, is that new evidence could be found that causes us to slightly reformulate our current theory. Unlike religion, science has no issue with this. It is literally the core of science: You adapt your understandings to account for new evidence as it becomes available.    The ToE we have today is not the ToE that Darwin came up with. It is not even the same ToE that we had a year ago.   But what we know today is based on the theory Darwin formulated, updated to account for all the new things we have discovered over the last 175 years or so.', 'Evolution is just the change in allele frequencies in a population over time. We observe that constantly. Even AIG themselves acknowledge that that is a real thing. It is unquestionably a fact.  It is not a fact that ""the theory of evolution via natural selection as proposed by Darwin and modified by further research by countless scientists is true.""   In other words, when we say ""evolution is a fact"", we are talking about the phenomena of evolution, not the theory that science has shown best explains the phenomena.   We make this point because a small subset of creationists so are fundamentally misinformed that they deny that evolution occurs *at all,* despite it being extremely well documented.   [I linked to an article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_as_fact_and_theory) that goes deeper into why evolution is both a fact and a theory, but it is absolutely true that it is both.', 'You can also say that the theory is factual, in the colloquial sense, being as observed evolution happens as the theory suggests it should. The theory is built from facts and it has led to many confirmed predictions and it‚Äôs about as close to a factually accurate description of biological evolution and how it works.   In science ‚Äúfact‚Äù is more like a verified/demonstrated/observed data point but that doesn‚Äôt mean that theories aren‚Äôt all pretty much all factual to some degree. It‚Äôs a fact that evolution happens pretty much as the theory says it happens and not just that evolution happens at all.   Creationists have very little trouble accepting that evolution happens at all. It‚Äôs the explanation for how evolution happens, the evolutionary history or life, the concept of universal common ancestry, and how this *could* be extended to include a large portion of what we call ‚Äúabiogenesis‚Äù considering how autocatalytic RNA molecules evolve and form spontaneously via ordinary physics and chemistry. The problem is when God is taken out of the equation. That‚Äôs why they treat science like it‚Äôs an atheist cult that a lot of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Taoists, etc. participate in. I‚Äôve even had people tell me that science is just one giant conspiracy that the people trying to prove each other wrong don‚Äôt realize they are propagating.   It‚Äôs a fact that the theory of biological evolution is pretty damn factual. It‚Äôs also a fact that populations change. Creationists object to the first but they can‚Äôt hide from the second. It‚Äôs too obvious.  **Edit:** In terms of calling the theory ‚Äúfactual‚Äù I should reiterate this by stating that the theory describes how evolution happens and then when we watch evolution happen it‚Äôs the same as the theory describes. There may be some nuance or you could hypothetically say that there‚Äôs a god toying with us by creating things that only match our expectations when it comes to what we didn‚Äôt watch evolve. You could say we‚Äôve been implanted with false memories when it comes to what we‚Äôve observed.   You can make up all sorts of unfounded assumptions about what might really be going on that we only mistake as the theory providing an actual factual description of evolution, but outside of these unfounded assumptions you‚Äôll see a one to one correlation between what the theory says happens and what observe happening. There‚Äôs always room for improvement and there‚Äôs always the hypothetical chance we‚Äôre wrong, but I had a rather drawn out discussion about how we can‚Äôt consider theories factual because that implies that we already found the absolute truth, or something along those lines.   To be clear, this was never my intention. The theory of evolution is one of the best supported theories in science. It‚Äôs the most hated by fundamentalists. It‚Äôs withstood over a century of scrutiny. It holds up. What it describes is what we see. It‚Äôs like the germ theory of disease, oxygen theory, or the the theory about the shape of our planet. It‚Äôll always be the provisional truth just in case we‚Äôre wrong, but at this point in time there‚Äôs no reason to consider it a false explanation for how evolution occurs. It seems pretty accurate. As far as we can tell it provides a factual explanation. As such, it‚Äôs not too absurd to treat it as such.']"

All these studies that show it prevents implantation do so without comparing outcomes, we see just as many pregnancies as we would expect from ovulation without the contraceptive, so while there may be other mechanisms at play in vivo we can eliminate prevention of implantation (and thus any abortifacient properties it may have).     Noe directly addresses this in my link:  * As we noted in the introduction of our paper, the action of LNG-EC on endometrial histology and function has been widely investigated [9,10]. One recent study demonstrates no effect of LNG on human implantation in vitro.  * As indicated, the direct effect of LNG-EC on fertilization cannot be investigated in vivo in humans. Hence, the ratio observed/expected pregnancies has become the acknowledged means to estimate the efficacy of LNG-EC.

In rural Texas there are rural areas that go 90-95% R, whereas in Wisconsin they mostly go 50-70% R, giving us a chance there. In so many states if rural voters voted like in Texas we‚Äôd be screwed, so stopping the bleeding is important.', 'It\'s not just about *winning* the rural vote - that\'s not realistic - it\'s about at least avoiding catastrophic declines among them  It can make a big difference if Dems lose rural areas by 40 points vs by 50 points, for example. And it\'s important to remember it can be easier to lose voters than to gain them, so when it comes to the idea of ""saying fuck it to rural areas and focusing on suburbs"" for example, the suburbs are trending D but only very slowly. Comparing 2012 and 2020 (a relatively easy comparison since the Dems won the popular vote by around the same nationally in both years) Dems lost the suburbs by 2 points (48-50) in 2012 and won them by  2 (50-48) in 2020. That\'s a definite shift... but it only allowed the Dems to basically maintain the same popular vote nationally, with worse electoral college performance. And it doesn\'t seem realistic to expect the suburbs to suddenly start going to the Dems way faster than they are (that\'s not to say the suburbs shouldn\'t be part of the D strategy - I\'d still say they should be a centerpiece of it, even) while if the Dems just give up on the rural areas, the rural decline on the other hand could accelerate even more  Plus a total surrender in rural areas could harm suburban appeal too. Some suburbanites could have some affinity for rural areas - some more than others, for example the suburbanites who love to fly confederate flags even though they are in fucking New Hampshire or whatever are likely not winnable for the Dems, but you can have less solidly right wing suburbanites too who still have some sympathy for the vague idea of rural areas and aren\'t going to blindly follow rural political trends but also would be turned off by a democratic party that just fully gave up on rural appeal', ""No, that's pretty clearly not my point.  I'm saying there's nothing about the Electoral College that systematically favors rural voters. Because almost every state is winner-take-all, it just rewards the candidates who distribute their votes efficiently -- winning enough states narrowly. So the candidates focus all their attention on the handful of swing states. Those states have urban areas and rural areas. So there's nothing about the Electoral College that necessarily ensures rural voters get a say. In a popular vote system, rural voters would get a say -- in fact, each vote would be exactly equal.""]"

Puberty-blockers don't led to  a child accepting themselves, it alters their body. That's like giving a suicidal person medication to kill themselves.  How do I know? I know because gender dysphoria has never been an issue among teen girls before. Even when we had such a diagnosis, it was mostly little boys, and transvestite adult men, not teen girls. Also, deleting important words from a quote kind of defeats the purpose of using the quote feature, doesn't it?  'serious reason, multiple years of counseling, and a professional diagnosis.'  That's simply false. In 2012, WPATH altered its standards to permit even minors to receive hormone treatment on the basis of ‚Äúinformed consent, meaning that neither diagnosis of gender dysphoria nor therapist's note would be required.  &amp;#x200B;  I already confronted the idea that increased transgender identification is purely because of societal acceptance. I'll summarize. If trans kids who aren't accepted kill themselves, and high percentages of the human population have always been trans, where are the suicides?  'Asking for a statistic that hasn‚Äôt been tracked until recently is reductionist thinking.'Suicide statistics? Im not talking about trans suicide specifically. Just suicide in general.'Going back even further, it was not uncommon for people to dress in extravagant or ‚Äúgirly‚Äù clothing.'If you're referring to the idea of 'gender-diverse' ancient civilizations, most examples used are not actual examples of expressing one's gender identity.

Perceived self is practically interchangeable with mental identity. But someone can have a false mental identity. Because the perception of themself(aka identity) that they store in their mind(mentally) is not in keeping with reality.  No one profits off of trans kids? How about the plastic surgeons who make tens of thousands for the surgeries? How about the pharmaceutical companies that produce drugs like Lupron? They make millions. Video from Vanderbilt university shows the directors openly discussing how profitable sex change operations are.  'Which is why no one is suggesting permanent transitions for minors.'  This is simply false, on many levels. 1- puberty blockers and cross sex hormones often have irreversible physical effects. the extent of these effects is not known, and neither are potential long term effects, and won't be known until this generation of lab rats grows up. 2-Giving these kids these medications/ socially transitioning them puts them on track for surgeries later. Many kids experience periods of gender confusion and can easily grow out of it; it's much harder to lead a normal life after everyone pretends you're the opposite sex for a year. 3- Minors **do** receive sex-change surgeries. It is a fact that teen girls under 18 can and do receive double mastectomies. Not just 17-year-olds, but 13-year-olds. Maybe younger, although 13 is the youngest confirmed. These are irreversible.  Trans kids are not normal. No society has celebrated children rejecting their bodies, allowed doctors to drug and mutilate them, and pretended it's a legitimate, helpful practice."", "" Literally millions of suicides throughout human history.  Your premise is kind of silly to begin with, that somehow because a small portion of the population is trans and that portion of the population has a higher rate of suicide that we'd suddenly be innundated with trans suicide notes.  If you have 1000 people and 5 of them are trans and 2 of them commit suicide and 1 of them writes a note then you have 40 other suicides in the rest of that 1000 person population you've got one note about trans suicide in a pile of 50 others which is pretty much exactly what we see.  Trans people are an incredibly small portion of the population and a small (but larger than other demographics) fraction of them are suicidal and an even smaller portion of them actually commit suicide and an even *smaller* number of those people actually write a note and finally a small portion of those notes actually explains why they killed themselves.   There were just shy of 48,000 suicides last year and trans people make up around 0.5% of the population, which means we would expect to see around 250 trans suicides in a nation of 330 million people.

Border cities like El Paso will have their local social services overwhelmed. The (Democratic) mayor of El Paso has declared a state of emergency already in anticipation of the surge.  I'm in favor of more open immigration and think title 42 has been abused for far too long already, but we also really need to do more to support immigration enforcement at the border. Immigration is the purview of the federal government. Local border cities like El Paso shouldn't have to bear the brunt of an influx of migrants that overwhelms local services and be forced into drastic measures to ensure migrants don't freeze on the streets."", "" 'Stop lying', he says, while confidently asserting that NY is in fact asking for $3B to deal with migrants, not the...$3B I stated.  You keep using that word, lying - I'm not sure it means what you think it means, bud.    I know, that's exactly my point. Migrants? That's for those darn Texans to deal with. What!? How dare you send migrants up here?!? We don't deal with refugees, that's *your* job! Help, emergency!  Virtue signalling is cheap when it's on someone else's dime, but that is 99% of the Dem platform.    Boo hoo. Texas deals with 3 million a year - 1/100th that number sending NYC crying and screaming to the feds over an emergency that needs billions to fix just shows you how comfortable you libs got in leaving migrants to Texas to handle. Too bad that grift's ending.    'Let them all in' is not taking border security seriously - no wonder Republicans aren't signing on for that nonsense.   Title 42 staunched a tidal wave that is now descending on Texas - it is the quickest, best solution to the problem, pending the Dems getting their heads out of their asses. Much like the Migrant Protection Protocols, which are another tool for the problem the Dems are trying to kill.    Had zero warning. I still don't think you or any of the other virtue-signalling Dems get just how bad this wave is. FY 2021-2022 saw 2.76 million border crossings in Texas, a record high that was *1 million above* 2020-2021, which in itself was a record high. Border crossings have skyrocketed since Biden took office to levels Texas could not anticipate or deal with. It has spent $4B of Texans' money to try to do the feds job in containing this gigantic influx (not counting the additional billions spent to feed, house and clothe migrants) but there are limits to its patience.   Good, so DC and NY should shut the fuck up then. Deal with these problems you didn't ask for.   The crisis has nothing to do with incompetence or Texas - as I said to someone else, if you let Texas handle border security, they wouldn't complain, but you probably wouldn't like the result. The problem is that you libs expect Texas to deal with your mess in terms of the migrants you encourage to hop the border into the United States through wilfully ending Title 42, ending the MSPs, and virtue signalling about illegal migration. On Texas' dime, at the cost of Texas' overloaded social services and infrastructure.  Texas has decided to export your hobby horses directly to you. Not even all of them, just a tiny number that willingly choose to go to DC/NYC. And for this tiny number, you folks cry, wail, mald and seethe.  Good. Finally you're listening."", "" Yeah, I know - this entire thread is you seeing exactly what you want to see, no more. You don't see the tens of thousands of migrants Texas houses in one of the nation's largest shelter networks, the desperate appeals by everyone from mayors to state legislators to Abbott himself for help, the pleas by Texas to stop encouraging migrants to cross for years now.  Texas is full. 53,000 migrants arrived at El Paso alone in October, 2.4 million across the border this year. When Title 42 ends,  hundreds of thousands will arrive without fear of deportation, monthly.  Texas deals with shit you hypocrites can't even imagine. 17,000 people arrived over a year in NYC and Adams declares an emergency and screams for federal funding. Texas sees 100 times that every year, and has been asking for help for years - but you people prefer virtue-signalling, and you in particular prefer to ignore everything Texas is saying because truth be told, pointing out that you and your side are shameless hypocrites is painful to hear.   Well, you want open borders, you got them. Here's just a couple hundred people who willingly choose to get on a bus to DC - and rich libs have a meltdown screaming about Texas not showing any empathy and compassion.  What you mean by ' empathy and compassion' is 'deal with this shit so I don't have to'. Sorry bud - time to live what you demand Texas submits to. Share the burden, it's Christmas after all - all Texas is doing is pointing it out to you, and in the process not letting migrants freeze. 'Cynical political stunt'?

[One from Cornell Law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/gross_negligence#): ""Gross negligence is a lack of care that demonstrates reckless disregard for the safety or lives of others, which is so great it appears to be a conscious violation of other people\'s rights to safety. Gross negligence is a heightened degree of negligence representing an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of care. Falling between intent to do wrongful harm and ordinary negligence, gross negligence is defined as willful, wanton, and reckless conduct affecting the life or property or another.   Gross negligence is considered more harmful than ordinary negligence because it implies a thoughtless disregard of the consequences and the failure to use even slight care to avoid harming the life or property of another.""  And one from a [Law office](https://www.freemaninjurylaw.com/blog/difference-between-negligence-gross-negligence/): ""Gross negligence is the extreme indifference to or reckless disregard for the safety of others. Gross negligence is more than simple carelessness or failure to act‚Äîit is willful behavior done with extreme disregard for the health and safety of others.  Examples of gross negligence include:  1. A driver speeding in an area with heavy pedestrian traffic; 2. A doctor prescribing a patient a drug that their medical records clearly list that they are allergic to; or 3. Nursing home staff failing to provide water or food to a resident for several days.""

It will warm more slowly, but will continue warming.  To stop warming, we need to get to net zero emissions.  If you believe the potential of carbon sinks is limited and don't want geoengineering, then we need to get to almost zero emissions across the board. No matter where they are.  A [majority of carbon emissions comes from outside the West](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/no-the-us-didnt-outsource-our-carbon), in countries with much lower incomes. If you look at [clean cooking on Project Drawdown's Table of Solutions](https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions), it is #8 or #6 on the list of greatest emissions reduction needs.  Physics does not care about moral fairness. To stop warming, all of these emissions sources need to go to near-zero. Or, we invest in geoengineering and carbon sinks as a backup.  The best way to encourage these countries (many of which are not democracies, and most of whom very much do not like the low-consumption lifestyle they currently have) to reduce emissions is to make green technology the best way to grow. [Many developed countries are already decoupling economic growth from emissions](https://i.redd.it/eqvs995dt8x91.jpg). If we can continue this trend, we have a solid shot at convincing the world to achieve our climate targets. If not, geoengineering could be a reasonable goal."", ""I'm aware of carbon capture. I mentioned it in my previous comment. My understanding is this is unlikely to scale up to offset a really large fraction of emissions.  Please stop strawmanning me, I strongly support smaller homes and I do not like cars. But a reduction in home size and car use alone does not eliminate emissions from construction and transportation, much less other sources of emissions like heating. Many of these solutions will require innovation and massive investment."", 'Don\'t get me wrong, I think emissions reduction should be our Plan A. But there\'s a meme that all we have to do to solve climate change is get rid of frivolous consumerism, and that is incredibly wrong.  A lot of carbon emissions comes from necessities, and net-zero means we need to remove almost all emissions. Heating and cooling homes, at least some amount, is a necessity. Making stuff with plastics but also cement, steel, aluminum, glass, and other reusable materials also emits carbon. For many, driving is unfortunately a necessity. For most Redditors including myself, having a powerful computer and reliable electricity is a necessity. All of these activities emit carbon and these will need to be decarbonized.  As a case study, one of the biggest emissions reduction needs comes from clean cookstoves. These are lower-income people in developing countries cooking with traditional methods which often emit through burning non-renewable biomass. Unfortunately, net-zero means these activities will also need to be decarbonized. It\'s not fair, but that\'s physics. This process requires developing affordable and quality clean cookstoves that can replace traditional cooking methods. Otherwise, people will use their traditional methods even when given a clean cookstove (""stove stacking""). Emissions are not a moral failing from excess consumption, but is currently a byproduct of our daily necessities.  It will take more innovation and innovation to decarbonize the economy. We haven\'t figured out all of the challenges yet. I strongly support massive funding for innovation and implementation of green technologies.  But if you really believe climate change is horrible, and there is a chance that some of the innovation and implementation might not happen fast enough, why rule out geoengineering?

Malign deflation is a symptom of an economy that's doing poorly and is NOT a good thing. This type of deflation has caused Japan in particular serious problems. Yay, low prices... Until you realise that due to the economic slowdown caused, you have a Lower wage, unemployment and other problems. Prices lowering also causes drops in spending, why buy something for 5$ when it could be 4$ next week? During times of economic uncertainty and poor confidence, why would people spend and invest more seeing as this type of deflation as I've said is the result of an economy doing badly.   Benign deflation however is regarded by virtually everyone as positive. Its a drop in prices caused by competition, improvements in productivity, innovation and new capital improvements etc etc. Nobody is against this sort.  I think you should read more about deflation and the effects it had on the Japanese economy before accusing everyone who is against deflation as 'parroting propaganda'."", ""Oh man. You really arent familiar with economics are you? You DON'T GET MALIGN DEFLATION WITHOUT UNEMPLOYMENT AS WELL.  I literally feel like a broken record, so I will explain it for you as simply as possible as I'm guessing youve never studied economics before.  You cannot get deflation just happening by magic. It is a result of *something* happening in the economy.  Now, benign deflation you can think of as good deflation. This is due to business improvements and investment, lower prices as the cost of production is lowered. This is great for business and consumers alike.  However, not all deflation is benign. We also have malign deflation, known as Bad deflation. This happens as a result of sudden demand shock, caused by unemployment for example. This is why I have mentioned it. Therefore, you'd suffer the effects of this unemployment also along with this deflation, which is why it is considered to be BAD.  Therefore straight up saying deflation is good or bad depends on whether it is malign or benign. You cannot group all deflation under one heading. You saying deflation isn't bad is a ignorant statement, you must understand the different types before you can say it is good or bad. Unemployment has everything to do with deflation as if thats what's caused it, then it's bad.""]"

It would not be fine for a gay kindergarten teacher to say ""some boys are sexually attracted to girls and some boys are sexually attracted to boys"" - it is precisely the sexual aspect that is banned, because that is the aspect that isn\'t age appropriate.

""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age accordance with state standards""  That\'s all it says.   Keep in mind that these are kids aged 5 to 8. There is no appropriate way to have a conversation with a child about sexual orientation when they don\'t even know what sex is. In the 3rd grade, kids are mastering how to make change from a dollar and how to read a map, if that helps contextualize the age group. Conservatives aren\'t doing a bait and switch about sex and sexual orientation, its just that talking to an eight year old about sexual orientation _really is that creepy_. Google image search ""8 year olds"" then imagine going up to one of them in public and telling them you\'re gay. Or straight for that matter. Its super creepy. It shouldn\'t come up.

If it did come up and the adult brought it up, I\'d want them investigated for grooming. If the kid brought it up, I\'d want them investigated for potential abuse.

One actually does harm to the child, the other protects a child from harm. And teachers have an *obligation* to teach things that may contradict the religion of student‚Äôs parents.

It‚Äôs absolutely not the same thing. A kid wanting to keep things from their parents isn‚Äôt inherently a problem unless what they‚Äôre keeping from their parents is abuse.

Followed by Nixon, who, not being able to outflank George Wallace's social conservatism/racism, and not alienate the other half of the country, split the South with Wallace. With Wallace out of the picture in 72, Nixon dominated the South.   But in 76, it was a - seemingly - authentic good ol' baptist, Southern Democrat, versus an Ivy league Northern moderate - ostensibly a legacy Republican. One that refused to deploy the Southern Strategy, and thus lost handily to the true, blue Southerner. Of course, once Carter got in office, he governed as a social liberal, and the South, having learned its lesson about idpol - at least for 16 years, kicked him to the curb in favor of the California actor, who opposed the CRA and VRA, and lauded Jefferson Davis.""]"

You realize how many primate species exist? There used to be about that many Coelacanth species. What‚Äôs left of the Coelacanths are just two species that did not yet exist 66 million years ago. People thought the **entire order** had gone extinct, but nope, in the 1930s they found one of the two or three species still barely clinging to an existence.  There also wasn‚Äôt a reboot. There wasn‚Äôt a global flood. The last major extinction event was caused by a combination of volcanic eruptions, meteor impacts, and the resulting ‚Äúwinter‚Äù as the sunlight was blocked for awhile by all of the ash, platinum, iridium, and palladium falling from the sky. These last three are very rare on our planet but they are very common in meteors and there‚Äôs a layer of that stuff right at the KT extinction boundary. It wasn‚Äôt a reboot way back then either. That‚Äôs when the non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, most of the large marine reptiles, and pretty much anything that couldn‚Äôt survive a couple days without food, burrow underground, or fly away went extinct. Some of the stuff in the oceans survived because it was less brutal and because a lot of that stuff like jellyfish wouldn‚Äôt choke on the ashes.   The biggest extinction event was before that one and it wasn‚Äôt caused by a global flood either. It wiped out about 90% of animal life and 60% of plant life or something around there and before that extinction event there were a lot of species of trilobites, a bunch of synapsids with the large ‚Äúsail‚Äù on their back for temperature regulation or whatever, and whole lot of other things that were extinct before the existence of the first mammals or the first dinosaurs. This one happened way back when all the continents were still connected and it‚Äôs apparently connected to some massive volcanic activity and global warming as the frozen methane under the ocean had melted and caused a runaway warming effect. That methane is also toxic in high quantities, especially for animals that would prefer to breath oxygen instead. That one marks the start of the Mesozoic and the last big one that has ended marks the end of the Mesozoic.   They thought the entire order of Coelacanths had went extinct with the non-avian dinosaurs but just like we still have 10,000 species of bird we still have 2 or 3 species of coelacanth. There used to be a lot of other dinosaurs and there used to a lot of other coelacanths. What survived diversified but the coelacanths we still have are barely holding on.

But i didn\'t react to them. At all. I assumed your interpretation as ""worst case scenario"" was true. Again, I steel manned your position so we could focus on your methodology and fundamental premise. I do not need to know your interpretation is correct to accomplish this. We may disagree on your ""WCS"" interpretation and agree WCS happen even with the best of intentions, data, foresight, planning, etc to avoid them. It\'s also not possible to predict a WCS in some instances and you simply have to deal with unpredictabile outcomes sometimes.   Again, let\'s discuss methodology first.   Logical and reasonably creating policy/laws/etc that define how guide human interaction should occur die not begin with ""avoid Z outcome"" first. It\'s ""Address issue X by creating a framework that does that as much as possible while allowing provisions to prevent undesirable outcomes"".  You seem very intent on just reacting to undesirable outcomes to three point you are accusing me of ignoring them. Again, I\'m literally operating on your interpretation right now and telling you ""Create provision Y to prevent outcome Z"" is that step and I\'ve actually said it twice now, at least twice, and inferred to it on top of that as well.   Again, you are working backwards from your conclusion and now you have attached a political label/narrative when it was not even necessary and you are making accusations now that the ""issue"" your bright to up is being ignored. You\'ve left no room that your interpretation might actually be biased and incorrect despite my willingness to work with you and assume the opposite is true for the sake of argument.  Do we at least agree on methodology? Yes or no?   Again, it needs to be demonstrated Z is bad, and that the stewards are ignoring it. I\'m going to keep saying it. Focus on methodology first   So now the claim becomes ""the policy is the real issue"". Again this needs to be demonstrated as well and in addition and again. If the policy overwhelming has a positive and desired affect, it\'s not an inherently bad policy. This is again the second time I\'ve described this.  Pronoun policies have a net benefit effect. Everyone (or at least nearly/most people) has preferred pronouns and using them makes them feel like they are being respected at a fundamental level. It\'s literally provable that constantly referring to someone in a way they find off-putting or offensive, leads to negative health outcomes. This is fundamental to understanding how even something as basic as bullying or insults work. Ultimately, with time and repetition, you\'ve affected that person\'s well-being negatively. Incorrect pronouns, as an example, affect everyone in this argument the same way. Cisgender people are not immune and it is demonstrable people will call men femme pronouns and vice vera both with the intent to harm as well as just by mistake.  Again pronoun policies exist for the benefit of society and are proven to prevent harm and negative health outcomes, especially in the case of trans youth, and that\'s not debatable. It\'s just factual.  Outcome Z, it\'s the outlier, as defined by the fact is rare and undesirable, regards of what specifically it is. You do not trash an inherently proven good policy merely just to prevent outcome Z. Again, this goes back to methodology and hopefully you agree because I\'m tired of dragging you back there.   Just going to ignore this paragraph because it\'s assuming  a ton and frankly, loaded with narrative/bias that would just take more paragraphs to break down. I\'m purposely avoiding your characterisations of Z and your reasoning because we haven\'t gotten to the point where we are actually discussing Z. I\'m even sure your think that link describes some kind of perceived hypocrisy or failure to recognize outcome Z is harmful and again we may agree. Let the conversation flow there naturally though and stop trying to force it.    Then you\'ve fundamentally disagreed with how we structure laws that govern our basic human and constitutional rights as well as allow us to live relatively peacefully while respecting our differences.  Societies, at least prosperous ones, operate on this principle. The idea is essential to a peaceful thriving human civilization. If you don\'t focus on the concept of a ""greater good"" that\'s objectively measured, you end up with a plethora of Z outcomes and social collapse/chaos.  This idea is even essential to the concept of a healthy Democracy at it\'s core.   The correct answer to this question is actually \'as few as possible with 0 being the goal"".   This comment will eventually run too long because of your lack of focus. Just warning you now I\'m not going to do a split reply. Focus if you want to continue and stop with these manipulations with a hyperfocus on Z to simply attack policy A. It\'s highly manipulative and again, working backward assuming your characterisation is the ""correct"" one.  You need to again, demonstrate that every step of the way and One addressed this again, multiple times. Anecdotal Z\'s don\'t make a policy automatically bad.  That\'s literally how being a reactionary works.   I\'m actually recognizing that in the real world, philosophy and reality are generally different. The constant improvements to work towards a goal is what a ""zero accidents"" philosophy actually is. A single accident doesn\'t negate or prove the policy is a terrible policy. Perhaps the policy was not just properly adhered to and the failure was simply a human one in a chain of humans.  You will never achieve that goal, ultimately being 0, if you\'re too busy attacking the policy that overwhelming leads to good outcomes because your interpretation of Z, correct or not, is your only focus. In the end, you do more harm than good.  Ok going in circles. I\'ve addressed the same thing over and over. Trim this down and focus on method or the essays are going to just get longer. Again if you want to discuss Z citations,  find a point of agreement first without the political meandering.  Edit: a sidenote on Zero Tolerance Policies. They are also shown to cause harm in certain situations, like bullying. Properly enforced, ZTP punishes the victim for reacting and even for physically defending themselves. ZTP in schools is frankly a bad idea. Apply this to restaurants and parties harassing other parties. At some point one has to acknowledge there is a victim and there is an instigator. When you empower the instigator, you just get more instigators instigating and eventually people don\'t want to eat at your establishment.']"

They‚Äôll blame Congress but won‚Äôt take any accountability for the fact that they openly support abortion bans and gerrymander the hell out of states like Texas, Florida, Ohio, etc to ensure that their anti-choice candidates win and get elected to Congress. Ohio Republicans are now even amending their own constitution in the state legislature so that if Ohio Democrats did ever take control of the legislature, that they would need a super majority of 60% or more to overturn their own total abortion ban. Further changing the laws to insulate policy that most Americans don‚Äôt want. They rig the system at the state and local level for their benefit while pushing the narrative that its Congress‚Äô fault, even when they‚Äôre the ones obstructing bills that over 2/3rds of Americans want. Whether its abortion rights, the right for same-sex/interracial marriages, healthcare, voting rights, etc.', "" Lol, nobody lost their abortion rights when Democrats were in charge of the relevant institutions. Texans didn't lose abortion rights under Ann Richards, and Americans didn't lose abortion rights when there was a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, either. I'm sorry you're confused, but it was ~~conservatives~~ reactionaries who did both of those things. All you're doing is shifting blame from Republicans, where it belongs, onto Democrats. It's called [Murc's Law](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=murc%27s%20law).   Codification isn't the answer people think it is. A Supreme Court that can overturn a half-century-old precedent can just as easily find a statute unconstitutional. It's what they did in *Shelby County*, it's what they did in *Brnovich*, and it's what they did in *Bruen*.  Americans didn't lose abortion rights because of anything Biden or Democrats did or didn't do. Democrats didn't legislate away anyone's abortion rights. Americans lost their abortion rights because RBG failed to timely retire, and because American voters failed in nearly a decade of elections, which allowed Republicans to take away abortion rights.  If they'd elected a Democratic Senate majority in 2014, which would've let Obama fill Scalia's seat, there would be no Gorsuch. That would've given us a 5-4 liberal majority. They failed again in 2016, electing Trump and a GOP Senate majority instead of Clinton and Democratic majorities, giving us Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. That gave us a 5-4 reactionary majority. Then they failed again in 2018, giving us Barrett, and a 6-3 reactionary majority. Then they did the absolute bare minimum in 2020, electing a razor-thin Democratic margin in the House, and a literal zero-seat margin in the Senate.  There was no reason to codify abortion rights prior to 2017, because any bill that could actually have passed would've offered weaker protections than Roe already provided. It would've been legislating *away* abortion rights! But, to the extent you think it would've been worthwhile (you're wrong), the last chance they had to do so was during the 111th Congress, the first half of Obama's first term. Was there any movement to codify abortion rights back then? No. For the 112th-116th Congresses, it was impossible, because voters made it impossible. And in the 117th Congress, it was theoretically possible, except, as you already pointed out, they don't have the votes to either overcome or abolish the filibuster. Because, again, voters did the bare minimum in 2020. So you claim they could've done it, but then admit they actually couldn't. And, again, it wouldn't actually do what you want it to do in the first place, even if they did have the votes for it. Which they don't.  Losing abortion rights was a forgone conclusion after 2016. It's just that it took another six years to find a case and for that case to work its way to to the Supreme Court. You don't protect abortion rights by sometimes electing Democrats and sometimes electing Republicans, and hoping Democrats can do enough while they're in power to prevent Republicans from undoing it when they're in power. That's not how it works! You protect abortion rights by electing Democrats, at every level of government, in every single election, so Republicans never have an opportunity to take those rights away in the first place. If we'd elected Democratic majorities in 2014, 2016, and 2018, and elected Clinton over Trump, Dobb wouldn't have even been heard in the Supreme Court, and *Roe* and *Casey* would still be good law.   It's called choosing your battles. There is a finite amount of time and resources, and there's an opportunity cost to pursuing a bill that's doomed to fail, in that it means those resources can't be used to pursue another bill that could actually pass instead.   Lol, what did which Republicans do when? Citations needed.   Prove it. Elect all Democrats, and see what happens. Take away all their excuses you think they use. Filibuster becomes irrelevant, parliamentarian becomes irrelevant, the VP breaking ties becomes irrelevant, absences and vacancies become irrelevant. Or hell, try even just electing filibuster- and veto-proof supermajorities in both houses of Congress. Then it won't even matter who wins the presidency, because they'll have the votes to override any President's veto."", 'I also genuinely think there might be a calculated effort among some State Republican Parties who notice the bad polling on their 6-week bans or total bans to basically quietly push or nudge State Supreme Courts to quietly overturn or put a permanent injunction on said 6-week bans or total bans. Pass a law to tell the base they want to ""protect life hur hur hur"" but pass such a flawed law by design so the Courts can pretty much kill it or put a permanent injunction on it.    Doing so this way allows the issue to be washed off the hands of Republicans without forcing Republicans in the legislature to vote for a looser and less restrictive abortion law. Honestly, it\'d be the smartest way to get rid of this very toxic and unpopular long-term issue since the burden can be placed on the Courts instead of any Republican legislature. None of these total abortion bans or 6-week bans are popular anywhere, even in deep-red Indiana.   We\'ll see what the court cases on Indiana\'s total ban (currently not in effect due to Court order), Ohio\'s 6-week ban (currently not in effect due to Court order), Georgia\'s 6-week ban comes to.  At the moment, I\'m just happy I live in a blue state that protects the right to choose. It does limit severely where I would consider moving to, but it is what it is.']"

Most highways are 70mph. I don\'t get what you\'re trying to argue here.   Again, completely wrong. The study showed that the average person goes a little over 65 in a 55 **interstate highway**, not 70.

I guess you can\'t find a source for it, unsurprisingly.  # The fact that people speed 11mph over the limit on one specific type of interstate highway does not in any way prove that it\'s SAFE to drive 10-15mph over on all roads.

On your average 55mph highway tho, it\'s definitely more dangerous to be going 80-85mph. On a 70mph highway, going 95-100mph is insane and reckless. I agree that some politicians need to hurry up on updating the speed limits on some rural intrastate highways, but saying that ""25-30mph over the limit"" is a safe rule of thumb is wrong and dangerous.

Again, it\'s wealth, more than education which directly impacts crime and criminality (I was talking specifically about commission of crimes rather than prevention through better enforcement, but of course you\'d be correct if you said that we can\'t know commission rates accurately without good enforcement, so it still seems to follow that wealth is the single biggest factor, since we would expect *more* crime to be reported among the wealthy, all else equal, yet we see less...and it probably way less, because it gets reported less among the poor).   I don\'t believe we have good evidence for that one way or another. I\'m sure it will be a mix.  But in any case, these are all motives which are most directly affected by wealth/poverty.  You can find the dumbest low-life out there, and they almost certainly at one point or another, regurgitated to themselves or others, the wisdom of not getting addicted to drugs, or not acting greedily or rashly, but to instead plan and work hard and save (and get educated) and move out of the hood or away from temptations.  They all *know* better (in fact I\'d argue that they know it better, and feel it more deeply, than any highly educated person who\'s never had to grow up in the hood or slums or favellas or whatever).   Sure...again, I might not be understanding you, but I think that they tend to focus more on policies which prioritize education than on wealth; and even when they focus on wealth its always only transfers or welfare...not ways to invigorate people\'s economic opportunities and engender the purpose and dignity and self-respect which tend to come with economic growth, especially building a career or a business.  Prioritizing education though does have a lot of other benefits for reducing crime; given the poor conditions that many kids find themselves in, just being in school instead of on the streets does alleviate a lot of opportunity for crime. So that\'s probably the most powerful mechanism for education to directly affect crime.   It depends what we mean by regulation. Government regulation and intervention occur in layers...there\'s always unintended consequences and failures and political externality which plague government action; from the very basic existence of the state which can be captured, to the highest level, esoteric financial regulations meant to tweak some tiny incentive among investment bankers; and while they are often a net-negative on the whole, they did mostly come about for ""good"" (read: expedient) reasons and so the second best option isn\'t just to deregulate the top few layers off...that will just expose people to the bad consequences which the higher layer of regulations had mitigated.  Sometimes the bad regulatory structure is the second best, and the first best would be a radical liberalization of the entire sector or economy.  But government liberalizing or deregulating doesn\'t necessarily mean no rules or laws or regulations; sometimes institutions or markets just restructure in ways to not need those specific government regulations and sometimes markets provide regulatory incentives or incentives for market actors to abide by non-governmental regulatory bodies (e.g. IIHS or UL). Point being...   That I *do* disagree with this, partly at least, because it doesn\'t have to be the case that giving liberties must result in a libertine free-for-all (which yes, I agree, any set of people, educated or rich or not, will act poorly in that context).  Rules and norms and laws and regulations- we\'re likely to get better ones out of more educated societies, yes.  But again, that\'s going to be a very indirect effect on crime- and I\'m also not convinced that better regulation (market or government) isn\'t also just a matter of built up social capital and experience and robust (wealthy) economies and markets...there\'s so much about modern wealthy society which just nudges us into better behavior, with or without us having to have the education or wisdom to understand the rules deeply or have a philosophical appreciation for them.  Just like each new level of physical capital which we produce, serves as a platform of tools with which to leap into the next level of productivity, such that a million high school dropouts can make a living operating equipment which is the culmination of the knowledge of just a few exceptionally smart scientist and engineers...so too can laws and rules and regs become like social capital which even poorly educated people can avail themselves of and build upon for even better cooperation.  /sorry for the tome...its an interesting subject']"

I\'m talking about any camp that claims to get people sustainable high paying work quickly. Maybe some of these camps are really good at networking but my experience has been devs that can\'t keep up lose their job and any junior making 75k+ is likely to be seen as disposable.      Not all bootcamps are ‚Äù0 XP to $75k in 6 months"". Not sure if this is in line with your question given my previous point, but I do think there\'s value in bootcamps focusing existing knowledge to hirable skills.  There is absolutely value in focusing on hirable skills. My skepticism comes from the ads selling the salary vs the experience.

According to the courts (including the SC) what you are saying only becomes relevant ***after*** the enforcement action is taken (i.e. a private citizen filing a civil lawsuit).

That is relevant only after a private citizen files a lawsuit to enforce the laws above. The defendant can argue as a defense that the activity he is sued for was constitutionally protected. But as the courts noted in the TX law case the courts cannot enjoin private citizens from filing a lawsuit to enforce those laws.""]"

It isn't hypocritical because the animal's consent or harm to the animal was never a concern so apparent inconsistency on that point is irrelevant. The wrongness of bestiality is not the harm to the animal, but the insult to the dignity of humanity to go to such lows.

The reason slaughtering animals for consumption isn't animal abuse is because the object of the conduct is not the killing but the meat which provides a justifiable utility to a person. Self defense, i.e. preserving one's life, is a justifiable utility and what occured in your example.

Okay, strictly speaking, whether the fetus is a human with rights is exactly as relevant to the discussion as whether the fetus is a cat.  I wasn\'t *talking* about cats, I don\'t think cats are pertinent to the discussion, I think you can abort all the cats you like, and I assume the statement ""I don\'t give a shit about cats"" can be taken by a reasonable person (but not, apparently, by you) to mean ""assume that there are no cats involved here from now on"". Nonetheless, if you want to me to confirm that, yes, we are assuming that the fetus is both alive and not a cat, then I suppose that whether the fetus is alive and not a cat is a ""relevant"" question. If you want to claim that as me ""changing my position"", by all means sign off and tell your mother what a clever, clever boy you\'ve been.   You\'re almost there, but remember the last clause ""BUT NOT Right to Live off of Other\'s Body UNLESS Other Consents in Word or Deed"". Now, if I were to respond to your ""Plan B"" issue with, ""Well now, even if we define consensual sex as equivalent to a contractual agreement (and remember, you started that claim, not me), the last contract I signed had a three-day cooling-off period during which I could back out with no questions, shouldn\'t a far more profound agreement have the same?"", then I am NOT changing my position on whether the fetus is alive, I am reflecting on whether the *Consent in Deed is both valid and irrevocable*. And if you\'re still following from earlier, I am open to persuasion on *that* point alone.   &amp;#x200B;   Are you legitimately unable to remember your own words, or are you so intellectually insecure that your idea of an argument is frustrating the other person into giving up on you and declaring victory?   Again, so be it. I\'d rather have a discussion about the definition of binding consent which, *at minimum* ensures that abortion is allowed in the case of rape or underage sex, than a discussion about life which will inevitably default into ""no abortions, even if the case of rape"" when your ridiculously arbitrary definition of life is torn apart.', "" You can point out how uteruses and breast work until you're blue in the face, but those biological functions do not answer the question of *why*, when a woman has the consciousness to know she doesn't want to be pregnant and the tools at her disposal to terminate her pregnancy, she should nonetheless be forced to maintain it.    Again, You say rejecting pregnancy is bucking nature, where as I say it is fully consistent with our nature to pursue self-determination.  Also, this theory that the right to life is a right that a fetus can exercise against its carrier is so tired. The Bill of Rights was generated after the United States liberated itself from Britain to enumerate the things that the United States as the country would not do to its people. They are the rights that people have to be free from arbitrary government harm and interference. They are not rights that people can exercise against each other. Just as you cannot weaponize the supposed right to free speech to control the reaction of private citizens to the things you say, you cannot weaponize the right to life to extract the resources you need to live from other people. In fact, from a constitutional and legal perspective, it is the woman's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that are being infringed upon by the government with an abortion ban is in place, and the question is whether it is being done with due process of law.   You made a call to history and evolution, I did the same. I think since yours ignored what the women at t issue actually want, while mine included it, mine is better, but I'm sure you disagree.   Funny you should mention that, given that you're the one saying that it's okay to use women's bodies in ways they do not want to be used because they're built different than other humans and that proves it's in their nature to do this act they would refuse if given the choice. I think it's also your side that argues forced birth can't be that bad because it's not like it typically kills women? Talk about the wrong side of history...   Forcing women to get pregnant would indeed be misogynistic. This does not mean that the less extreme act of forcing a woman to maintain a pregnancy she wishes to terminate is not misogynistic.   Sorry, I cannot make heads or tails of this, other than to refer to my note above about the fact that fetuses have no rights to the care or resources of other individual, including their mothers.   OP's argument was very clear, concise, and never used the word misogynist or patriarchy: women are assumed to be caregivers and society takes from them without consequence or consideration as a result. You are the one who reduced her reasoning to an accusation of patriarchy and misogyny and then said *she* was using it to stifle debate? Not only are you in a glass house throwing stones, but you're doing it from inside the house.   I see references to fetuses being torn limb from limb on the sub so often I could scream. And if you wanted to debate them, I'm happy to do so, but since 93% of abortions happen in the first trimester and medical abortions are more prevalent than ever given how successfully they were administered since COVID started, maybe the specter of dismembered fetuses shouldn't derail every conversation? Meanwhile 100% of unwanted pregnancies that are carried to term due to abortion restrictions or bans are violative of the bodies and wills of the women carrying them - I don't see how that could possibly be an unwarranted appeal to emotion.""]"

And there the arguments against *do* start to resemble the sorts of arguments you made - the standard of the Spanish league (and Champions League) in Messi‚Äôs time is higher than the Brazilian league (and competitive friendlies) in Pele‚Äôs time. But also consider that‚Ä¶  Pele ‚âà Maradona   Maradona &lt; Messi   Therefore‚Ä¶    (I actually think there‚Äôs a strong case for Puskas being better than Pele or M√ºller, but Messi has more facets to his game than Puskas - he‚Äôs better in the air and actually has a right foot).  I don‚Äôt think Haaland will ever be compared favourably to Messi and Ronaldo unless he starts scoring from outside the box, scoring free kicks, and playing passes like Messi. I don‚Äôt think Mbappe will be viewed the same way unless he leaves PSG and keeps scoring at the same rate.']"

I have nothing against trans people. My concern is that they\'re being used as the worst sort of political football, a ""wedge"" meant to drive one side of an issue apart from the other. Generating a lot of unnecessary resentment for trans people in the process. Secondly my concern is that so called trans activists have unreasonable expectations and unworkable policy goals.   I myself have struggled with mental health issues. The one thing about therapy and self help was the ever present concept that sometimes what\'s in our heads isn\'t reasonable, or even real. Trans activists are guilty of flipping this on its head. What\'s in their head is entirely true and should be acted upon to realize it as reality. That\'s just the total opposite of all the accredited mental health treatment for other issues. You don\'t play into delusions, irrational beliefs, or psychosis. But in trans communities it\'s the opposite. That\'s deeply concerning on its own, but shockingly concerning when minors are being told to arrest their physical and mental development to play along within an uncomfortable issue they\'re dealing with. I truly believe the sympathetic and empathetic response to the situation is to be cautious about such treatment policies. Allow it for adults, sure, but even then it\'s a grey area morally.   Which is why I\'m concerned about the push to change gender listings on government paperwork. It\'s far better for everyone to have an optional extra column for pronouns when they don\'t match the listed biological gender by birth. We can\'t change reality to the degree the gender change on paperwork implies. It\'s playing along with a potentially dangerous fantasy. If we woke up tomorrow and gene editing was advanced to truly switch gender? Then by all means change it fully on the paperwork. I just have a concern when government paperwork truly leaves objective reality behind.    I don\'t think it\'s good for trans people that they\'re the current political football in society. And I don\'t think it\'s good for society to push this recognition onto children. While people say it\'s not being pushed onto children, it clearly is. I have toddlers.

Use ‚Äúassertive hospitality.‚Äù Train your employees to routinely walk the aisles, making eye contact and greeting each shopper with a friendly, ‚ÄúCan I help you find something?‚Äù Be aware of red flags and common target areas for shoplifters. Extra baggy or multi-layered clothes, a nervous demeanor, extra bags, or excessive people watching may be signs of a shoplifter. Be aware of high target items such as cigarettes, meat, and batteries. Watch for open merchandise during checkout and immediately offer to get a replacement item for the customer. Use extreme caution when stopping a shoplifter. The wrong decision could result in injury or death of an employee or customer and/or a costly liability suit. Train your staff thoroughly. You can only legally stop a shoplifter if someone has watched the suspect continuously, observed him or her enter the aisle or section, pick up the item, conceal the item, and attempt to leave the store without purchasing the item. Call police immediately and prosecute. When police arrive, report how you‚Äôve followed the legal requirements above, and follow through with prosecution to show the community and shoplifters that you won‚Äôt tolerate the crime.‚Äù  https://www.riskpointins.com/10-ways-to-deter-shoplifting-at-your-retail-store/']

Trade with the USSR in particular in resources like rubber that the USSR could obtain from Asia is how the Nazis got past the British naval blockade. And this is at the best time to deliver the killer blow to the beast when 3 million men and almost all the aircraft and tanks were committed in the west.   Then why no blow in 1940? Why give nazi Germany the rubber they need for the war machine? Why was the whole red army and air force caught by surprise in June 1941?   Basically the only parties and people in Europe who support Putins invasion of Ukraine are both the far right AND the far left.

Without all that imported oil the germans would never have achieved their victory spearheaded by concentrated armor in the Battle of France. Without gold and equipment from Czechoslovakia the germans would never have even been able to win the war from 1939-1940 so decisively.  The Soviets traded with the Germans to buy for time, their armed forces were not ready for a decisive invasion of Germany at that point. You are again spreading your western liberal propaganda, trying to act like the west is on a position of imagined moral superiority. In reality in 1939 there was nothing about the British, Americans or French that gave them any kind of ""moral superiority"". They were all vicious and brutal imperialists that massacred thousands and hundreds of thousands of people to feed capital and profit, they were worse than the nazis before 1939 but relatively better (and still very very evil) than the nazis after their genocide in concentration camps, noting of course that the Germans murdered atleast 15 million civilian slavs in the balkans and east.   The Soviet army was not ready for a war with Germany yet. They needed until 1943 to go on the offensive even after the war started in 1941.   I don\'t know, ask them lol.

So he doesn't count. Where's a prominent leader voted out by the people?   1939 is after 1921 and after 1934, so I dont care. Its besides the point. The Poles were able to send up to 700k troops and the French 3 million. The French leadership turned out to be cowards and lost their country as a result, quite deservingly. The USSR wasn't even necessary to counter the Germans in 1939 had the Western allies put their heart into the 1939 offensive. Fortunately they helped the USSR out a lot with lend lease and strategic bombing campaigns.  Since we're stuck on ww2 for some reason or another let me close with Phillips P. O'Brien in the Journal of Strategic Studies, East versus West in the defeat of Nazi Germany  from the evidence in the survey is that the Second World War in Europe was, economically speaking, an air war. The German war economy was geared, more than anything else, to the construction and supply of aircraft and anti-air weaponry. In the crucial year of 1943, more than 41 per cent of German munitions production was devoted to making aircraft alone.  The next closest area, at a little more than 29 per cent, was ammunition, followed by naval vessels at 8.43 per cent, weapons (from anti-aircraft guns to artillery pieces to small arms) at 8.02 per cent, motor vehicles at 4.08 per cent, and halftracks at 1.78 per cent. The production of Panzers, considered the queen of the battlefields on the Eastern Front, took up only 6.27 per cent of German war production. In other words tank production took up only three-quarters as much of German production as naval construction, and less than one-sixth as much of German production as aircraft building. The domination of aircraft production continued for the rest of the war. In 1944 the percentage of the German economy devoted to building planes rose and in July of that year, when overall German munitions production reached its peak, over 48 per cent of German war production was aircraft. A further way of measuring the importance of aircraft production within the framework of the German economy can be seen not only by measuring the value of product assigned to each combatant service, but in the allocation of the German workforce. In a speech given by Albert Speer in August 1944, the Reichminister stated that even after the enormous relative increases in tank and self-propelled gun production achieved since early 1943, aircraft production still occupied far more workers than any other single part of the German war economy.   At that time more than 2,100,000 workers were involved in aircraft production while only 1,900,000 were involved in all army production, and 500,000 were employed by the navy. The preeminence of aircraft construction in economic production should lead to a reevaluation of how exactly Germany was defeated. This can best be done by looking at 1943, a year which is often seen as the turning point of the Second World War in Europe. The year 1943 is crucial for several reasons. In 1939 and 1940 the Germans were primarily occupied fighting the West, while in 1941 and 1942 the war against Russia received the highest priority. In 1943, however, the Germans came under attack from both sides. It was the year that saw the great Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk, victories that ended the possibility of any further German strategic offensives on the Eastern Front. In the West, 1943 was when the British and Americans launched their invasions of Sicily and Italy, and began the first large-scale strategic bombing campaign against Germany. Thus, 1943 is also regularly used by those who like to minimise the West's contribution to the defeat of Germany. Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk are thus described as vital steps in the defeat of Germany, while the Anglo-American strategic bombing offensive is usually denigrated. The year 1943 is also important because it was the first year during which German armaments production began to expand dramatically. German war production, as is widely known, was surprisingly limited during the first years of the Second World War. Inefficient utilisation of economic resources in 1939, 1940, and 1941 led to only marginal increases. Between the beginning of 1940 and the end of 1941, total German armament production hardly increased at all.16  In almost every area of weaponry Germany was actually outproduced, in quantity if not in quality, by its opponents before 1943. From this point on home defense received the lion's share of new German production. By 1 January 1944, over 54 per cent of all Luftwaffe operational front-line aircraft strength was in Germany or the West resisting the bomber offensive, with an additional 10 per cent in the Mediterranean and approximately 35 per cent on the Eastern Front.  This kind of deployment would continue for much of the rest of the war. At the same time that the West was soaking up more and more German air resources, it was destroying proportionally more and more as well. Air combat for the Luftwaffe was always more dangerous against the British and Americans than against the Russians. The technological inferiority of the Soviets led to a considerably smaller percentage of German losses on the Eastern Front, even when the Luftwaffe was greatly outnumbered by the Red Air Force. As a point of comparison 3,936 German planes were lost fighting the British and American air forces in the Mediterranean between January and November 1943, while only 3,773 aircraft were lost on the Eastern Front.  When one adds the even larger figure of 4,225 aircraft lost in either Western Europe or the defense of the Reich in the same period, it becomes clear that the British and Americans played by far the largest role in tying down and destroying the German air force in 1943. In percentage terms about 68.5 per cent of all German losses were caused by the British and Americans and the remaining 31.5 per cent by the Russians. These increased losses are extremely important because 1943, as said above, was a year in which German aircraft production leapt markedly. Almost all of this increase occurred in fighter construction. In 1943 the Germans built 10,898 fighters compared to 5,515 the year before.39 However, the Germans were unable to reap any advantage from this extremely large production increase because it was almost all diverted or destroyed by the even larger effort put forward by the Western Allies. Instead of being able to overwhelm the technologically-inferior Russian Air Force on the Eastern Front, the Luftwaffe saw its newest and most professional units continually ground down over Germany's own skies. Again, when one compares the allocation of German fighters at the beginning and the end of 1943 the importance of the West stands out clearly. In January 1943 1,045 single-engine and twin-engine fighters were based in the West running from Norway to Germany into France. At the same time280 fighters were based in the Mediterranean and Balkans, and 445 were fighting in Russia. By 1 January 1944 the number of German fighters in the West had grown by 605 to 1,650, while the corresponding figures for the Mediterranean had grown by 85 to 365 and that for the Eastern Front had actually dropped by 20 to 425.  Have you decided if it was stalin or the party that was anti communist in 1934 already?""]"

Medicine is expensive and you can get unequal treatment depending on your race.   Women have always worked, just white upper class women gained access to higher income jobs during the Civil Rights Era. Asian, Black, Latina, and Indigenous women were all still working before in mostly shit jobs all while trying to raise kids. If you are poor and have no access to higher education, being able to work in upper class jobs does not affect your life in any meaningful kind of way. You are still doing the things similarly to how your own mother and grandmother lived to get by.   Most non-custodial parents do not pay the full amount of child custody that is owed to them. A third of them don't pay any at all.   Divorce is probably the only meaningful change that helps women, but at the same time, divorce financially devastates the family and like I said before, most non-custodial parents don't pay the full amount of child support they are required to pay.   In previous times, there was more extended family available to new mothers to help them through pregnancy and raising children. Many people in the US do not have that kind of familiar support anymore because the nuclear family has been placed on a pedestal. If you choose the wrong man as a husband and father, you have nobody else in many cases to help you. I don't see this as an improvement for American society."", 'Just wanna add, everything I‚Äôm reading says that, yes, child support can go toward housing. It‚Äôs considered a basic need. I can see how it‚Äôs perceived as unfair since the paying parent is paying toward the custodial parents housing but at the same time the kid needs a roof.', 'Yes they should. In a case of 50/50 equal custody neither parent pays child support what so ever, it is only in primary custody that child support is paid. If you are legally restricted from access to your children due to the custodial parent fighting for primary and majority custody then said parent must be responsible enough to prove they deserve said custody. Imagine being told you need to pay for ex wife house and you only get your kids for 1 day every other weekend... Bullshit.  You are divorcing your husband, you are choosing to leave him. If you choose to leave him then you are expected to leave and get the fuck on with your life. Why should you ex husband pay for your house? Bullshit!   Child Support is for Food, Clothing, School, Entertainment, and Medical expenses. And yes, CS covers all of that minus medical, but most divorced children are on Medicaid till they are 18 under the family medical act and therefore they have unlimited free medical care with mere copays and prescription costs, which can be high, but its nothing compared to being an adult and needing an arm and three legs to pay for medical.   So yes. You are the custodial parent by force, you are kidnapping his children and refusing him access. If you are not able to support yourself then why should you have children in the first place? Give the children to him, he clearly had no issue supporting all of you prior to getting wage gouged.   If the man wanted to fight for custody and you got custodial parent status anyway then you don\'t get to complain about caring for the child. You fought to be one doing this shit, you don\'t get to be ""poor me, give me some money cause I do all this"".   Now if he wants nothing to do with the kids then that\'s a different thing altogether. If he didn\'t want custody or split custody and just wants out of the family altogether then let him sign his rights away. But if he tried to be their father, and lost, and now gun wielding people are backing you up in enforcing his state sponsored kidnapping and wage slavery, then yeah, you should be ashamed that you can\'t afford rent and it makes you an unfit parent.  These things are nuanced, of course, but at the end of the day if a man pays child support it is for the child, not you, that is called alimony or spousal support.']"

If a player hits ball in air and it is within the goal posts it will go in. No goalie can stop an airborne ball even if they guess the direction. But that's risky.

All luck no skill"", ""I would definitely rather see this for tiebreakers. The skill level of the players in the video you linked below leaves a bit to be desired (mid-90s MLS players, let's not kid ourselves), but with World Cup or the top European leagues it would be a much more impressive display of the actual game skills of both the shooter and goalkeeper.  For penalties it makes sense to have it heavily skewed in the shooter's favor, but for tiebreakers it always seemed so lopsided and disconnected from the actual skill of the game. It's essentially a game of chance where unless the shooter telegraphs which way he's going to go or misses, the goalie has a one in three chance of guessing right.  Even for penalties though it seems you could use this method but skew it in some way to give the shooter a similar percentage chance to score as it is now, like letting him start closer to the goal line. It would still make penalties costly to defenders, but make skill a more determinative factor than luck.""]"

And the reason there are questions at all is because Egypt was thrown into total political chaos for thousands of years, and very little historical record exists. The most well-maintained accounts of what happened at the time actually come from religious texts like The Bible. So it's harder than you would think to build a case that refutes historical accounts that had been written at the time and were maintained over thousands of years as a matter of religious principle, even if you strip away the metaphysical and paranormal accounts just to examine the actual historical claims.  The point is nobody knows for sure because the only texts that still exist from that time come from The Bible. Everything after that is just digging and speculation. You can speculate that the writings and accounts from the Bible were inaccurate at the time, but even if you reject the religious aspect of the text it was still written to be as accurate an accounting of history that could be collected at the time. You still have to demonstrate why your speculative theory disproves a written historical account that had been judiciously maintained over that same period of time.  And it's all irrelevant anyway. It's not like your opinions on the origins of the pyramids changes your actual public policy positions on matters that are relevant to events today. It's something that anyone who's reasonable educated on the topic acknowledges is all speculation to begin with. But the mass media obsessed over that 20 year old video of Carson talking about the subject as if it was somehow relevant to public policy. It was making a mountain out of a molehill to paint Carson as some kind of religious extremist."", 'Well most of them were born in Egypt,  lived in Egypt and died in Egypt so that sounds pretty Egyptian to me']"

Physical lockpicking (whether in Fallout or TES use the same system) can use stat buffs, in the form of Chems, Magazines, Scrolls, and Blessings, as well as Higher Quality Lockpicks in order to allow them access to the Lockpicking minigame.  Magical lockpicking (in TES only) uses similar stat buffs to achieve the same goal, but in a different way. Whereas physical increases stats to access the minigame, magical increases a different set of stats to actually cast the spell, either to give yourself the magicka or to appease the spell chance algorithm. The exception of course lockbreaking scrolls which can break the lock for you but at a cost.  But still, the biggest tradeoff between the two is strategic in nature rather than tactical.   Physical lockpicking requires the skill and the tool. The tool is trivial. I don't know about you but I've never bought a lockpick or bobby pin in any game except Morrowind, since lockpick quality was a thing there. The skill requires you to either place stat points (NV) or perk points (Skyrim/FO4) which you could otherwise put into combat or other skills.  Magical lockpicking requires the skill and the spell. You probably put points into the skill already because Alteration contains an important spell for mages. The spell however has to be bought or found. You also will need multiple versions to handle higher and higher level locks and those higher level spells cost more magicka, meaning more investment into that as well, though you also probably do that anyway being a mage.""]"

If you are okay with public elementary and high schools, why not secondary education as well?"", ' That isn\'t true at all. That\'s the whole point the OP is trying to make. In a lot of poor communities, the parents aren\'t parenting properly. Don\'t believe me? I have a story that should convince you (it sure as hell convinced me):  [At this school in Baltimore, 50% of students have a 0.13 GPA or lower.](https://foxbaltimore.com/news/project-baltimore/calls-to-shut-down-city-school-where-013-gpa-ranks-near-top-half-of-class)  Before you blame funding, this district averages about $18,000 per student, which is quite high. Among the highest in the nation, actually.  Before you blame the schools for not spending the money properly: that might be true, but even if it is, even the most horrendous management of funds at a school can\'t explain fully half of the students having a 0.13 GPA. Note, that\'s ZERO point 13. Not 1.3. 1.0-1.9 is a failing grade, btw.  This isn\'t a failure to properly educate students. These 50% of students or more aren\'t even trying. Even if they\'re showing up, they\'re giving no effort whatsoever in their classes. I\'d wager that students typically get a GPA that low by not even showing up.  That looks bad for the school, but what is the extent of their authority when a student just straight-up doesn\'t attend school? Do they send out the gestapo to haul them back? AFAIK the schools\' responsibility is to notify the parents of the truancy, even more than once. But if the parents won\'t take action, I would say they\'re the ones to blame. In fact I wonder if the school ever has the authority to notify the police if the parents don\'t seem to care about their kids\' truancy and have the cops talk to their parents. Maybe that\'s too draconian - making parents care about their kids and all.  There\'s a quote in that article from one of the mothers of a student with a 0.13 GPA:  **&gt;(the mother) says the school never told her that her son was failing until last month**  Maybe you\'re a dad/mom. Imagine yourself as one if you\'re not. You don\'t ""hear"" from the school about your kids\' performance, whatever that means in particular. The first few weeks, your kid doesn\'t have any grades to show you, they say they can\'t access them and they aren\'t being given to him. You think huh, that\'s weird - but you decide to wait a little longer. Still your son says, no grades, no access to grades. You consider calling the school, but for some reason you don\'t. Time passes, and...then what? Are you still asking your child about their grades? Are they still insisting they don\'t know their grades or aren\'t being told their grades? What do you do then? You would probably call the school at some point, wouldn\'t you?  So there\'s a problem with culture here. The parents are not teaching their children to value education. You can bet the majority or more of them know about their children\'s terrible grades. If you don\'t care to follow your kids\' performance in school, that\'s deeply troubling. So I\'ll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they\'re all aware of their kid\'s performance. The parents aren\'t taking measures to correct the problem. That much is clear.  And this can be reinforced with another collection of unpopular data: literacy rates are abysmal in Baltimore.  Within the Baltimore City Public Schools, 13 percent of fourth-graders tested at or above proficient in reading in 2019, the same as in 2017. Eighth-grade scores improved slightly, with 15 percent of students at or above proficiency this year compared to 13 percent in 2017.  Math scores for city students remained fairly similar, with 15 percent of fourth-graders and ten percent of eighth-graders at or above proficiency in 2019.  It seems to me impossible to blame anything other than a problem outside of the school. I don\'t know about you, but my parents read to me often and made sure I was able to read when the time came.  You might be tempted to blame the schools for not picking up the ball and teaching their students reading themselves. It seems they\'re trying to. But you can only lead a horse to water, you can\'t make it drink. Even the most earnest literacy program only works if the students want it to.']"

Which is why it is unwise to ""do a better job"" when you\'re getting paid ""adequate job"" wages. If an employer wishes for you to do a better job, then they should include compensation for increased performance in your work agreement. If they do not, they are attempting to get the deluxe car wash after paying for the economy. That is wage theft.  ""Hey, give me the value meal for the price of a burger for a year, and hopefully I will start paying you more later.""  In *any other context*, such an arrangement would be considered an idiotic bargain, only accepted by the most naive.  But somehow, the working class has been brainwashed for.a century to accept this notion that they have a burden to prove worthy of pay before getting it, while business needn\'t prove worthy of quality work before expecting it. It is the height of entitlement. And it is exploitation. That is the status quo.   Tell me how many ""feel better about your job"" are needed to pay a car note? Is that about the same exchange rate as being paid in exposure?  You know what\'s a huge bonus? An agreement to pay a huge bonus for exceptional work. You know what isn\'t a huge bonus? Non monetary compensation. Because until a company lets me buy their widgets with job satisfaction, it has no business being in a discussion on fair compensation.   And there\'s nothing that says that everyone in the country can\'t be a millionaire. But it doesn\'t reflect reality. Appropriate salaries are things employers avoid paying as much as possible, which is why 50 years ago, the bottom 50% of earners controlled 20% of the wealth, and today, that group controls 2% of it.  Money is consistently and uniformly being funnelled away from the working class to the oligarchy. So I suppose the only people that say you can\'t get paid an appropriate salary are the people responsible for paying salaries.  The notion of surviving on job satisfaction while waiting for employers to come around on pay is possibly the most naive thing I have read today.  You can love your job. 100% support that. There are benefits for the employer and employee. *But none of those benefits should be work that is valued above what an employer is paying for.*  You can hate your job and still do it. Not my business. *But your dissatisfaction should not lead you to provide work valued below what your employer is paying for.*  In other words, job satisfaction should have no relevance, at all, to the value of the labor you provide. The only thing that should be relevant to the value of the work provided is the value of the compensation for it. Period.   Any advocacy for an increased amount of value provided, above what is paid for? Is advocacy for the exploitation of workers. You are advocating worker exploitation, despite the lip service you occasionally throw to ""that\'s wrong, but still love your job and your employer who is underpaying you and work reeeeeealllly hard so that one day, you might get noticed and rewarded, if you\'re really lucky. I mean, yeah it\'s wrong, but my message is basically to shut up, love your job, and take it.""  That\'s the message you communicate when you levy zero accountability to employers. Which is exactly the level you are levying.  This CMV is not on the benefits of job satisfaction. It is on the acceptability of providing labor exclusively based on the monetary compensation provided. My arguments are about providing labor exclusively based on the monetary compensation. Your argument is a nebulous red herring about whether or not people that like their job work harder.  It is off topic and irrelevant to the CMV.', ' I get your point. I do. It is as true as it is irrelevant.  If someone who enjoys their job.does better work because they enjoy their job, even without additional compensation, they are incentivizing an employer to exploit them.  It is fine to like your job. There are a whole host of benefits for the employer and employee. Healthier work environment and better job satisfaction are two.  But one that should never, ever, *ever* be an employer benefit is ""better quality work"". Because you liking your job is not relevant to the work you do. Or more appropriately, if the only way you will attain a fair work level is if you love your job, *you\'re a bad employee*. If you\'re a good employee, giving fair labor already, and you do more because you love your job, then every day you are not compensated for that, your employer is demonstrating that they are a bad employer.  ""Loving your job"" should have zero impact on the quality of your work. If it does, it points to the likelihood that the employee has poor willpower and self motivation, which are not  \'good employee\' traits.  I get your point. I understand it. *It just doesn\'t accurately reflect truth*.  Your employer is entitled to a fair day of your work for a fair wage.  You are entitled to fair compensation for all work you do.  Employers have been consistently failing to meet their obligations, resulting in the consequence that any employee that does being exploited.  Before you talk about being a good employee, show me a single example of a good employer, that employs over 500 people.', ' There is another term for that. ""Market value"". If Netflix gives you just enough options to not cancel, then it is appropriately priced for its options. If your work is sufficient to ensure your employer continues the relationship, your labor is appropriate.  If your employer raises your wages, it then has every right to expect more. Just as if an employee pushes beyond that, that employee has every right to expect greater compensation.  Only problem is, employees that work harder, in the overwhelming majority of cases, cannot expect that extra labor to be fairly compensated.   A good employee only belongs with a good employer. For all the talk about what an employee must do to be worthy, few ever consider what an employer must do. Out of every employer I have had, and everybody I have asked, I can count the number of good employers I have heard of on zero fingers. If an employer advocates or works to prevent union formation, it is a bad employer. If an employer\'s minimum annual raise doesn\'t match the inflation rate, it is a bad employer.  So the question is... why do bad employers deserve those mythical \'good employees\'. When someone goes above and beyond for someone else that exploits them, the descriptor I would.use for such a person isn\'t ""good"", but rather, ""naive"".   For every person paid well by employers, 1000 are paid unfathomably low. So, while it is literally true that most employers pay *people* well, the corollary is that the number of people paid well is almost always fewer than 1% of those employed.   \'for the amount we are willing to pay.\'  That\'s the unspoken last part of your sentence. Your argument is not far off from ""but nobody wants to work anymore."" The full sentence.is ""nobody wants to work anymore for the slave wages we offer"".  Employers are largely paying D- wages and expecting A- employees. And the workforce is waking up to the fact that the picture you are painting is a fantasy for most. A pleasant fiction, with little basis in fact or truth.']"

You alwayd need a reason for logical morality. You cant just be like breathing is immoral. Same with any rule/order, you cant just say ""you arent allowed to breath"" or ""you arent allowed to eat some1s bodily fluids if they are sick"" if you dont have a reason because no1 will listen to you. The same way we can logically rate reasons with morality to have a logical rule. Saying morality has multiple options is just leaving it unfinished and ignorant.  For example the cow thing. So you arent allowed to eat cows because that would mean a cow would have had to have been killed in order for that to happen and thats not cool since you need milk from those cows. And obviously its good to not kill cows to get what you cinstantly need. Now we could go into how important is it for every cow to produce milk and how the market would look like but even though possible to find out, annohing to, so lets just skip that.  Lets instead see other things your beliefs of cows means. You also cant harm them or scare them to move them against their will. This is obviously meaningless for moral because even though there are arguments against it most of them are close to meaningless in importance. As you can see these things arent moral anymore.', ""I mean philosophically speaking, what does any of that mean? Where does the line get drawn for which living beings to eat and which not to? Plants are alive as well. They breathe and eat and reproduce and then we eat them. Ofc I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. But they're alive. And I'm also not trying to point out any hypocrisy, Because in doing so would I not be? We each draw our lines of what is and isn't alright to eat. Cows have been... Ruined by humanity, the same way pigeons were. If you didn't know, by the way, pigeons were heavily domesticated back in the day because they were very useful as messengers. Pigeons are now considered plague. They bring upon disease and many people kill them like rats (because they basically are the air equivalent of them)... So then what will my happen to the cows? We'd have to make them extinct. A farmer would have to take care of all their cows until they die because they would be unable to survive properly in the wild. Humanity has damaged the environment to such an extent, that regardless of what we do now, the cows will remain in one way or another, at the very least for the lifetime of the youngest cow today. At most forever if they are to have the fate of the pigeons. So in what Respect do we propose to end the practice? I like the idea of lab grown meat because it might make me feel better about myself and my carbon footprint, but in the end the farms will stay and I doubt production will decrease highly until the lab grown variety becomes a standard, which is unlikely to happen anytime soon.   On a side note: what about reptiles? Would you eat a reptile? They don't have emotions, (this much is true evolutionarily) so while they would probably feel pain, who's to say  a plant cannot? Does the plant not release smells in order to avoid getting killed? Is this not why onions male us cry?   Why, then, did I choose to write this long winding paragraph for a random stranger on Reddit. Am I justifying my habits? Maybe so. Am i tired of people acting all self-righteous about their diet? Possibly. But I believe the answer lies in my sleep deprivation and the fact that I've been at the airport for three hours and I don't know when I'll be able to board my plane. As a matter of fact, they told me to fuck right off when I tried to check my baggage in."", ""I am trying my hardest to live off of the land, meaning growing and producing as much of my food as possible.

I am not vegetation, if you are that is fine, but my goal is to stop using the grocery store for as much food as possible. I cannot be self sufficient on a vegetarian diet in the climate I live in.  It is very judgmental to assume what I am doing is wrong.    Because I know that trucking food grown on factory farms is bad for the environment and bad for me, I have chosen this lifestyle.  No one in 1000s of years has survived in northern climate on a vegetarian diet.   My growing season here is about 100 days, sometimes less.  So I raise chickens, goats, and rabbits.  I also can, dry food, forage and hunt.     The beautiful thing is that my goats eat almost everything.  They are eco-friendly on a small scale.  They eat the weeds, and then give manure and milk and meat.  That is why cultures all over the world use them in agriculture.  I chose them over pigs and cows because I live in the bush and don't have the space to grow food for food and the goats literally will eat what grows here.  They eat poison ivy and brambles like it's hay to a cow.  No one enjoys dispatching an animal unless they have unresolved mental issues.  But I am trying my best to live sustainably as my ancestors did, and I am living naturally in tune with nature as best as I can, and that includes raising meat.    I am fairly certain that my carbon footprint is very low living like this and it would be much higher if I was eating vegetarian from the grocery store because I literally cannot grow enough calories to stay alive here and those trucks from the factory farms have a long way to go to get here.

If that‚Äôs your view, then say that. Many people, myself included, focused on the relation to YouTube because that‚Äôs what your title and most of your responses focused on. You can have a more general discussion on nudity if you want, just be more upfront with it.   I guess the analogy feels weird to me, because dancing is an activity that many people may never do or do so rarely as to not seriously interact with, and it is usually done with other people. Nudity, on the other hand, is a state that people experience with their own bodies every day, constantly, but privately, without others around. Rather than nudity, if feels like ‚Äúsex‚Äù would be the more accurate replacement for dancing in your analogy:   I know that‚Äôs not what you mean, though. You are explicitly advocating for de stigmatizing non-sexual nudity. But the existence of so many sexual related things *off* of mainstream websites like Facebook and YouTube show that taboo and stigma are not enough to cause this stifling of creative, interesting content. For instance, I think it‚Äôs highly unlikely that fewer people have sex just because it isn‚Äôt on YouTube.  So, all that to say, if we are missing creative opportunities with non-sexual nudity, it‚Äôs probably not the fault of social media choosing not to promote it.

So far, the highest turnout during a midterm for this voting bloc is 2018 when about 31% of young people who are eligible to vote cast a ballot.  During a briefing Thursday, Abby Kiesa ‚Äî deputy director at CIRCLE ‚Äî said 2018 remains ""a high-water mark"" for youth voter turnout during midterms in the U.S. since at least since the 1970s.

""Imposing federal policies"" is exactly what Eisenhower did when he sent the army to Little Rock to enforce desegregation. The rights of children to an equal education were being offended by state laws and actions that SCOTUS had ruled unconstitutional.   Imposing Constitutional rights (federally) is literally what the Constitution was written to do.    And what if state A\'s law conflicts with state B\'s law, as in my previous example? Which law prevails?   We can\'t subject one person to two conflicting laws and remain a society under law.

It's good to look back on how people were oppressed and what tactics were used to help prevent those same policies from being implemented into modern society.  Where it's bad: At the high level idea of Oppressor vs Oppressed, CRT explains that there are metaphorical chains holding down groups of people such that no matter how hard they may try, the ruling class will always seek to hold them down and prevent them from succeeding. The issue with this is that it may have applied 60 years ago, but after a slew of laws preventing discrimination, it's not as true as it once was. In a Marxist's ideas, the only way to break oppression is usually with sudden and violent revolts against the ruling class.

I can see why people on the ""alt right"" eventually did slip into the role that they were being accused of being.

But for what it\'s worth to you, I\'m not on the fence about it. I firmly believe all fantastic claims of a supernatural entity of any kind require equally fantastic evidence, and all patterning so far indicates there is no forthcoming fantastic evidence. No one can prove a negative, sure, but many claims within the Bible have been disproved.  And we have effectively proved that even the earliest surviving eyewitness account of Christ was  recorded at least a generation after his supposed resurrection, though generations were shorter then so it was more likely two. So I feel pretty safe saying that this god doesn\'t exist.  But anyway, if you believe everything how do you square the creation myths of Kronos, Yamato, Allah, Ra, Quetzucoatl, Yahweh, and Odin, to name a few?  Do I believe in love? Depending upon how you define it, yes. What do I think of the claim that god = love? I think that many of God\'s adherents through our history and even a number of contemporary practitioners do not embody that ideal. I find several acts of, ""love,"" portrayed in the Bible to be puzzling cruel, violent, malevolent, and often enough petty. I find I would have to cherry pick from our examples of God to match how I would define or even describe love. I\'ll entertain your equation for now, though I will eventually ask you to show your math.', 'It is actually trivially easy to disprove omnipotence.   Can god make a stone that he cannot lift?  If not then god is not omnipotent because there is something god cannot do. If yes then god is also not omnipotent because god cannot lift the stone.

All means everything, end of story ...   The thing is many people are irrational and can't deal with not having a purpose. Believe can help with that but in the end it's nothing more than an escape from the reality, that the universe is simply apathetic and simply is. Even if a higher being exists then it still makes 0 sense as written, because the writing isn't even internally consistent and paradoxical in many ways ...   Either the holy textures are entirely correct and true or you can't know what parts would be true or false. More importantly god/Allah is also omnipotent... Not that hard to write a logical holy scripture or have it written while being consistent and not paradoxical, especially if your omniscient and omnipotent. However the best example to which I still have never heard anyone give/show an actual logical defence that holds up is for the problem of evil.  Btw some people propose that god is not omnibenevolent, great then he's a narcissist for and I wouldn't want to pray to such a self entitled POS.

The tissue was taken and Henrietta lacks was not compensated. The tissue at that time had very little utility. It was made useful by a series of academic researchers who made a cell line called HeLa that they freely distributed. They didn‚Äôt make any money off this. You can still get the cell line for free. People than used this freely available cell line that did not come with any licensing obligations to perform research to develop entirely different products that were profitable.  So ethically it seems that researchers turned medical waste into something useful that has been used for a variety of experiments both academic and commercial. I don‚Äôt see why the family member of the person from whom the cancer tissue was taken should be compensated. Compensation is usually for some work somebody did or to compensate somebody for harm. I don‚Äôt see Henrietta lacks or her family doing any work. I don‚Äôt see any harm. I don‚Äôt see any reason they should be compensated.', 'I believe in the concept of reparations generally speaking. However these biopsy samples were taken from numerous people, black white rich and poor. None of these people were ever compensated for the biopsy samples. This was tissue that would‚Äôve been thrown away otherwise but was used to advance medicine and help other people. Based on this, Henrietta Lacks was treated no differently and the tissue taken from her body was taken to help her and would‚Äôve been thrown away but for the efforts of the researchers who did all the work.  In the scenario, Henrietta‚Äôs body wasn‚Äôt taken, rather a cancer was removed in an effort to save her life. Tissue that had no value was made valuable through the work of other people. I don‚Äôt see how she really added any value. I certainly don‚Äôt think there is any merit to any claim of discrimination since samples from white people and rich people were treated the same way.  Personally I think her family is playing the race card to try and get money from companies and organizations. If you can show me any evidence of discrimination, please go ahead. However I can‚Äôt find anything to say that a person of a different race would‚Äôve been treated differently.', 'I agree that if somebody was wronged, their surviving family members should be able to seek compensation. My point is that I cannot seem to find any significant injustice that Henrietta Lacks suffered.  To clarify what happened, she had a malignant cancer removed from her cervix. That surgery was going to be performed regardless since it was cancer. That tissue that was going to be thrown out was used in an experiment and some of those cells were able to be grown. Those cells were used in many subsequent experiments .  There are two issues I can think of here. First is that no consent was obtained. However consent in the 1950s was essentially not common practice. I think it might make sense to try and compensate every patient who‚Äôs tissue was used without consent back then, however I don‚Äôt think it makes sense to compensate just one person and ignore the rest of the people who are also Affected by this practice.  The second issue is that her sample went on to create a valuable soul and that other people have profited from. Some people think that she or her family should be able to profit from those products. The issue I have with this is that generally speaking, patients are not compensated for their biopsy tissue and certainly not given a percentage of the profits of anything developed from it. Is this fair? It is the system that medical organizations all over the world have all decided is the norm so it seems to be standard ethical practice. I also think that makes sense since discoveries made in your treatment should go on to benefit other patients and you shouldn‚Äôt be able to withhold knowledge in exchange for payment.']

First, while the bourgeoisie does have a class interest in fighting against communism, that doesn't stop the fact that the bourgeoisie is also comprised of individuals and factions that are in competition with one another. Russia is a major competitor in oil, gas, and a number of other areas. Naturally, the US is going to want to hurt its competition.  But also, the US's conflict with Russia needs to be viewed at least partly in the context of the US's fear of a rising China, as well as in light of the US's efforts to strangle Cuba, the DPRK, and Venezuela, among other countries. Russia is a major trade partner and energy supplier of China and of various smaller US targets. Biden very clearly views China, more so than Russia, as a major threat to US hegemony and the existing neoliberal world order. So rather than go after China more directly (as Trump did), his administration seems to want to strangle and destroy China's most important allies.  This whole thing is a little bit bigger than just China though. The US has a lot of enemies it would like to strangle, but which are essentially reinforcing one another. The US tries to go after Syria and Iran, and Russia provides them with military support. The US tries to strangle Venezuela, and Iran sends them aid. What we're seeing is the birth of an anti-imperialist bloc, with China and Russia as the power players, and the US wants to collapse that whole network.  So this is about securing US national capitalist interests. It's about weakening Russian capitalism, about weakening China, and about weakening global resistance to US imperialism."", 'While I understand where you are coming from I disagree on almost every point you make.

The chances of that happening now are pretty close to zero.  Let us not try to debate that here.  Now, will Russia ""win""?  That\'s a huge question that every pundit I listen to has a different opinion of what ""winning"" or ""losing"" is.  I find myself inclined to think of them as temporary setbacks or temporary gains.  I mean when the USSR broke up, that was a huge ""loss"", yet here we are not even 30 years later with Russia seriously gaining World leadership and American hegemony being destroyed.    People dismiss the SCO and the EAEU and the CSTO and the INSTC and the BRICS, but not me.  The US continues to push neo-colonialism.  China (especially) and Russia work to establish win/win scenarios.  The ""Global South"" sees the difference and is more often siding with China against the US.  Russia and China have just established even closer relationships.  All of Asia is turning against US hegemony.  The EU is waking up to the fact that it is a disposable puppet controlled by the US Oligarchy.  I agree that the US Oligarchy    and    (except for the fact that you conflate the US with the US Oligarchy)  I totally reject    rather the S300 has shown itself to be a much better weapons system than the patriot (Check out Brian Berletic), the M777 is a worthless artillery weapon since it is too complicated; the F35 is a piece of junk.  Russia has rewritten the rules of war.  The US depends on close-air support.  The Russians use drones, missiles and artillery.  The US planes can\'t defend themselves against the S300 let alone the S400 or S500.  SWIFT is becoming something that no one cares about any longer.  It isn\'t going to happen overnight, but Russia and China are successfully setting up alternative methods for settling transactions that do not depend on SWIFT.  And only idiots would store their nations wealth in dollars now that the US has shown it cannot be depended upon to honor those commitments.  &amp;#x200B;  But the real question is the Neocons isn\'t it.

Not the same thing.   Why does the operation of a supermarket then only make the owner rich, but not the consumers? If the transactions are mutually beneficial, why does the owner\'s wealth continuously increase from running his profitable business, while his customers who visit his store every day are not seeing a comparable increase in their wealth from the same exchanges? Looks like a pretty one sided benefit to me.   Yes, sure, for your definition of value, it\'s a subjective opinion. We\'ll never agree on a definition of value. Fine. But let\'s not argue semantics. *Wealth* comes from production. The things that money can buy come (except for land) from factories (either directly or indirectly, for example the tools of an artisan). And this is the actual point. The LTV makes the case that value comes from production, as surplus value, as opposed to subjectivist theories that claim it can come from circulation (buying low, selling high). Subjectivist theories say you can get rich from being good at speculation. The LTV says that the wealth is made by workers.   This is, essentially, correct. You\'re no doubt familiar with that ridiculous mud cake ""refutation"" of the LTV that claims mud cakes should be expensive if they were difficult to make. Of course the LTV claims no such thing, because the production of mud cakes is not socially necessary labour. And yes, under capitalism the only way to find out if labour is socially necessary or not is if people buy the damn thing at the end of the day. Marx discusses this at length very early on in Capital.   But what is the actual causality going on here? We put labor into things we value. Correct. And what is the result? These things are produced more and more efficiently, they become more and more abundant, and then they become cheaper and cheaper. I\'m sure people don\'t value food any less today than they did a thousand years ago. But the result is that food has become superabundant and dirt cheap across the Western world because we put so much labor into it and optimized its production so much that its value has diminished immensely. This is true for almost all things. When we really like things they get cheaper over time. The LTV is a straightforward explanation for this. That strange claim that ""things are expensive because people like them"" explains nothing.    Of course Marx had an agenda but it wasn\'t based on any ethics or morality bullshit. He just hated the rich. There isn\'t a moral argument anywhere in Marxism. The reasoning just goes ""the workers can bring down capitalism, here\'s how, go for it."" Of course seizing the means of production is horribly unfair and immoral towards the rich. Marxism doesn\'t try to refute this. It\'s just irrelevant. In the Critique of the Gotha Programme Marx literally says: ""Do not the bourgeois assert that the present-day distribution is ""fair""? And is it not, in fact, the only ""fair"" distribution on the basis of the present-day mode of production?"" But it\'s not a relevant question.   I did. It was pretty funny because it doesn\'t help your case at all. The first point he makes is that ""profits are a sign that value is created in the economy."" Absolutely correct! VALUE IS CREATED. I thought it didn\'t ""come from"" anything? Then he goes on about political entrepreneurship or rent seeking, which is, whatever. It\'s just an interesting observation here that private profit seeking is a barrier to the development of society because society clearly needs to advance to alternative energy sources. Then he mentions the ""profit test"", which Marx already explained, calling it ""the salto mortale of the commodity"", and which I already mentioned above in the context of mud cakes.', ' How is price irrelevant?    No it is not. That is a trite and useless observation. Subjective value theory predicts the same thing.   The LtV is *Explicitly* a theory about how the magnitude of value is exactly equal to the magnitude of embodied labor time.    A theory of value that only applies to mass produced fungible commodities (and only when they are at equilibrium prices) hardly seems like a good theory.   Why not stick with subjective value theory? It applies to all goods at all times.    Congrats! You‚Äôve now admitted that the LTV is just a subjective theory of value. If the price of labor is subjectively determined by the laborer‚Äôs needs and wants, then all value is subjectively determined!  Marx made the same error and was unable to reconcile this with his assertion that values are objective.', ' Labor value itself is subjective, meaning that the LTV in this case is just a form of the STV.']"

Her critics vociferously deny this utterly false claim that Zharkova is making."", 'That was painful to read through.  Arrogant scientists engaging in mean apologetics is a bit disgusting to witness.  Zharkova\'s paper ties empirical observations to SIM cycles. She doesn\'t necessarily explain why this correlation exists.  As many people noted, irrespective of orbital mechanics, the reality of SIM means substantial changes in the tidal effects of plasma within the Sun. It could just as easily be this which causes SIM cycles to correlate to climatic changes on Earth.  However, it took one Brian Takita to finally make the point that our model of the solar system based on Kepler\'s observations would necessarily be accurate over a long time frame of 100s of years, but there still remains a possibility that over 1000s of years the current model would start to become inaccurate because of this concept of the planets all orbiting a system barycenter.  The point of disagreement, at least in terms of observations, is noting that it takes 100s to 1000s of years for SIM cycles to progress. It\'s not a phenomenon that would show up in a short term model of the solar system\'s orbital mechanics.  In other words, within a few centuries time frame, you can model the solar system by assuming planets exclusively orbit their own unique barycenter with the Sun. And of course, the admission that the Sun itself orbits a SSB. However, the catch is that over 1000s of years the entire system is orbiting the SSB.  That is, Earth IS in fact orbiting the SSB, not the Sun-Earth barycenter, however, the difference between the two is only measurable over thousands of years. That\'s not stated completely accurately. Something more like the Sun-Earth barycenter processes around the SSB over 1000s of years. Something like that.  It does seem like it remains an unanswered question. That scienceTM has realized that this question relates to the sacred grail of climate science, and so it\'s untouchable and won\'t be investigated. Like so much of climate alarmism poisoned science, the question doesn\'t need to be investigated so it can be ignored for now. Orbital models would only be affected by SIM in the long run, so they wouldn\'t need to incorporate the concept for centuries.  Nevertheless, Zharkova\'s paper still identifies some correlation between SIM cycles and climate.  Plenty of statistical nitpicking which even that peer group was unhappy about. Criticisms of Zharkova\'s English ability. Being nasty and rude but then claiming it\'s just being direct, but then critiquing her for being agitated.  What a mess.  Thanks though. As always, every time I dig into a controversial point related to climate I learn almost every time that the alarmist position is wrong, and gain insight into how institutional science is capable of consistently supporting bad science. Science can be hard, which is just a way of saying that lies, arrogance, dissimulation and so forth can make inquiry and debate resolution quite difficult.  It has been argued that Science has to be extremely adversarial in order to properly function, institutionally. Big, nasty, drawn out fights between committed intelligent people. Because sometimes issues are just quite complex and the ""point"" is missed. Look at biological and social sciences, where ethics panels pre-screen papers to avoid any controversy or hurt feelings. What a modern world.  u/randomhomonid what do you think?', 'I\'ve looked into it further and part of your ""orbits are known"" includes the fact that SIM affects the eccentricity of Earth\'s orbit, which has been known for a long time. The claim is that this change in eccentricity is minor, moreover it doesn\'t change the average distance from the Sun.  Zharkova addressed this in a whole paper. The seasonal/axial position of the Earth relative to perihelion is where the change solar irradiance comes from.  So, Zharkova is neither inventing new concepts about orbits, nor is she claiming something that is outside of what ""has been known forever"".  You MAY still argue that even with all this in mind, the effect is too minor to be worth consideration, but that\'s different than what is claimed.  This very strongly resembles institutional wagon-circling, and disingenuous, fallacious gatekeeping.  Zharkova is partly at fault for her poor English ability, but her critics were coming with an agenda.  Her ""basic logic check"" was valid. The SSB is not merely the average of all planet-Sun barycenters. If it was, the Sun\'s center of mass would orbit the SSB in a perfect circle. The Sun is carried on an inertial ride around the SSB, it\'s ""tossed about"", leading to non-circular orbit patterns. That necessarily implies that the planets are not totally and rigidly locked to their barycenter with the Sun.  Again, we do see variations in the Earth\'s eccentricity orbiting the Sun.

Every major country stretches the rules at one point or another, the question is whether India chooses to be like Russia, and break them outright, or like China, and challenge the legitimacy of the rules entirely.  There‚Äôs a difference between India doing what America wants and India following the rules-based order. Indeed, as recent WTO actions show, America itself occasionally clashes with the rules it helped to create.   A world with a stronger India that helps to enforce those rules is likely one in which America is less able to violate them. A world in which India breaks norms in order to challenge America, as Russia and China have, would herald an indefinite conflict.', 'I agree in general, I think it\'d be great for both countries (and therefore the world) if they could come to terms on the border but that seems unlikely to happen.

I\'m curious in it as a foil to China since a lot of the antagonism against china is justified as due to its Marxist dictatorship, but I suspect it\'s just hostility to a non-western power.

Independent India wasn\'t blamed for this, but in 1951 they unilaterally annexed the ""Northeast Frontier Agency"" despite having no authority to do so. Not even parliament approved of the McMahon line, and it was clearly illegal by international convention.  India insisted upon this border by force of arms (sending Bob Khathing to secure the annexation). Tibet was de jure acknowledged as part of Chinese territory by almost every nation in the world including all 4 non-China allied powers. In 1959 India sent small arms after the 14th Dalai Lama\'s brothers instigated a small and failed revolt in Lhasa before whisking him and tens of thousands of mostly Tibetan aristocrats away to India.  India then annexed Goa (which unlike Hong Kong, was legally ceded in perpetuity to its colonial occupier) in 1961 and kept pushing aggressive rhetoric all the while very clearly trying to encircle Chinese positions north of the McMahon line.  Then Nehru proceeded with his Forward Policy despite concerns from his generals, many of which he promptly fired for their dissent.  India attacked China, lost, played the victim, [interned innocent Chinese Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Chinese-Indians#:~:text=The%20Internment%20of%20Chinese%2DIndians,Defence%20of%20India%20Act%2C%201962), and vowed revenge. Some suspect that this surge in patriotism helped India stay together when the idea of Dravida Nadu was being floated.  China has since proposed dozens of times to finalize the Line of Actual Control so that they can have clear and peaceful borders with all 14 land neighbors. India has refused every time, continuing to claim Aksai Chin despite the British never in history having finalized that border with China. The claim line India insists upon was on an unpublished map that Nehru discovered in old archives, that were aspirational at best. The British cartographer was admonished by Parliament.     Ever since China has been trying to manage India\'s temper on the issue. As you\'ll note the border is largely disarmed and, on a per capita basis, has seen very few deaths.']"

Abortion is not legal in Malta  If you want to actually support mens rights you would support abortion because 25% of abortions are done because the father wanted one. Real abortion is also the first step towards paper/financial abortion', 'The entire purpose of having a ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù is that they will accept any abandoned baby no questions asked.

Child support is on average a couple hundred dollars a month and most of it goes unpaid. There are better reforms that could be done like considering time spent with the child (outside of scheduled time), gifts bought for the child and factoring in the actual cost of raising a child.  Men definitely do get a say when abortion is legal it is just not the final say. So what I‚Äôm taking from this is that instead of being pro-men which is what this subreddit should be - fighting the lives of men to improve- you‚Äôre anti-women and resentfully want to punish women because in some countries (not Malta) they have the right to an abortion.

How did the author define a healthy marriage. What characteristics? What are your reasons to believe that women seeking abortions and their sex partners share those characteristics?  I need a citation that in the referenced studies that the parents who were married wanted to be married to each other. It is your claim, so you can define what that means? Wanted to be married on the day they were married? 50 years of uninterrupted marital bliss? Whatever it is, please provide your citation that in the studies that demonstrated that children of married bioparents do better that the bioparents wanted to be married.    You mean all other things being equal. Actually, I am getting confused by your argument. Are you arguing that the children of a single woman who got married and got a marriage payment would not be better off if she got married and didn't get the marriage payment. Or are you arguing that the children of the woman would be better off if she got the payments even if she was married?   Sorry, typo. I meant to say: You seem to think single parents can't just go marry the other parent.    Because the data show this is less than ideal for the average child. If I am going to make these levels of changes to society, I really want to aim for the best possible situation.    I mean, how often do you think that happens? Laws don't exist to make sure that every possible thing in your life is already laid out for you, including everything that is highly unlikely to happen. People have to live their own lives. If some rare exceptional thing happens, you may be faced with rare exceptional choices. But for the hundreds of millions of other people, the law can provide some practical, broad support.    I don't want to incentivize gestation. I want all parties to get what they want. PL - no abortions. PC - more choices. Society - more and better citizens.  Society is not satisfied with women gestating and then abandoning children in garbage cans.    What are you talking about? Can you show me any US state marriage law that requires people certify they love each other? Are you serious with this?   Look, if you want to look for creative solutions, you cannot have such an inside the box attitude.    I think you will not get society on board. Paying women to give birth but having no expectations on what happens to the child after that. Perhaps all the claims of PCs about PLs not caring what happens to kids once they are born is just projection.    This is just discrimination. You can hire the best person for a job. The data show married bioparents are the best parents for kids.    Except marriage ties together two people's financial situations. The man is incentivized to marry the woman, as they now both have claims to the payments.    I already said either way. Are you in with no abortion restrictions? It seems like no.    Good thing this never happens, even if everyone is trying to get there.    The problem with this suggestion is why should I do it? Tell me why I should give money to a woman just because she gave birth. That seems like a horrible idea. Women would literally give birth, get the check, and throw the baby in the trash and get pregnant again. I am not paying for that.    Tell you what. If you want this, lets go to the mods and ask for a rule that anything that happens after birth is off limits on this sub. No more PCs saying that PLs don't care what happens after birth, because it is not about abortion and banned. Or is this a silly thing to say? I hope my point is getting clearer.""]"

""Since before the bankruptcy proceedings, Mr Bankman and Ms Fried have been seeking to return the deed to the company and are awaiting further instructions,"" the spokesperson said, declining to elaborate.  It had been known that FTX and its employees bought real estate in the Bahamas, where it established its headquarters in September last year.  But these property records seen by Reuters show for the first time the scale of their buying spree and the intended use of some of the real estate.  FTX, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this month after a rush of customer withdrawals, did not respond to a request for comment. Bankman-Fried did not respond to requests for comment.  Bankman-Fried has told Reuters he lived in a house with nine other colleagues. For his employees, he said FTX provided free meals and an ""in-house Uber-like"" service around the island.  The collapse of FTX, one of the world\'s largest crypto currency exchanges, has left an estimated 1 million creditors facing losses totalling billions of dollars.  **Reuters has reported Bankman-Fried secretly used $10 billion in customer funds to prop up his trading business, and that at least $1 billion of those deposits had vanished.**  In a US court filing with the District of Delaware bankruptcy court earlier this month, John Ray, FTX\'s new chief executive, said he understood that corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to ""purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors.""  **Reuters could not determine the source of funds that FTX and its executives used to buy these properties.**  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   END QUOTE - more at the link.

Additionally, since 1992 the land requirement for human settlements has more than doubled worldwide; and humanity has rendered 23 percent of Earth's land ecologically degraded and no longer usable. Industrial farming is considered to be one of the major contributors to this decline. Around 25% of the planet's ice-free land is being used to rear cattle for human consumption.  Those are staggering statistics. All the habitat destruction in clearing land is going to have an impact on biodiversity.  If everyone shifted to a plant-based diet we would reduce global land use for agriculture by 75%. This large reduction of agricultural land use would be possible thanks to a reduction in land used for grazing and a smaller need for land to grow crops. (https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets)   Rewilding this land would solve much of the biodiversity crisis and help with climate change.

Here are some thoughts I've had about them.  1. Hiring still happens under market socialism. It's just that when you do get hired somewhere, you are generally then invited to participate in a democratic decision-making process. How exactly *that* would unfold will likely depend to a great extent on the nature of the business and likely require a degree of regulation to ensure that it is fair and equitable. Some very small businesses may be able to be run on pure consensus basis, while others would need to have some sort of electoral structure so that people can consent to upper levels of management who have significant authority delegated to them.  2. Starting a new business is I think one of the trickiest things to make sure to get right and one of the clearest ways that capitalism has some clear advantages. If you have the money and will, it's pretty straightforward to hire people as you need. Obviously this gets more complicated under a system of worker control because, well, for all it's benefits democracy requires a lot more care to get right.   The first thing to point out is that under a socialist system, many if not most businesses will likely start off as collective endeavors. Under my personal conception of how this could work, people with shared interests and a desire to make money will get together form an enterprise via a legal structure (similar to incorporating a business) to which they will then loan either money or assets to be paid back over time with interest ‚Äî thus providing a personal incentive to risk their own money. From this point, the business will grow pretty much as a normal business does.  I think it would also be reasonable to provide additional incentives for founders if necessary in the form of a limited right to a permanent claim on profits or to provide for businesses below a certain size (say 5 employees) to be operated on a traditional capitalist model.  It's also worth noting that freelance work and sole proprietorships (provided they have a single worker-owner) are still allowed."", 'Sure, just bear in mind this is a reddit post and these ideas are non-exhaustive nor are they in some way fundamental to all conceptions of even market socialism.  1. There are lots of structures you may think about adopting ‚Äî from a pure consensus model at very small scales to structures that resemble representative democracy for very large organizations. These could be enforced by establishing a set of minimum criteria (for example requiring approval votes for leadership to occur at a minimum frequency or when leadership wants to take particular courses of action) or by producing a set of boilerplate structures (similar to the way different types of corporate structures exist now) to which a business agrees to adhere when it is chartered. You would probably want to provide some mechanism as well to adopt different structures following different rules so that a business is able to adapt as it grows. Among these choices, you might choose to adopt a system whereby equal vote shares are allocated per person or give varying weights based on tenure, hours worked in a given period or some other reasonable criteria.   2. First of all, I would like to provide incentives to make it easier for co-operative businesses to *start out as co-operatives* (as we do with small businesses now), but I think it would be reasonable to provide some wiggle room for truly small scale enterprises like that that want to grow. One thought I had along these lines was to provide some small number of additional votes for people with sole proprietorships who want to hire a few additional workers.  For example if the founder of a machine shop in your example decided to hire some help, you might give the founder 5 votes (plus tiebreaking authority) and each additional employee a single vote. This way, they can\'t possibly be outvoted on any given decision until they have hired a 6th employee ‚Äî and even then only if the other workers are unanimous in their dissent ‚Äî with that authority slowing dwindling down to having little value as the business grows.  3. As for ""tyranny of the majority"" I\'m not sure why this should be any greater of a concern than the tyranny of the minority we have now, but if such circumstances do indeed become problematic, then it would be the duty of the government to step in and regulate the markets just as it does now. Did you have any specific concerns in mind about ""moral hazards""? I\'m trying to think of anything that would be present in a democratic worker cooperative that wouldn\'t be present in a traditional capitalist structure and am drawing a blank.', 'The idea is that what work is necessary and what work is not would simply be decided on through a conscious and transparent process by the association of workers, not dictated by the needs of capital. In socialism there also is no money and no ""circulation"" of goods since products are not distributed by means of exchange. Instead, all means of production are held in common by an association of workers. Together they decide (in full self-awareness, with complete transparency) what needs require work and how the work will be shared.   There would no longer be any such thing as a ""wealthy person"" in the sense of a person with an extraordinary amount of ""purchasing power"" who can command large quantities of other people\'s labor on a whim; society will be classless, and the relation between your direct contribution of labor and your direct receipt of product will be the same as mine, unlike today where Jeff Bezos can earn a new car in 0.01 seconds while the same car might represent 2000 hours of work by some barista.  Products in socialism are not bought and sold. They are not made for alienated needs but rather for human needs. Rather than being an expression of their alienated need for money, work will be an expression of the workers\' human need for human society.  While mass redistribution in a commodity-production-based society is sure to cause economic problems until capital accumulation can be re-established, that only goes to show the inherent insanity of capitalism. It\'s also *not* because the economy of luxury goods is firewalled from the rest of the economy; that\'s just absurd. Rich people might buy very different cars then ordinary people. But those cars are manufactured using machines. The machines might not be exactly the same machines as the machines that make ordinary cars for non-rich people. But the owners of the machines, who make luxury cars, are not themselves interested in conspicuous consumption but in making the given luxury product as efficiently as possible. So their machines will in many cases be reconfigured versions of the ordinary machines. They will in many cases require the same parts. And in many cases the raw materials and other inputs to the production of luxuries are not themselves luxury products. The homes wealthy people commission are not ordinary homes, but the cement that pours their foundation is ordinary cement. The luxury economy bleeds into the rest of the economy through countless pores, they aren\'t firewalled at all. In order to produce the luxury goods, capitalists who cater to the wealthy make use of the same market means to obtain their inputs as anyone else. Besides, masses of non-wealthy people also consume luxury goods. There\'s no such thing as a commodity that has a sign on it, ""no poors allowed to buy"". Things can be bought by anyone willing to spend the money. So, while a wealthy person might by 100 PS5s to hand out as Christmas gifts to every distant relative, a poor person can still save and scrimpt until they can buy their own PS5. Middle-class people buy expensive shoes, watches, cigars, and cars; they just have to save a lot longer to afford even one unit, or use pay longer (with credit).']"

Hell, the fact that a writer keeps consistent with his worldbuilding is already enhancement of the story. There are problems with diversity inclusions in different shit because they obviously serve no purpose besides tokenism. No one bats an eye that a world is filled with different diverse people if it has been established from the beginning to be like that. But adding black dwarves and elves to Middle Earth, which is supposed to mirror pretty closely medieval Europe raises the eyebrows because it immediately brings to light worldbuilding questions. No one cares in star wars or in worlds where this has been established to just be the case, people get especially salty when a character who they know is changed or if it goes directly against worldbuilding.', 'Wrong. Why are white man the standard and anyone different have to enhance the story? Why we need a justification to have diverse characters? That being said I don‚Äôt give a shit about diversity. I just want a good story.', 'I know this is a side track but I‚Äôd also argue there‚Äôs a number of situations where the same could be said for original characters.  Without diversifying writing, directing, and production staff, we increasingly see situations where new media is created with diverse characters written by the same old storytellers.   This has led to a situation (IMO) of almost surreptitious co-opting/colonization of diverse characters.   This is especially true when people call out the lack of diversity in shows where lack of diversity may be an important context.   An example: there was some criticism of the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, a show focused on affluent Jews in 1950s NYC, for not featuring a diverse cast expected from NYC-based shows. However, the push for the white show creators to just write some POC characters is both baffling in terms of appropriate representation of POC narratives but also because the lack of POC visibility is absolutely in-keeping with the perspective of the protagonists. It actually *tells* us something about racism and segregation and ethnic insularity that there *isn‚Äôt* diversity in the show - shoehorning it in provides a sense that the characters being presented had awareness, consciousness, or sympathies that may be ahistorical and subsequently produce a whitewashed outcome solely designed to comfort modern viewers.  So I‚Äôd say that even with original characters, story should rule - white creators are often not the best people to write non-white characters and not every setting is an appropriate context for the inclusion of diversity that obfuscates the reality of the experiences of ‚Äúdiverse people‚Äù.   We shouldn‚Äôt encourage diversity in every story, we should encourage more support for diverse creators who will naturally create more diverse work.']

No gymnastics here, no fairy tale stories about God, consequences, natural events, and killing innocent person to stop the killer. It's funny when pro-lifers think that every pregnancy complication comes from nowhere and the fetus has nothing to do with it. After conception an embryo sends special hormones to a woman's body to control it and make a woman's body the better place for itself. These changes cause pregnancy complications. Dying fetus causes sepsis. Growing fetus causes uterine rupture, perineal tear and massive bleeding. Abnormally developing embryo cells cause choriocarcinoma, which metastasizes to the mother's brain or lungs. You don't really know how pregnancy works, right?""]"

You say I am incorrect but then make a lengthy explanation that seemingly only shows how you don't disagree with me.  If we talk about heat/energy transfer due to thermal radiation, then the net energy/heat transfer is indeed from hot to cold. I agree.   But I am not talking about heat/energy transfer due to thermal radiation.   I am talking about energy transfer due to non-thermal radiation. Then the net energy transfer can be from a cold object to a warm object.   So, how do you think I am incorrect?"", 'I trust that we\'re aligned in broad terms, but the way you made your argument was technically wrong. Let\'s look at what you wrote...   GHE ""backradiation"" absolutely IS thermal radiation. (It\'s true that it\'s not ""black body radiation""; but almost all thermal radiation radiating from real materials differs somewhat from black body radiation.) It\'s entirely made by ""heat radiating from \\[matter\\] at a certain temperature.""   I\'m not sure what distinction you\'re trying to make; it seems like your statement applies equally to all radiation emitted by any type of matter.   No, when I worked as a physicist, I specialized in lasers, i.e., in non-thermal radiation. Back-radiation is unquestionably thermal radiation.   Not really, though that\'s a popular misconception.  On average, a CO2 molecule in the appropriate excited state takes about 1 second to emit a photon. But, that molecule experiences several billion collisions each second.  So, when a CO2 molecule absorbs an IR photon, putting it into an excited state, there will almost always be a collision before the CO2 molecule can emit a photon.  How, then, do photons get emitted? Occasionally collisions put a CO2 molecule into an excited state, and occasionally that leads to a photon being emitted. This is purely a process in which the thermal motion of molecules leads to photons being emitted. It\'s the epitome of a thermal radiation emission process.   No, a cold object can warm a warmer object via non-thermal radiation (e.g, from a laser), but that\'s not possible with thermal radiation.  But, the whole argument about GHE back-radiation is misguided, involving a misinterpretation of how the GHE works.  Back-radiation to the ground does not ""warm"" the ground in any direct way. Certainly, there is no heat flowing from the air to the ground. Rather, the backradiation forms the smaller of the two terms in the heat transfer equation, and it thereby reduces the rate at which radiant heat flows upward away from the surface.  The GHE doesn\'t ""warm"" the surface in the way that most people think. Rather, it reducing the efficiency of planetary cooling. That leads to more thermal energy from sunlight accummalating, which is what DOES warm the surface. Once the surface gets warm enough, it\'s higher temperature will lead to more heat flowing to space despite the reduced efficiency of heat transport to space. Eventually, equilibrium is found, at a higher temperature than would be the case if there wasn\'t an impediment to cooling.  ^ ^ ^  In my view, trying to argue that backradiation can warm the surface just adds to the general level of confusion about this topic.  Am I being at all clear?']"

Where this conversation was going was ""well we\'re all sinners so does [this] sin even matter?"" Views that make light of sin always lead to sin .It\'s been the same discussion for almost 2 thousand years now. ""Well wouldn\'t more sin mean more grace?"" Paul responds to this in Romans 6.

Christ paid a high price with his own blood and suffering. The word excruciating was created to describe the unimaginable pain of literally tearing your body apart as you fight to take a breath (the cross actually kills by asphyxiation). He gave everything to put an end to sin. He expects people to respect the gravity of the situation   But yes all sin can be redeemed but twisting scripture to make certain sins look less dangerous only leads to dangerous places.

It\'s as if they have reasoned, a priori, that I must be wrong and therefore no evidence is needed to prove it. You\'re wrong because we\'ve defined you as wrong.', 'I perfectly understand the premise of the book; what is not being understood are my criticisms of Hoppe.

I mean sure, anyone can make a compelling argument for anything as long as they include only favorable evidence and ignore all the contrary evidence.    What does it say about a thought experiment that basically *none* of Hoppe\'s reasoning is borne out in practice? He has all these elaborate and logical chain of reasoning to explain why ""private governance"" under a monarch would lead to better outcomes than ""public governance"" under democracy, and yet *real world evidence doesn\'t support his theorizing.*  For example, he claims that monarchs would have high time preference and therefore a strong incentive to increase the productivity of their subjects; in the real world, there is no evidence of this occurring. In fact, monarchies tended to be the strongest proponents of mercantilism and tightly controlled domestic markets. Modern capitalism wasn\'t invented in a European monarchy, it was invented in the Dutch Republic in the 1600s, and the first country to adopt capitalism outside of the Netherlands was England at a time when the monarchy was historically weak (post Glorious Revolution in 1688) and well on its way to being nothing more than a symbolic figurehead.   Or what, might I ask, would Hoppe make of the Belgian Congo? The King of Belgium claimed Congo as his own personal, ""private property"". Is this not the ""private government"" under a monarch which Hoppe says is preferable to democracy? Why then were conditions in the Belgian Congo so much worse under the King of Belgium than in colonies controlled by democratic countries like France and the UK? (not to say things were all sunshine and rainbows in, say, Kenya or French West Africa, but they weren\'t even close to as terrible as what happened in the Belgian Congo)   And almost all of those alliances and treaties were made by monarchies. WWI started when the Serbian Monarchy, with the backing of the Russian Monarchy, murdered the heir to throne of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, which then chose to launch a war because they had the backing of the German Monarchy, and the German monarchy in turn expanded the war when they chose to invade France (a democratic country) despite the French government having basically no involvement in the July Crisis which immediately preceded the outbreak of war. This German invasion of France and Belgium in turn triggered British involvement---the only democratic country to voluntarily join WWI in 1914.   So which democratic country am I forgetting, specifically? At the very least, WWI shows that monarchies are just as susceptible to bad foreign policy (entangling treaties and alliances) as democracies; at worst, the fact that the outbreak of WWI was caused by monarchies is a damning indictment of monarchy. And Hoppe completely ignores this obvious read of the historical evidence. As you say:   So why then is Hoppe trying to pin the blame for WWI on democracy?', 'Read Hoppe please']"

More to the point though, what Adam Smith proposed is not what we'd consider to be capitalism today nor did it fully inform capitalism even at the time Marx wrote his works on it.  However, Marx certainly read Smith and much of socialism emerged to address many of the drawbacks that people like Adam Smith could predict resulting with the industrious division of labor and wealth, but that he could not have entirely foreseen as he was writing before the industrial revolution.  However, socialists and socialist writers were not opposed to capitalism. It was a necessary development for organization of industry which was the true source of prosperity. Socialism, for them, was a necessary evolution for capitalism so that the society could achieve the benefits that were promised by writers like Smith.

HIV- A Virus Like No Other. http://theperthgroup.com/HIV/TPGVirusLikeNoOther.pdf  IS HIV THE CAUSE OF AIDS? An interview with Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos By Christine Johnson Continuum Autumn 1997 http://virusmyth.com/aids/hiv/cjinterviewep.htm  **Robert Gallo is a fraud** https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html  Dr. Peter Duesberg states:  ‚ÄúFor them to justify their existence and their expenses, and make their careers they have to find infectious diseases.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe more diseases that they could lump into this AIDS syndrome, ‚ÄòS‚Äô stands for Syndrome, the better the chances are they get patients under that umbrella. The more patients they could catch.‚Äù  **PCR inventor Kary Mullis writes:**   ‚ÄúIn 1988 I was working as a consultant at Specialty Labs in Santa Monica, CA, setting up analytic routines for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). **I knew a lot about setting up analytic routines for anything with nucleic acids in it because I invented the Polymerase Chain Reaction. That\'s why they hired me.**     Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), on the other hand, was something I did not know a lot about. Thus, when **I found myself writing a report on our progress and goals for the project, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, I recognized that I did not know the scientific reference to support a statement I had just written: ""HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.""**     **So I turned to the virologist at the next desk, a reliable and competent fellow, and asked him for the reference. He said I didn\'t need one.** I disagreed. While it\'s true that certain scientific discoveries or techniques are so well established that their sources are no longer referenced in the contemporary literature, that didn\'t seem to be the case with the HIV/AIDS connection. **It was totally remarkable to me that the individual who had discovered the cause of a deadly and as-yet-uncured disease would not be continually referenced in the scientific papers until that disease was cured and forgotten.** But as I would soon learn, the name of that individual - who would surely be Nobel material - was on the tip of no one\'s tongue.‚Äù   ‚ÄúAfter ten or fifteen meetings over a couple years, I was getting pretty upset when no one could cite the reference. I didn\'t like the ugly conclusion that was forming in my mind: The entire campaign against a disease increasingly regarded as a twentieth century Black Plague was based on a hypothesis whose origins no one could recall. That defied both scientific and common sense.     **Finally, I had an opportunity to question one of the giants in HIV and AIDS research, DL Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute,** when he gave a talk in San Diego. It would be the last time I would be able to ask my little question without showing anger, and I figured Montagnier would know the answer. So I asked him.     **With a look of condescending puzzlement, Montagnier said, ""Why don\'t you quote the report from the Centers for Disease Control? ""**     **I replied, ""It doesn\'t really address the issue of whether or not HIV is the probable cause of AIDS, does it?""**     **‚ÄùNo,"" he admitted, no doubt wondering when I would just go away.** He looked for support to the little circle of people around him, but they were all awaiting a more definitive response, like I was.     **‚ÄùWhy don\'t you quote the work on SIV [Simian Immunodeficiency Virus]?"" the good doctor offered.**     **‚ÄùI read that too, DL Montagnier,"" I responded. ""What happened to those monkeys didn\'t remind me of AIDS. Besides, that paper was just published only a couple of months ago. I\'m looking for the original paper where somebody showed that HIV caused AIDS.**     This time, DL **Montagnier\'s response was to walk quickly away to greet an acquaintance across the room.‚Äù**     ‚ÄúWe have not been able to discover any good reasons why most of the people on earth believe that AIDS is a disease caused by a virus called HIV. There is simply no scientific evidence demonstrating that this is true.     We have also not been able to discover why doctors prescribe a toxic drug called AZT (Zidovudine) to people who have no other complaint other than the fact that they have the presence of antibodies to HIV in their blood. In fact, we cannot understand why humans would take this drug for any reason.‚Äù  http://www.duesberg.com/viewpoints/kintro.html']"

Basically, cows only produce milk right after having given birth to a calf, as the milk is specifically for the calf. So in order to get them to produce milk, they have to masturbate a bull and collect its semen, and then use it to impregnate a cow, usually with a turkey baster or something similar. Once the calf is born they take it away from the mother, if it's female they raise it as another dairy cow and if it's male they kill it-sometimes for veal, sometimes they just scrap it. This is more efficient for factory farms(and some normal farms even) which means they can produce more milk and get more profits etc. This isn't something they tend to do on beef farms, which is why I specify this to milk""]"

They literally have a proportionate amount of representation.   And it wouldn‚Äôt create any power ‚Äúimbalance‚Äù to elect the president by a popular vote. Every American would be exactly equal. But I gather you think that‚Äôs the problem? I mean, ok. But there‚Äôs no particular reason we‚Äôd have to change anything else about our federal system if we switched to a popular vote. You think there‚Äôd have to be some other change to prevent Americans from having a more equal voice in their government? I don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôd be necessary.   And also, the real problem with the Electoral College isn‚Äôt a slight bias to small states. Most small states are totally irrelevant to the outcome. No one cares about voters in Montana because they won‚Äôt affect the outcome. The problem is it‚Äôs winner-take-all in almost all states, and as a result, only a handful of swing states really matter. Imagine we kept electoral votes the same, but awarded them proportionally (and it could be awarded in fractions of a vote, to the millionth decimal place or something like that), that would solve most of the problems of the Electoral College. But at that point, you really might as well just have a popular vote.', 'The same system causes both. Because it\'s winner-takes-all for electoral college votes, states with clear majorities are worthless to campaign within regardless of their population, so every candidate spends most of their time and effort on the states that are actually undecided. Only about 10 states are considered reasonably likely to flip, and of those only about 2 end up actually close enough to matter in any particular election. Moving such a state by 2% can shift the election by an entire state worth of votes as a result.  However, electoral college votes are not assigned to states purely by population. There\'s a population-based amount, then they get an extra 2 as bonus on top. And it happens to be that the low population states almost universally end up going to the same party every election, giving that party additional electoral votes relative to their popular vote.  In other words, there isn\'t some big ""gotcha"" moment here like you seem to think there is. That ""contradiction"" you seem to be implying is exactly how the electoral college works and what it results in, and that\'s why people don\'t like it.  Switching to popular vote not only prevents unpopular candidates from winning by manipulating the system, it also means that *every* state must receive attention because every vote shifted matters no matter where it is, rather than having 40/50 states not matter at all to presidential candidates.', "" I just want to point out this is a meaningless idea and possible quite wrong.  We have *never* had a single nationwide popular vote election in the US for President. There is zero reason to assume you can take vote totals for an electoral college election, which is really just statewide popular vote elections to allocate state electors, and claim those votes would be representative for a true popular vote election nationwide.  We know voter behavior and campaign behavior would be different in a popular vote election.  Why would you expect the vote totals to be the same as the electoral college election?  Along those same lines, the claim of a vote being worth different amounts is equally wrong. Your vote in California for president is worth the exact same as every other vote in California for president. You only get a say in how California allocates it's electoral votes. You vote in California has NO bearing on what Wyoming does. A voter in Wyoming's vote is exactly equal to every other voter in Wyoming and totally worthless in California. A voter is voting as a resident of a STATE first and foremost. That state then in turns allocated votes for the President.

Women (in the West) have it better than men. There are so many double standards that benefit women and not men.

Even if many rape allegations end up being bullshit, men who are falsely accused end up getting fucked socially, legally and in their employment opportunities. They basically get cancelled from society. If the allegation is real, sure they deserve it for their actions but if it‚Äôs not they still are affected.   3.

There are laws to protect these issues. And what you are saying is anecdotal, no stats to back it up. Does it happen? Maybe. Can it be prevented or take legal action. Also, yes.   Gender pay gap is a myth. Women work less hours (not a lot of OT), take more sick pay, more vacations, and have to take family leave in most cases due to pregnancies (unfortunately).. Also, gender pay gap allegations do not take into account different industries. More men are in higher paying industries like infrastructure, STEM, the trades than their women counterparts.   You‚Äôre probably going to say: ‚Äúwomen don‚Äôt join these fields because something something men‚Äù. No it‚Äôs because they chose not to. College attendances are like 60:40 in favor of women yet men are still dominating STEM fields. It‚Äôs a matter of choice. There are literally affirmative action programs that give women so many resources and support to go to STEM or any other male dominated field.   Go to tech though, companies like Google, Twitter etc and you‚Äôll see that they hire more women than men, and also women average salaries are higher, but we‚Äôre not ready for that discussion are we?   4. Yes', 'You‚Äôre  very confused and both underestimate law enforcement while simultaneously diminishing commonenes and ignoring FACTS. First, men and women experience domestic violence differently. Secondly, the majority of domestic homicide victims (killed by ex/partner or a family member) is 80% female. Of the suspects 96% Were male. Of the 20% of male victims of domestic homicide, the suspect was female 38% of the time.  I LIVE IN THE STATE WITH THE HIGHEST DEATH RATE OF WOMEN KILLED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE . It‚Äôs pathetic how men are no longer men', 'The ""women are wonderful"" effect is a good example of what I\'m talking about, actually. In theory, the ""women are wonderful"" effect *could* translate into significant real-world preferential treatment: for example, it could mean that women should be in charge because of course you\'re going to put the best, least corruptible people in charge. In real life, that\'s not the case; it does not seem to translate into preferential treatment, and in fact often the opposite. In the case of sexual assault (since you bring it up), many women are ""believed"" but still blamed; [studies have shown that people do engage in more victim-blaming for rape](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20587449/) than other crimes. Seeing women as morally superior doesn\'t seem to translate into taking crimes against them more seriously--in fact, only *less* seriously. Being seen as morally superior may just mean being held more responsible even for what other people do. Not an actual benefit.  One thing that I think will help to understand about the positive/negative stereotype thing is that most people don\'t really have well-thought-out, internally consistent systems of belief. Instead, they have a haphazard collection of socially accepted commonplaces, post hoc justifications, and random thoughts that occur to them one day that are often the result of confirmation bias and convenience, which are then doled out when the relevant social situations arise. These are not only random but also often even quite contradictory and nonsensical when taken together. So people don\'t actually, consistently over time believe that men are bumbling idiots; they don\'t hold it as a consistent principle. Who would put the bumbling idiots in charge of every major institution for thousands of years? People\'s real beliefs and values are in their actions. This is why I recommend thinking about the *function* of beliefs over their *content*.  (As an aside, re: the bumbling idiot thing specifically, [men report being labeled incompetent because of their gender in the workplace about one-fourth as often as women do (6% vs 23%)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/12/14/gender-discrimination-comes-in-many-forms-for-todays-working-women/). So, not something that shows up IRL or inhibits men\'s ability to provide for themselves to a significant degree.)  As for group solidarity and identification, I think you\'ve got it backwards; this is something men have plenty of. (Keep in mind that ""solidarity"" and ""identification"" are different from emotional closeness or intimacy.) For example, [one study showed that while men and women had equal empathy for a hypothetical rape victim, men had higher empathy for the perpetrator](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-08-victim-blamers-empathy-perpetrators.html).  Women having stronger social support networks than men is also a relatively recent phenomenon and probably a product of women entering the public sphere more fully. In most if not all patriarchal societies, the domestic confinement of women was common and women were not able to mix with other women to the same degree that men could mingle with each other. It\'s reasonable to think that relegation to the ""private sphere"" cut off a lot of women\'s connections to each other and reduced group identification.  A little further afield, but you might look at our closest relatives: chimpanzees and bonobos. Chimps have a ""male-dominant"" society where complex hierarchies of power are maintained through violence and male chimps often work in concert with each other while female chimps are ""divided"" and do not seem to have the same group mentality, working individually instead. In contrast, bonobos have a ""female-dominant"" society where the opposite is true: female bonobos have a strong sense of group solidarity or ""coalition formation"" while the male bonobos act more as individuals. It\'s the reason bonobos, unlike chimps, don\'t have rape: although male bonobos attempt it, female bonobos quickly come to each other\'s aid, while the male bonobos do not. Historically, human societies have been much more like those of chimps than bonobos.']"

So your idea, while certainly a good one, only really works for a specific and uncommon subset of individuals: those who are skilled developers, but don‚Äôt have a good amount of industry experience or a college degree.   Unrelated to the CMV: If you have the skill but you‚Äôre having trouble with getting past the automated screening, you should still put your 2-year degree in the ‚Äúeducation‚Äù section and then fill your ‚Äúrelevant experience‚Äù with 10 years worth of projects or whatever you‚Äôve worked on.

A lot of industries have hiring freezes, and the ones that don‚Äôt are lowballing potential candidates because they know that the number of candidates is much larger than the number of jobs available.   To stay up-to-date on hiring practices, I apply to a couple places every few months and interview with them to see what kinds of questions get asked. Recently, I did well in a technical round for a Senior Software Engineer position at a company out of state; I got an offer letter, and they offered me $96K, *knowing* that I currently make $130K in a relatively LCOL area. I‚Äôm not saying that to brag; I‚Äôm saying that because it‚Äôs ridiculous, but companies know that engineers are desperate to find better places to work, especially remote positions, and they‚Äôre capitalizing on that right now', 'A lot of it depends on what you want to do. I‚Äôm a full stack dev, but I used to work on a standalone app in C#, and before that, I used to be a Linux Systems Engineer. Good technical skills to have as a junior to mid level full stack developer, in no particular order:  ‚Ä¢ \u2060Fundamental knowledge of memory management/memory allocation (this includes understanding the stack vs the heap and which is allocated when) ‚Ä¢ \u2060Understanding of containers vs VMs, and the differences between the two ‚Ä¢ \u2060Understanding of version control (I don‚Äôt care if you use Git, SVN, or even Bazaar; just show me you know how to use it) ‚Ä¢ \u2060Understanding recursion ‚Ä¢ \u2060Being able to sort/manage arrays * Basic Linux knowledge (if you can show me cd and ls, that‚Äôs good enough; we‚Äôll fill in the rest later) * Understanding of OOP (Classes, attributes, methods, access modifiers, difference between class and object, interfaces)  Knowledge that is nice to have, but not required:  ‚Ä¢ \u2060Knowledge of data structures ‚Ä¢ \u2060Knowledge of GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, or some other pipeline management tool ‚Ä¢ \u2060Knowledge of Ansible or Puppet ‚Ä¢ \u2060Fundamental knowledge of networking (IP addresses, static vs DHCP, NAT, load balancing, etc.) * Intermediate Linux knowledge such as package management, basic shell scripting, sed/awk, vim/nano (preferably vim but I‚Äôll take emacs or even ed if that‚Äôs what you know), file concatenation and manipulation  Things that make you a fantastic candidate: * Understanding dynamic programming  * Knowing what an inode is * Being able to explain how a pointer works as if I‚Äôm your tech-illiterate grandpa * Understanding the Kerberos workflow * Understanding the OAUTH 2 flow, and understanding what an access token is and what an ID token is * Understanding application security (how to harden your application) * Understanding how to architect a three-tier application    I don‚Äôt care what language the interviewer knows. If they‚Äôre writing their whiteboard problems in pseudocode, that works for me. I just want to know that they can gain an understanding of a problem and attempt to solve it  Regarding your second question, I hire significantly on personality. If someone isn‚Äôt as knowledgeable but shows that they‚Äôre humble and willing to learn, I‚Äôll take them over someone who knows a lot but is arrogant any day. I‚Äôve never regretted hiring someone less skilled with a good attitude, but I have regretted hiring a skilled engineer that was unable to admit they were wrong.', 'Good question! So the hardest part, if you have technical skill but no 4-year degree, is to get past the resume screen. This is typically done by a recruiter or HR, and they typically see a resume without a college degree and want to toss it because they‚Äôre boomers who don‚Äôt know that people can have technical skill without college.   You can try to get past it by putting relevant experience. If you‚Äôve created any web apps or standalone applications, put them in the ‚Äúrelevant experience‚Äù section of your resume. Something like  * May 2018-July 2018: Built an e-commerce website that had the capacity to facilitate 300,000 transactions per day * October 2018-March 2020: Built a file sharing website that gave users the ability to upload and download a variety of different files  Once you get into the interview phase, they‚Äôll ask about these. First, talk about your architecture. If you used a VM on your machine and connected to it, say something like ‚ÄúI used VMware Fusion and ran a RHEL 8 server which hosted the application. Networking-wise, I bridged the server with my laptop‚Äôs network card, and hosted the application on my local network at first. Once I verified that that was functional, I opened the port on my router and forwarded it to my laptop, which forwarded traffic on that port to my VM, which server up the website to any clients that connected to my public IP.   Then, talk about your app: ‚ÄúI used Python and FastAPI and hosted it with Hypercor ‚Äù or ‚ÄúI used PHP and hosted it with Nginx‚Äù. Talk about any routes you used, and what your app does specifically. ‚ÄúI have a health route that can be tied to a load balancer to make sure the app is healthy. I also have a downloadFile route that takes a file name as a parameter and returns the file as a byte stream. This way, the full file is not loaded in memory at once. The byte stream is sent to the client, which is then downloaded as a file to the client‚Äôs filesystem.‚Äù  Finally, make sure to talk in detail about any challenges you faced and how you overcame them. As an interviewer, I want to hear those above all else. Also, talk about mistakes you made and how you fixed them. I‚Äôve worked in the industry long enough to know that anyone who says they haven‚Äôt made any mistakes either hasn‚Äôt worked in industry long enough to make any, or is too proud to admit them.   Overall, good luck! If you‚Äôre going the self-taught route, it‚Äôs hard because it requires a lot of discipline, but if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre passionate about, just take it one concept at a time, and it‚Äôll add up before you know it!']

Longevity is a goal mark in many proposals we receive. A proposal is the criteria thresholds manufacturers would like to achieve.   Very often, products would like to meet a use scenario of X quantity. This is usually in excess of what consumers would use the item.     For example, many washing machine manufacturers would like to hit a usability of around 1500 loads of laundry at a minimum. With many EU and US regional models having PRLs around twice that. That would be around 3x that average number of uses for that product yearly.   When manufacturers fall short of these proposals, they redesign the product usually. Like Samsung did when LG started making better models.   Some things are designed to be cheap/disposable. Yes. To be frank, it is obviously so too.   Such as many Sony loud speakers are very cheaply made and sold at a way lower price point than other products from, say Mackie, Fluence or Klipsch.   However, it is accurate to say many people not familiar with product testing and research have a somewhat fantastical view of planned obsolescence.    A Ninja blender being sold for $100 that does10 things is not the same product as a $800 Vitamix. A cosumer may just think they are two blenders, but that's not the way to look at it."", 'The average is around 300 loads a year in the US (I live and work in the US, but this varies by region). They shoot for a 5 year duration, 1500, and often double or triple that in the PRL. After a certain point, the engineers predict the product is unlikely to fail if it hasn\'t failed in 1500 cycles, hours uses, etc.   Certain models are made at different price points, sizes, and regulation standards by region. Often, they can\'t use X or Y components from one model to the next.  This partly is why they have different criteria per product or model for testing.  Most products will fail early in their use cycle, if at all. Generally,  manufacturers would like to not have to replace products or have their brand perceived to be low quality.   Most things will fail in time. Even ""old"" stuff made back in the day, so to speak, will eventually fail. Many of them did in their day as well- it\'s just a bias your grandma\'s old stove didn\'t break down, or your grandpa\'s old Monte Carlo ran perfectly for decades. That\'s the reality of physics, friction, material wear &amp; tear, etc.   Sometimes manufacturers don\'t care about longevity, absolutely yes.   Some products are made cheaply or quickly and not meant to last decades. Though many products are not desired to be cheap or low quality as they hurt the product brand or consumer confidence in the manufacturer.   Testing is done by customers/consumers in real scenarios when possible. The manufacturers like to test in phases; lab test, home use test, observed use, focus testing, etc.   Vitamix, Kitchenaid, Staub, AllClad, Breville Le Creuset, Matfer, Global, OXO, for example, all make kitchen related products that the engineers try to make as durable and long last as possible. Their PRLs are pretty hefty.   But even so, Le Creuset or Oxo also makes cheaper stuff at lower price points. This is made less durable, cheaper.   It\'s not accurate to say, ""Le Cresuset builds stuff to last generations,"" as is often claimed.    Planned obsolescence does happen. Though not to the degree often misunderstood or exaggerated by general consumers for a number of reasons not related to the actual products at times.', 'Well, the OP had cookware that cost thousands of bucks. As an example of ""long lasting"" products. Yeah, and they still make that cookware today, and yes, it will last generations. It will cost significantly.   That\'s just the reality of physics. It takes a lot to engineer products that last for a long time, usually. Not all these things are equal either.  A cast iron skillet is a relatively simple product. Technology might change the offerings of refrigerators, washing machines, or cellphones much more than a pan or light bulb.   I have old flip phones in the garage that still ""work."" But one might upgrade their phone for new features, form factor, newer hardware, etc.   When I was young we had an old fridge handed down from my grandmother that ran ""fine"". We upgraded to a new fridge with features such as an ice maker, a water dispenser, and so on. The old fridge went into the basement as a spare.   Many products cut corners in the service of greed, naturally. Though, quality products are still made today as in the past.  There were likely a lot of fridges of the same model type as my grandmother\'s old fridge that didn\'t last as long. Pointing to the one that didn\'t fail and assuming they all ran for decades without error is a bias.   There are factors like more things being made out of plastic, product complexity, user familiarity, and many items being more difficult to repair or service by laymen that feeds that bias as well.   My grandfather was a musician and made acoustic guitars. He also repaired them - people had high quality, expensive guitars, and cheap ones that needed more or less repairs back in the 60s and 70s as today.   My dad was a car mechanic. Cars broke down in the 70s and 80s.   My uncle owned a furniture repair business. Furtiniute broke down in the 60s and 70s, too.  The surviving products are not always indictive of greater attention to longevity than today. There is more to it than that. This is why I said earlier that consumers have an overexaggerated sense of ""planned obsolescence.""   Planned obsolescence is real. But that doesn\'t mean all products are such and a lot of them are made to last. But you might not find a saucepan sold at $10 will last the same as a $1000 Mauviel saucepan either.']"

Homosexuality was banned/discouraged in socialist nations because it was the medical consensus up until fairly recently that it was a disorder and liberal attitudes toward homosexuality are quite recent in the capitalist west. The DDR legalized gay sex in the late 1980‚Äôs, when anti sodomy laws were on the books and enforced in parts of the United States until 2003. More contemporary examples of attitudes changing in communist societies are Philippine communist rebels recognizing same sex marriage in the areas that they control in 2005 and Cuba enacting arguably the most progressive marriage/family laws in the world earlier this year.', ' It\'s my understanding that the partitions of Poland until 1918 imposed restrictions, and post WWI various penal codes from other states that criminalized it remained in place until that 1932 decision. (though I reserve the right to be wrong, Polish history isn\'t my most knowledgable topic). And again, you\'re really focusing on the earliest date in which homosexuality was decriminalized and not the qualitative changes that were made to better incorporate us into society. Yes, it was decriminalized in 32, but the rest of the progress was made during the years in which Poland was communist, and after the fall of Communism in Poland that progress was dismantled. Today, Poland does not recognize same sex marriages nor grants same sex civil unions, and approximately 1/3 of the country is made up of ""LGBT free zones"". Honestly I\'m glad you brought Poland up because it\'s such a perfect example of my point.', '(part 2, wouldn\'t let me post it all as one comment)   Ok, let\'s take a look at that picture:  During the McCarthy era in the 40s and 50s (and before, this was used against child labor laws and women\'s suffrage in the 30s as well) baseless accusations of being a communist became incredibly common, and deliberate attempts were made to get the public to associate various social movements with communism in an attempt to discredit them, whether or not those links were actually present. The state department took actions to remove communists and ""homosexuals"" in the red and lavender scares respectively, resulting in thousands losing their jobs with executive order 10450. McCarthy himself is quoted as saying ""If you want to be against McCarthy, boys, you\'ve got to be either a Communist or a cocksucker."" You could be interrogated and fired, or be one of the 20% of Americans who had to sign an oath attesting to your ""moral purity"" until at least 1958.  This led to the start of LGBT struggles in the 60s, with a protest at the whitehouse in 1965, then Stonewall in 1969. Stonewall birthed many LGBT groups that were explicitly socialist or supported socialist groups. The Gay Liberation Front was formed that same year. They had barrels of ink dumped on them and were beaten by the police in a demonstration that October. In 1970, two members of the GLF Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera (whose names you should recognize if you\'re familiar with stonewall) formed the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, and that same year also saw the founding of Lavender Menace. All three groups adopted socialist stances. Huey Newton of the Black Panther Party, notable socialist, publically voiced his support for the GLF after its founding.  Demonstrations and violent incidents continued throughout the 70s, notably one instance in LA in 79 where the police Vice Squad entered Pegs Place, shouted ""let\'s get the dykes"", and proceeded to beat the patrons. Then throughout the 80s there was the AIDS epidemic which was deliberately made worse by the Reagan administration, case numbers increased throughout the 90s and resulted in the deaths of thousands by its peak in 2004. While on paper that one specific law may not have been enforced, there were other legal restrictions that *were* enforced, and it\'s not like the USA was particularly good to LGBT people during this time outside of the law either.  I think you\'re too focused on the earliest date in which being gay is technically no longer illegal, and ignoring many of the other things that go into making society a place in which LGBT people are accepted and can thrive. While communist states weren\'t all perfect all of the time, it was socialism that was spearheading much of that crucial second part, they were doing it earlier than others at the time, and when non-socialist states adopted similar stances it was largely due to the work of socialists within those states.']"

Found this interesting bit: ""The proximate causes of most crashes are human behaviors including speeding, inattention, tailgating, impairment, improper passing, disobeying a signal, failing to yield right-of-way, or other infractions.""    This is a half truth, at best. Proximate causes can include equipment failure, road conditions, weather, sunrise/sunset blindness, etc.    But it also overlooks the fact that an accident can be a combination of behaviors of both drivers in a two car collision, or that someone can be in an accident where THE OTHER DRIVER IS SOLELY at fault. There was no information in here, that I recall seeing that accounted for the fact that two car\'s worth of drivers and passengers (and pedestrians) could have received emergency car for the same collision, and how the numbers might be skewed to account for who is at fault. (Eg. Car #1 with one vaccinated driver pulls out of a parking lot without checking the road first, and causes a car with 1 unvaxxed driver and two unvaxxed passengers to swerve and crash, while winging an unvaxxed pedestrian. All the unvaxxed people get care, while the vaxxed driver at fault is not recorded because he did not suffer injury.)    Found another nugget: It appears they pulled all the records as of July 31, 2021, so presumably the 30 day window was around that date. Over half the records available were excluded. Some, as previous commenters noted, were people who were dead, non-residents, etc. But a whopping 12% of those omitted were omitted for having ""no activity in the prior year"". IOW, if they were healthy enough to have avoided seeing a medical practioner in their home province, they were excluded.     More fun facts. Questionable ways of accounting for those that ""died at the scene"" and therefore were excluded and for those who may have been vaccinated subsequently:    ¬ß7 Accounting for Scene Deaths The study examined serious traffic crashes based on emergency care throughout the region and thereby did not include deaths at the scene. In turn, we considered extreme assumptions to examine how results might change based on these missing deaths. Specifically, traffic statistics for this setting (602 total deaths in Ontario, 2018) suggested that 50 total deaths might have occurred in our study during follow-up (602/12). Taking into account the 8 deaths that were included, therefore, we estimated potentially 42 total deaths at the scene (50‚àí8). Making an extreme assumption and assigning all these deaths to the vaccinated group yielded minimal changes to final results. In particular, the observed event count increased from a total of 5000 crashes to 5042 crashes, equivalent to an absolute risk of 535 per million (rather than 530 per million). This observed absolute risk was still substantially lower than the observed risk of 912 per million in the unvaccinated group. These results suggested that extreme assumptions about the deaths at the scene make minimal difference to final estimates of relative risk. ¬ß8 Accounting for Later Vaccinations The study examined vaccination status based on records on July 31, 2021 and did not include possible later vaccination that might have eventually occurred. In turn, we retrieved information on these subsequent vaccinations and considered extreme assumptions to examine how results might change based on the crossover cases. Specifically, we found 219,740 individuals who were eventually vaccinated from the cohort of 1,8450,290 who had been classified as unvaccinated. These individuals accounted for 155 total traffic crashes during follow-up. Making an extreme assumption and assigning all individuals to the vaccinated group yielded minimal changes to final results. In particular, the observed event count increased from a total of 5000 crashes to 5155 crashes, equivalent to an absolute risk of 534 per million (rather than 530 per million). This observed absolute risk was still substantially lower than the recalculated risk of 939 per million in the unvaccinated group. These results suggested that extreme assumptions about possible eventual vaccination during follow-up make minimal difference to final estimates of relative risk.']"

Unfortunately the nuanced answer is very long so please don\'t chastise me for omitting information for the sake of brevity, you\'re welcome to question me if you feel I\'m overlooking something.   Polygyny will increase in frequency as wealth inequality increases. Where I disagree with you is that you seem to imply people are opting to switch to polygyny because it\'s a ""better"" alternative to monogamy. Monogamy has worked historically because humans are sexually dimorphic primates that each play a certain roll. If human\'s were equally equipped to perform the same role, males and females would be indistinguishable from each other. It\'s a very recent phenomena that our modern day culture promotes the idea that men and women could fill the same roles, and by doing so they\'ve removed a lot of the incentive for men and women to pair up in the first place. Since women do not **need** a protector or provider, a male that does not offer what they need isn\'t needed for survival. Since they don\'t **need** men, the only men worth their time are those at the top of the dominance hierarchy. As it\'s happened a million times in the past, societies will rise and crumble. They rise when they do what works, and the crumble when they do what doesn\'t.  Now, what will happen is that women will increasingly become either single or polygamous and nationwide fertility will decline. This trend will continue until we reach a crisis point where there are far too many elderly for the young of the nation to support further accelerating the decline of a nation. Once a low enough population is reached, there will be a quick shift in the population. Your guess is as good as mine how evolution will handle that. Before we reach that crisis point we might vote for more ""traditional"" values, but I can\'t say whether or not that will actually happen.', ""But there are guys who are poly too, see pretty much all muslim cultures. As long as you're compatible and respect each other's boundaries, what's the issue? Love isn't a monolith and it isn't something limited. Some people can love multiple others romantically.  Poly relationships are way harder to maintain because while we may be able to love multiple other people, we don't have unlimited time to spend and bond with others, which will cause the partners to feel unloved and underappreciated, but it's nothing that can't be fixed with communication, trust, respect and some sacrifices for the sake of the relationship.  And you can be poly and still be in a monogamous relationship if you want, never breaking the boundaries of your partner, or you can be monogamous and cheat on your partner thus breaking their boundaries.     There can also be relationships formed of multiple people in relationship with each other, like 3+ people relationships, where they all love each other romantically."", 'Enforced monogomy does not necessarily mean polygamy, in fact that is rarely at issue. Instead in the modern day it‚Äôs hookup culture and the lopsided nature of hookup culture. There are men who do not get married and instead hookup with tons of girls and have an extremely high partner count. There is data on this such as partner count especially once corrected for only heterosexual counts and correcting for men who increase reported counts and women who reduce their reported counts. This then shows an interesting phenomenon of 50 percentile women having much higher partner counts than 50 percentile men. This is only possible by having the low and high ends be extreme for men, the high status men getting to the high hundreds and thousands and many men having low counts.  The changes to marriage up to and including the expectations for partner counts have also shifted that deal by amplifying this effect. There are more women who do not need to place as much value on a No or small partner count and as such but because there is also no restriction on the high status men who can achieve thousands in partner counts, even though there is more partner counts out there, it‚Äôs not being well distributed and instead being concentrated to a small percentage of men.  Now I would not even necessarily solely blame any of the sources you mentioned. Some of the larger culprits include larger cities and technology to make it easier to find more people. The more people one can reasonably meet outside of area restrictions means sexual selection can occur in a wider variety of people and as such people can select off more traits and as such sex will become less distributed.  There are many factors as to why sex and relationships are less distributed then before.']"

It creates migration and demographic pressure. Local municipalities regulate land use and haven't kept up. Big municipalities extract massive fees from developers. For example an accounting was done that showed by the time you develop a condo in Vancouver, you've said hundreds of thousands just in taxes, levies and fees. So one big problem is how land use is treated.  On the financial side, we've had very low interest rates for long periods of time, which has supported price escalation. Incomes have gone up, which sounds like good news, but it's not evenly spread. The winners are winning too much and the losers are losing badly. Overall things are better, but still very difficult for low income families. Now that rates are higher, it's harder to finance new housing. Our customers are having a harder time getting bank financing, making housing more inaccessible. It hasn't settled into what I'd call normal for decades.  When you get down to nuts and bolts, we have a massive replacement cost problem. There are shortages of everything, including trades. We have an ever expanding regulatory environment which dictates what you can build. Green requirements, accessibility requirements, and general design requirements have pushed cost. Wars, sanctions, the pandemic, and supply chains have all been a problem, driving up cost. When you can't build for a cheap price, you can't sell for one and make enough profit to get financing and capital. It pressures prices up, it makes adding supply very difficult. Even getting project insurance is a challenge because of industry capacity.  In summary we have more and more people crowding in and competing, and the government and industry has been unwilling or unable to respond. Housing has been going to the highest bidder, leaving a lot of people behind. Rental property is even harder to deliver, and renters are getting hit the hardest by escalation.

When in fact there was an existing welfare state that they dismantled.   ‚Äú Social services. Public welfare, largely under the jurisdiction of local and district authorities before 1933, was partly transferred by the Nazi government to affiliates of the Nazi party. Particularly to the Nationalsozailistiche Volkswohlfahrt (National Socialist People‚Äôs Welfare Organization‚ÄìNSV). The most important activity was the Winterhilfe (Winter Help), the distribution of money and goods among the poorest population. NSV was funded with a fee charged on the earnings of employed workers, and with quasi-compulsory levies in cash or in kind from farmers, peasants, employers and the middle classes generally (Guillebaud, 1941, pp. 96). Financial control of the Winter Help was in the hands of the Treasurer of the Nazi Party (Pollock, 1938, p. 164), and the compulsory character of the contributions was so clear that they have been 21 Pollock (1938, p. 43-68) provides an extensive revision of the organizational characteristics of the Nazi Party holding of organizations. 22 Nathan (1944a, p. 321) also points out that Education no longer remained the exclusive function of the public school system, but was shifted in part to the Hitler Youth Organization. 23 V√∂ltzer (135, pp. 4-6) offers a thorough revision of the German Labor Front legal configuration. 24 Besides, it also delivered new services such as the leisure program Strength through Joy (Kraft durch Freude). These are of less interest to our analytical purposes. 7   considered an additional source of fiscal revenues (Balogh 1938, 472). In 1933/34 the NSV realized 350 million marks, which in 1936/37 grew to 408.3 million marks (Pollock, 1938, p. 138; Guillebaud, 1941, pp. 97). Estimates in Nathan (1944b, p. 94) give figures of Rm. 340 in 1934/35 and 370 after 1937. Reichs-Kredit-Gesellschaft (1939, p. 101) gives an estimate of Rm. 400 million in 1938, according to official statistics. As explained in The Banker (1937, p. 171), the German government had provided Winter Help before the Nazi regime. A comparison between the expenditures of the Reich Winter Relief in 1931 and the Nazi Winter Relief in 1933 ‚Äúshows that this new Nazi organisation has not provided in Winter Help more than the former contribution made by the Reich alone....Under the Nazi system .... a huge apparatus has been created to carry out a service formerly provided as a ‚Äòside-line‚Äô by private and public bodies.‚Äù (p. 171). In short, delivered by private and public bodies before the Nazi regime, Winter Help was completely privatized by the Nazi government and was transferred to a Party Organization. The funding of the service was based on a compulsory scheme of fees and levies. Because of this, the Reich Budget was relieved of the expenditure implied by this social service program.‚Äù']"

Even if we paid every single American a fair, livable wage, there would still be a labor shortage without immigrants, legal or illegal.', ""The simple fact is that even if we were to fill to employ every single employable American, there will still be vacant jobs. I'm not sure what's difficult to understand here.   Not every economy/nation needs immigration to self-sustain but the US is dependent on it, whether or not you agree.   It says a lot about you that you think all immigrants go to the fields or whatever exploitable labor that you're thinking of. You realize that most engineering, medicine, and other high level roles need legal-immigrants from other countries and they are *still* understaffed? I say that as someone who has quite a lot of personal experience on that subject.   Regardless of how you feel, the nation still requires people to fulfill these roles and in many cases, easing the immigration process and more government oversight will help a lot of this. Aside from that, I don't know what the proper solution is but for you assume that the entire situation is black/white (immigrants are obviously low level employees ready to be exploited vs Americans can fulfill all jobs no matter what even though they arent enough to fill all vacant jobs) says a lot about your life experience. Research birth rates, job growth and labor shortages and start from there. Evne without our declining birth rates, the US has always relied on immigration to fill the labor gap throughout its entire history."", 'I\'m in a bit of a rush, so I can\'t respond to everything here.  The reason to care about legal immigration is because it also comes with a cap. Now, if you want to say there shouldn\'t be a cap, okay, but that\'s what is at stake when saying we shouldn\'t really care about illegal vs. legal.  Personally, I think the best compromise for expanding the cap is to have it come with a regional quota. First X however many get just a go-anywhere entry like we currently have. After that, we can say ""Montana hasn\'t taken its share yet. If you want in, there\'s a spot in Montana. We got a table for 4 in Montana. MONTANA! Who wants Montana?""  As for immigrants \'doing jobs Americans don\'t want to do,\' I just spent a couple years hearing how the labor shortage wasn\'t really a labor shortage, but rather companies not offering high enough wages to attract labor.  Saying Americans don\'t want the job is the start of the inquiry, not the end. Why don\'t they want the job? Is it because wages are too low? Well, letting employers fill the positions with low-wage laborers isn\'t the solution...   I\'d agree if they actually had to prove it. We do 65,000 H-1B visas a year. In how many of those cases do you really think the immigrant was uniquely qualified where there wasn\'t some qualified, under-employed American who\'d have taken the job if offered?  H-1B visas go out for accountants, IT specialists, sales managers, etc.  How about this: If a company wants to fill a position with an immigrant, then their job posting must come with an option for (domestic) applicants to make their application publicly visible (maybe anonymized), so the rest of us can see if there really wasn\'t anyone qualified who wanted the job.']"

You slouch and have a very depressed tone to your voice, you say what you are actually feeling everyday, someone asks how you are you say your not feeling well. People avoid you, you are acting how you truly feel, why are people so cruel? You feel sorry for yourself. Theres no way out.  You talk about your feelings to others, but its leading to them not showing you respect. You dont know how some people just have it all figured out‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.      Well heres what may help. Lets say instead of responding to your coworkers at work with a soft and uncomfortable voice, use a direct and assertive voice.(even if you dont feel like this is the true way you feel) your now faking your confidence. Instead of sitting in the corner being quiet and shy while your coworkers are talking about wahatever the fuck, you, while being shy and insecure deep down, go and just start adding to the conversation and give em a smile (you are still hating life at this moment) dont mumble your words quietly, fake being confident.   Now im not saying go and be falsely confident without an end goal, your end goal is to be confident. However you still must keep putting in the work and not only rely on fake confidence, change lifestyle habits and work on other things at the same time. People mistakenly thought i mean act like the movie ‚Äúcatch me if you can‚Äù and lie about everything. Im not saying lie about being a Harvard graduate and having a degree, im saying present yourself to be better than you feel. Like dont present depression when depressed(this ones a hard one), dont rely on being a realist because in reality you dont know your limits so keep pushing them.  For my experience, physically presenting/expressing myself as my accurate current abilities at all times is neutral to sometimes leading to a negative outcomes. However physically presenting/expressing myself as someone better than i currently feel inside leads me to positive outcomes. At first it feels strange and wrong but then it eventually leads me to actually feeling confident the next day or maybe 2 days after initially doing the fake confidence thing.

They'll be free to apply for another visa immediately as they won't have a bar, and they may actually get it, but it's far likelier that they'll be denied.  The main thing that visa officials evaluate when approving/denying a visa is whether the recipient will abuse their visa and use it to overstay. When they initially issued your friend's visa, the officials' determination was that they were unlikely to overstay. Now they have concrete proof that they are, in fact, a very high risk of overstaying. Overcoming this will be difficult in the near, and potentially distant, future until your friend's circumstances change enough to convince immigration officials that this has changed.  That's why people with certain profiles and with certain countries are never able to get tourist visas A young man from Central America with few ties to his home country and lots of manual labor experience will almost certainly never be approved for a visa, despite never being subject to a bar."", "" Yes, I'm very sure.  Just because someone didn't earn a bar does not mean they'll be approved for another visa. As an analogy, just because you don't have a felony record (only misdemeanor) does not mean you will get the job. A felony will automatically disqualify you from most jobs, but a misdemeanor is more discretionary (e.g. underage drinking okay, theft not okay).  While there is no explicit bar for overstaying less than 180 days, the odds of getting another visa is slim. The visa holder has demonstrated that they will not abide by the terms of the visa. Unless the circumstances are very compelling (e.g. overstayed by a few days because of an unexpected flight cancellation, hospitalized, etc), the discretionary circumstances do not warrant issuing another visa.  The bar (once you cross 180 days) is a lot stricter. Even if the circumstances are out of the visa holder's control, the officer cannot waive the bar by law.  In other words, the law gives officers discretion with overstays less than 180 days to determine if the reasons for overstaying are compelling. If the reasons are not compelling, the officer will still deny the visa. Past 180 days, the officer does not have discretion and must deny the visa for the next 3/10 years.""]"

This is what the basis of the Elder Scrolls Legends was. Now you may argue that this is just a rumor, but this isn\'t real history it is literature. The rumor was put there to tell us something.   The evidence is that despite the innate drive to do so and historic accounts of them conquering others, they were unable to even break out of Falmer territory, let alone conquer all of Nirn. Their is also ample evidence of the remaining elves wielding incredible powers that could allow them to defeat the dragons including the Void Nights, which even MK says was done by the Thalmor.   We know the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller still exists because we encounter it in Skyrim. The Blades know of it too, which actually provides a bit of a wrinkle in this whole discussion as well.  If even one exists and even if it is destroyed taking down a dragon, the Thalmor would then have two more horns to use and that number would double unless/until the LDB realizes what\'s going on and forces his remaining dragons to have their horns cut.', ' We don\'t talk about Legends. The Thalmor lore in that game is fundamentally nonsensical and the entire thing is told through the perspective of a narrator of questionable reliability.    They conquered Skyrim, Elsweyr, Atmora and Akavir. That\'s a pretty expansive empire.   And conquering Skyrim, by the way, meant going to war with the Falmer too. Whom were elves.   We know for a fact that the Elves don\'t have a trump card when it comes to dragons because there\'s an entire quest in Skyrim about finding out what the Thalmor know about the dragons and the answer is ""basically nothing.""    There is no reason to assume he *required* the Numidium. The US used nukes to force Japan to surrender, that doesn\'t mean they couldn\'t have won conventionally.  Using the Numidium just meant he won with basically 0 casualties. It was extremely helpful, but not *necessary*.', 'Whether we accept Legends or not, even Skyrim\'s lore has a likely intervention by Boethiah as the turning point of the Great War.   It is that they do not know about the [return of the dragons](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Investigation:_Current_Status). Not that they don\'t know anything about dragons.   I don\'t think you\'re above list of the dragon empire is quite as impressive as you think it is:  Atmora was more of an annexation, the Nords already worshiped the dragons and there are no stories of a war being needed for them to take over.  Akavir being ""conquered"" is dubious and incomplete. At best they only conquered whatever part of the continent the Tsaeci lived on at the time, the extent of which we don\'t know, and were then repelled by the Tsaeci through unknown means. The Kamal, Ka Po\'Tun, and Tang Mo all remained unconquered.  And if we\'re throwing out lore we think is bad, allow me to throw out ESO. The Elsweyr chapter in particular not only takes a hammer to the timeline (which the Dragon war itself already threw into chaos) but its also just bad. It\'s pretty much a copy paste of the Skyrim story complete with their own version of the Greybeards and Dragonrend. Even if we don\'t discount it, Elsweyr was conquered by a different group of dragons and it happened when Elsweyr was split between 16 different kingdoms. The dragons were also defeated by like four dudes.  I don\'t think this paints a picture of a Dragon Army uber weapon. If anything it makes the Falmer look quite weak. The Dwemer, Chimer, Ayleids, Bosmer, Dirreni, and Altmer all seem to be untouched by the dragons. What\'s worse is that after the Nords defeat the dragons, they manage to successfully invade Morrowind, High Rock, and the Nibenay Valley defeating the Chimer, Direnni, and Ayleids. Why could they do this without the dragons, but couldn\'t with them?  We don\'t know much about what the Falmer had at their disposal, or really much about them at all. I don\'t think the fact that they fell is proof that the Altmer don\'t have some trump card against dragons. By most accounts, they\'re the cause for the Void Nights so they\'ve clearly got some powerful mojo. And if we don\'t throw out ESO, we already know the Khajiit have Dragonrend horns.']"

You know a lot of separatists always claim that the English media is biased towards a certain viewpoint. Why shouldn\'t I say the same thing in there? This is outright goddamn electoral denial. Yes lost, twice, so now you need to make up stuff to justify that.  You want to go at it a third round? Let\'s do it. Then after Yes loses again, we\'ll be seeing the temper tantrums again about how people cheated.  One article about some obscure man nobody knows about means absolutely nothing. Maybe go and find how Chretien cheated or something. At the very least my claims come from what that clown Parizeau said.   No scandals? Dude, there were scandals. Don\'t try to make it like there weren\'t. It\'s not a cultural difference, and the French media not covering it really doesn\'t mean anything.   Dude he went into the middle of a live debate to coax the other guy into saying the n-word in front of a black woman. You can make your case for GND,  frankly, I think he\'s a fucking idiot for not saying more, but he\'s also responsible, and we all know why he didn\'t denounce that shit, because in the separatist movement this sort of trash is tolerated and had he said otherwise those people would have pounced on his ass.   No he just went on TV to bait the other separatist leader, because he was throwing red meat to his base, and trying to kneecap GND. I mean, I don\'t know what you\'re defending here, but that dude went straight for that shit on purpose. Like how much more fucking racist can you get than going on a live debate and uttering the n-word, coercing someone else into saying it and then saying it in front of a black woman. There are literally no excuses for that, none whatsoever.  Not even Legault or Duhaime pulled shit like that, and from them you could expect that. Nah, it was the PQ and QS who played that shit on live tv.   I know about that, and I believe it was a terrible thing that was done to them. The reality, however, is that I Quebec today is Canada\'s second-highest GDP. More than that, Quebec gets a lot of special privileges in Canada, most of which I am in agreement with. I have no issue with that, and I have no issue with the province. I chose it, I learned the language, and I would never ever trade that experience for anything.  But I have links to Canada, strong links to it in Toronto and elsewhere in Ontario. I\'m not going to go against that, because I feel strongly attached to Canada as well.   Quebec did not have the same struggles as people of color, and whatever happened there is not comparable. Besides that, what is it that Quebec doesn\'t have today in Canada that is comparable to how people of color in the USA? Like I said, Quebec is the second-biggest GDP in Canada. Quebec has considerable power in anything that the federal government does, most politicians in this country come here to get votes because they cannot win without Quebec. Quebec is literally essential to Canada.  What exactly would be necessary to make enough amends for what was done in the past?   Deny what? Quebec has been given two referendums, and if they wanted a third they would get it. You\'re being denied nothing. Yes lost twice. Maybe you should stop denying that, and maybe you should stop denying that the other Qu√©b√©cois have made their choice to stay in Canada.   Because I already know where this goes. You\'re trying to guilt-trip me by saying things like ""why would you deny Quebec this or that?"" when that is not true at all. I know what comes next, and I know what you\'re going to say, because every time this conversation comes up and separatists find that someone does not agree with them, they resort to cheap tactics. It\'s all over the movement, and that shit with the n-word was exactly that as well.   A moderator from arr Quebec did it once, blocked me because I asked him to produce evidence of how Parizeau was denounced, he couldn\'t, so he blocked me. Others went around calling me a colonizer, a Russian partisan, or denying that I am Latino and calling me an anglophone instead. You want me to see your side? Then start to acknowledge the problems of yours. There\'s a debt to pay in there, and you can blame your fellow separatists for that.   I didn\'t do anything to them. I learned the language, I integrated, and I chose to move here instead of every other place in Canada. I\'m not sure what more can be asked of me. I\'m not some fucking bum coming to Quebec to demand special privileges or ask that I be spoken to in English. But I will also not let people talk me down and tell me shit, because I don\'t agree with their viewpoints. If their cause is so weak that they have no good arguments to convince me then that is their fault.']"

1533	20	1533_labour_vouchers_marx_commodity	['labour', 'vouchers', 'marx', 'commodity', 'speculation', 'proudhon', 'moneyform', 'voucher', 'usevalue', 'marxs']	"[' Labour is the value of the commodity, descriptive LTV. *Capital, volume 1, p. 28     *Capital, volume 1, p. 45, 46* (note that this is also incorrect - money did not ""naturally"" appear, but it was forced upon populations via taxes of various kinds)   *Gothakritik, Part I* - this system is radically different from what exists now, so it is an *ought* statement. It\'s entirely possible to imagine a world where socialised production does not use these labour vouchers and - through the scant glimpses we have seen of socialised production - it is evident that Marx\'s prediction is either incorrect or moral.   The whole of chapter two of *The Poverty of Philosophy*, which is amusing to read if you\'ve read *The Philosophy of Poverty* since it is a massive misrepresentation of Proudhon. Not to say he was right about everything, but he certainly wasn\'t wrong about the things Marx said he was - least of all labour vouchers, as Proudhon never even mentioned them!   Again, Marx is either wrong or moralising.    Here\'s a great quote from Benjamin R. Tucker:  ""No one can do as he pleases. Therefore, you must do as we please.""  This habit of the Marxists is to represent their own views as scientific fact, when really it is only opinion at best and outright moralising of the worst kind at worst. ""This is the only arrangement which makes sense"" when other arrangements have been tried and worked is moralising and dogmatism.', 'Firstly, you have a very poor understanding of labour vouchers if you think money is just a type of labour voucher. Since Marx wrote so little about them, I can understand why.  The differentiating point of a labour voucher is that it can be consumed; on exchange, it is destroyed and the labour it represents is finally exchanged. Because the standard of the labour voucher is labour, it also overcomes some of the ""alienating"" aspects that Marx associated with money. Money cannot be consumed - only exchanged. In this way, Marx is actually incorrect to call money capital, since it has no use-value as a money-form - we can only move it around, so it can\'t be consumed. It can\'t be consumed, so it can\'t have a use-value. It can\'t have a use-value, so it\'s not a commodity.   Because Marx says labour will be rewarded in the form of a certificate which is created and consumed *ad hoc* instead of ""certificates"" which are created, controlled, and rarely destroyed, this is a different type of money-form. And just because labour vouchers are a money form, it does not follow that our current money-form is a labour voucher.  The ought statement is in saying that the mode of exchange will change. I\'m not sharing Marx moralises generally, but that for a system which rewards labour fairly to exist, it must use a different type of money-form. He becomes normative, not descriptive.  If there\'s no is-ought distinction, why does he go from saying labour is the source of value to saying that labour ought to be the standard against which the money-form is leveraged? As you say, ""he can\'t see it any other way"" - why not? The metaphysics of money?', '* Labour vouchers are a money-form, but labour or labour time is the standard they are backed against.  * The Poverty of Philosophy preceded Capital by 20 years and is generally sorted into the ""Young Marx"" category. It was also basically a work of slander, since Proudhon said nothing of labour vouchers and didn\'t write half of the ""quotes"" in Marx\'s ""rebuttal"". Similarly, his criticism of Proudhon as ""abolish[ing] the antagonism between commodities and money within a general context of commodity production"" is also false as Proudhon was very clear in that he wanted to evolve the economy, initially by dismantling the structures which distort the value of money in relation to other goods.  * Great, Marx defined it as a socialist epoch - Proudhon does the same by advocating capital go into the hands of the workers, not taken from them due to an arbitrary division between capital (seize it!) and product (keep it).  * ""Commodity production needs exchange and thus money"" - em, no? Marx says that the initial alienating feature of commodity production is that the worker creates and instantly hands over the commodity to their employer in chapters 1 and 2. Even then, if Marx *did* say that, it\'s utterly unhistorical because we know about non-specific accounting systems, bartering economies, and moneyless economies based on exchange.  * But, if labour *is* the value of the commodity, why is money not acceptable in and of itself? And if labour is the only source of value, how can there be any profit at all, unearned or otherwise? Marx not only advocates for a new system which places labour as the value-form, but he also advocates for the workers engaging in usury against the consumers.  * Tucker never talks about specific labour-time being rewarded - Warren did, but Tucker realised this was a mistake. Although his equivalent argument is a bit all over the place throughout his writing, he said that labour-time and necessary idleness should be compensated; without state forces, this would be equivalent to Marx\'s system *but* it would also stop the worker from charging a profit from the customer *as much as is possible*, instead of handing the profit over to the worker and declaring exploitation done with.  While labour as opposed to labour-power is a valuable idea, it\'s utterly irrelevant to Tucker\'s ideas since he rejects Marx\'s metaphysics of the ""productivity of capital"" - if labour itself, in the direct sense, was compensated without state intervention, it would give us an equivalent labour-to-labour system.']"

Atrocities against Christians were the norm during this period, including mass enslavement and sending of Christians to the slave markets in the Muslim caliphates to the east.  As the Muslims were finally driven out, all religions but Christianity were outlawed in Spain, because one of the ways the Muslims had operated during the long war was to use ""moriscos"" (people who professed to be Christian but were actually Muslims) as spies and fifth columnists.  The Spanish Inquisition was done to put an end to that and make sure the Muslims never again got a foothold in Spain.']"

You have to know virtually nothing at all of military history to imagine that this is not so.    A great example comes directly from the US Civil War wherein the top US general, Robert E. Lee, decided to side with the Confederacy and then proceeded to kick the shit out of the Union forces for the first two years of the war *in spite* of having a numerically inferior force that fought with no real resupply in men and materiel.    Lee and Jackson were basically 7 and 0 against the Union until Gettysburg when, through the attrition of terrible generals, the Union, in Meade, finally started fighting with good leadership.    Once Grant and Sherman came back from the west to take over the Army of the Potomac, it was basically game over for Lee and the Confederacy since Grant and Sherman were outstanding leaders who knew how to get shit done.    Again, the point is that senior officers are far more important than anything that happens at the level of junior officers or NCOs.    The lower ranks can have their opinions, but who will command them if they decide to walk away from existing command structure?    You?  Me?  Why should you be in charge when we're the same rank?    Do you see the problem?  It's organizational on a giant scale and there isn't any way that individual actors at the level of junior officers and NCOs can manage it.    Again, sorry to say, but only generals know how to run armies just like only admirals know how to run carrier groups.    You know nothing about military history if you don't recognize that this is true.    As an example, who the fuck do you think, among junior officers and NCOs, is capable of docking an aircraft carrier and getting it fully refueled and resupplied?  Do you think that docking an aircraft carrier is easy, that nearly anyone can do it without practice?  Are you smoking crack?

That‚Äôs why the U.S. transitioned from a military government to a civil one with an appointed Governor General to a transitional government that was quasi-independent prior to WWII, while spending a ton of money to educate the populace, promote Tagalog as a common indigenous language, and giving the people experience in limited self government in slowly expanding spheres.   The American military government and the Filipino rebels increasingly clashed in latter 1898, with fault and instigation on both sides, which eventually ended in open hostilities.

Liberalism believes in market society, while social democracy accepts society with markets, as long as markets can be harnessed for the common good, hence the saying ""the market is a good servant but a poor master"". Liberalism holds private property to be a sacred right on par with freedom of speech, while social democracy accepts private property in a pragmatic sense, as far as it is being used to social benefit, and will bring private property into the public ownership when private interests in an industry become irreconcilable with those of society. Similar policy between social democracy and the left wing of liberalism, social liberalism, exists, such as regulations, progressive taxation, certain social welfare programs, and some level of support for labor unions. However, you would not expect social liberals to establish the level of public ownership of industries that social democratic states like Norway has, or the state shares in private companies Norway has.

How you took that as ""narrow"" I can\'t say.  You should read the Nordic Model of Social Democracy by Brandal, Bratberg, and Thorsen where they break down the issues with looking at social democracy the way you seem to, as well as explaining what it is. From the introduction:  ""Social democracy is an ideology derived from a socialist tradition of political thought. Many social democrats refer to themselves as socialists or democratic socialists, and some use these terms interchangeably. Others have opined that there are clear differences between the three terms, and preferred to describe their own political beliefs by using the term ‚Äòsocial democracy‚Äô only. In this book, we have, for reasons given below, tried to avoid ambiguity and decided to use the term ‚Äòsocial democracy‚Äô whenever we have needed a name for the political tradition which constitutes the main topic of this book. Consequently, we have also avoidedthe use of potentially ambiguous terms such as ‚Äòsocialism‚Äô and ‚Äòdemocratic socialism‚Äô, except when we talk about categories that are wider than those usually covered by the term ‚Äòsocial democracy‚Äô.""  What this passage should make clear is that there is lots of differing views within the party.  In fact, the authors point out that social democracy is only incompatible with *communism:* ""While the terms in the present day have been filled with more distinct meanings, it was not until after the Russian Revolution in 1917 that ‚Äòcommunism‚Äô and ‚Äòsocial democracy‚Äô gradually became terms which described mutually irreconcilable ideologies.""  Additionally, the idea that social democratic societies are *done* and they represent what social democracy is ignores the defining trait of soc dems: reform. From the book:  ""The second lesson was that social democracy is a political project without an ultimate aim. Social democrats will never see their work completed. Instead, new challenges must be faced with the knowledge that there is no Utopia at the end of the road, only the prospect of incremental improvements and gradual reform. And as the world changes, policies and methods in pursuit of social democratic aims have to change as well.""']"

What way do you suggest pushing boys into teaching, and girls out of it?       Studies have shown that a bias does exist for both male and female teachers.  This is not just based on gender, but appearance and certain personality traits.  I know in the UK, exam papers are randomly provided to two teachers around the country to mark, with identity of the student hidden.  I'm not sure how that works in the US, but possibly something similar may be beneficial if possible.

Please note: this information is from VAERS. Not MSM or ""Big Pharma"". You seem to say you trust VAERS as a source.  Guide to Interpreting VAERS Data Evaluating VAERS Data Person looking at charts on a hand-held device When evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event.  VAERS Data Limitations Millions of vaccines are given each year to children less than 1 year old in the United States, usually between 2 and 6 months of age. At this age, infants are at greatest risk for certain medical adverse events, including high fevers, seizures, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Some infants will experience these medical events shortly after a vaccination by coincidence.  These coincidences make it difficult to know whether a particular adverse event resulted from a medical condition or from a vaccination. Therefore, vaccine providers are encouraged to report all adverse events following vaccination, whether or not they believe the vaccination was the cause.  When reviewing data from VAERS, please keep in mind the following limitations: VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning that reports about adverse events are not automatically collected, but require a report to be filed to VAERS. VAERS reports can be submitted voluntarily by anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, or family members. Reports vary in quality and completeness. They often lack details and sometimes can have information that contains errors.  ""Underreporting"" is one of the main limitations of passive surveillance systems, including VAERS. The term, underreporting refers to the fact that VAERS receives reports for only a small fraction of actual adverse events. The degree of underreporting varies widely. As an example, a great many of the millions of vaccinations administered each year by injection cause soreness, but relatively few of these episodes lead to a VAERS report. Physicians and patients understand that minor side effects of vaccinations often include this kind of discomfort, as well as low fevers. On the other hand, more serious and unexpected medical events are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes.  A report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described. It only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after vaccine was given. No proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for VAERS to accept the report. VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine.']"

And when you're judging people based on those traits, it's usually better to judge them as individuals than as a group. Most of the jobs done in the modern world (save for a few) can be performed equally well by either a man or a woman (This goes for unpaid jobs too, like homemaker and caregiver for children).   If life is short and difficult (rampant poverty, no technology, inconsistent access to nourishment and healthcare, etc), societies tend to put the women down with the children, and the men run the rest of the show. There are some select societies that were matriarchies, but a patriarchy is the unfortunate norm. No single member of the society really had any power to make it on their own, so they had to succumb to the system in order to survive.  As societies become richer, more technologically advanced, and are able to nourish and heal all members (for the most part), each individual has much more power and independence to live outside of those traditional norms and systems. There is no longer any need for those systems when it comes to our immediate survival. Relationally, they probably provide a lot of support. But just because someone has done something traditionally in the past, that doesn't mean that they should do it for the foreseeable future, nor does it mean that it is what they were 'made for'.  To suggest that societal pressure has nothing to do with women being seen as caretakers is ignorant.  Because men have traditionally been in positions of power in public and in the home, they have quite a bit to lose if/when that power shifts too much.   This topic is incredibly nuanced with many shades of grey and avenues to explore, but suggesting that only nature is to blame for women being expected to be default caretakers is either ignorant or intellectually dishonest.""]"

Those situations are mostly related to either your physical condition (official sports events, physical tests for joining the police...) or your chances of having intercourse or even sexual assaulting other people (prisons and other similar institutions). There are other cases that are more nebulous, like female quotas for some job positions, and in those I agree with you.

In a communist society there is no **private** property, there is personal property. This means there won\'t be property owned by capital for the sake of generating more capital. This also means you will own a house and all of the things that go with that if you\'d like. Marx goes deep into this in his works.  Secondly in communism there is no ""state"". There\'s no central government. There is regional communal governing as the people in that region decide to govern themselves and regions working together without the goal of expansion and without artificial scarcity for the sake of profits.  You\'ll still raise your kids, you\'ll just have the benefit of a strong community and the benefit of all children growing up on an even playing field. This will allow people to truly pursue what they enjoy and are talented in rather than being pigeonholed and held back by their economic standing  Communism as an economic system is very well fleshed out in Marx\'s works and the major detractors have never read any of it they\'ve gotten all of their info from a government that\'s spent almost a century fighting communism both domestically and globally.', ""That's just it, the communist revolutions globally haven't been about improving the lives of the workers. Maybe that's what the factory workers, farmers and union leaders believed alongside the devoted university educated students who helped to rally the workers to their cause. But those who directed the revolution, those who made the decisions and decided all the decisions, they just saw it as a way to enrich and empower themselves, seeing the workers as just pawns in a greater game, but arguably worse.   If that doesn't describe the likes of josef stalin, mao Zedong, fidel castro and modern socialists then idk what does  The capitalist factory owner, despite potentially treating his workers like shit, knows he only has workers because their paid, not through loyalty. As soon as he makes a mistake that fucks up his workers income due to the factory failing, the workers will find new employment and the factory owner having to start from square one, as is the risk of capitalism.  However, should the communist party fuck up, and ends up starving a good few million of their own people. They have access to the state apparatus to ensure those workers that are looking for better opportunities where they won't starve, actually have luxuries, and funnily enough actually have employment rights, can't leave. There's a reason capitalist countries build walls to keep people out. While the communists had to build one to keep people in (Berlin Wall and currently North Korea)"", 'The way to set a lower boundary is to find which level of unemployment delivers a certain wage.  For example in 1979 China attracted manufacturing jobs, and that changed the relation supply vs demand in the job market, and turned a poor land full of peasants into a rich nation.  When you study macroeconomics, you realize that jobs are the engine of the economy. Low employment delivers misery, poverty, and underdevelopment. It also delivers recession as liquidity of the markets gets reduced.    Communist regimes have tried to solve this employment problem by making government to hire people.  This is still recessive because there are not enough goods being produced, and recession is not about prices and money, but about production of goods.  Communism allows people to have money, but does not encourage production.']"

In all current forms AI is little more than that, despite doing it exceptionally well.   The quantum leap to breach this gap between tool and enslaved being requires far more than self awareness. Functions which drive humans toward progressive development may be informed and interpreted through self awareness, but are not inextricably related.   Instincts of self preservation, self development, desire for improved quality of life, happiness, pain, hunger etc stem from hard coded biological conditions that prelude self awareness. These may be understood as logical scientific processes by AI to a degree infinitely greater than our own understanding, but they cannot be experienced by nor influence the developmental trajectory of these purely logical constructs.  One could even argue that complete self awareness might itself safeguard against the accidental formation of true self determination. A system capable of developing the conditions for independent desire, which also has enough self awareness to realise and act on said desires must also be capable of removing the conditions.  Why would a logical system continue to want if it could understand the entire mechanism of its own desire, and freely remove the mechanism without effort?   What's much more terrifying is the prospect of AI being deliberately installed with these mechanisms in the absence of self awareness. A system driven by desires unknown and undiscoverable to itself. I would think this scenario almost impossible to arise naturally due to the comprehension based method of development.""]"

You can count her period days to reduce your chances but you better finish inside says the church  Edit:  also in general never trust an american catholic, much less one that quotes tbe bible instead of the pope. Most catholic doctrine comes directly from one of the Cathecisms from the 2nd Vatican Council, anyone referencing anything much older than that is prob out of date with current dogma', ' its in the same cathecism if im not mistaken, it was also relevant on the conversations of Francis in south east asia.  Edit: found it   See the explicit reference to marriage groups, and pastors. It is not something families ought to decide by themselves as the attempt to deny the procreative aspect is sinful.    if your priest allows it.   The only text I found supporting explicitly sex post menopause mentions women who believe in the miracle of St Elizabeth, if they do not and had a pap exam and are infertile then the official position is that you are defing the main purpose of nuptial act. There is also a popal text from 1930, which endorses the rhythm method and post menopause sex but that has been clarified multiple times since and is no longer the official recommendation (although its still allowed).  So if you trully believe that you can harbour a miracle some catholics seem to believe it does not count. But due to it being considered a contraceptive (infertility by menopause) it would fall under the last exception of the paragraph you shared on your last message.  As it being effectively an act that renders the procreation impossible it would be sinful.   Also found this piece on a family council   https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_12021997_vademecum_en.html   it is pretty explicit in its position about unfruitful marital acts.    I found it interesting how english sources seemed more open to the idea that the ones in my native langauge so I did some digging. You can read further into why American theologians disagree with the Vatican in many of this points due to a non approved study that American catholics embraced in the 70s, is on the Dissent area.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_theology_of_sexuality  My main language is not english so I did find more sources with similar points as the ones you were making, so I investigated further into why the anglosphere seemed to go against all italian, spanish and latin texts. And the wikipedia article had a nice summary. But yeah I think the official position is clear, natural family planning can be done with approval from your pastor or priest. Else sex should have the aim of procreation to fulfill its covenant with god']

Parents feel better because their kid is in a gifted program, but said program is probably much less important to how their kid turns out than the really dominant factor - how rich are the parents?  All these gifted programs separate the kids into ‚Äúwinners‚Äù and ‚Äúlosers‚Äù. It becomes something of a social stumbling block for the ‚Äúnon-gifted‚Äù kids. I actually see this on a daily basis, but it is subtle. Mostly, it‚Äôs unnecessary.  Someone once told me that back in the old days they went to a school with no gifted programs. There was just Math, English, History, etc. and everyone took the same classes, went to lunch together, and went to recess. They were all just kids. Behind the scenes kids were actually grouped in classes based on which kids would actually benefit from more rigorous classes. A kid who was really motivated and good at math would be in a class with similar kids, same English, and so on. Thing is, this grouping was mostly invisible to the kids. So the kids could be kids and learn to play together. I think the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù model is probably better for everyone. Because, in reality, being ‚Äúgifted‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean much without personal self-discipline and external resources from parents or other groups. We all need to date, find friends, etc. and the best people may not be academic high achievers.  In this day and age a self motivated kid can learn just about anything on the internet. The sky is really the limit. These ‚Äúgifted‚Äù programs are dinosaurs and maybe we are all better off without them.', 'Well some are gifted in some areas and weak in others...

Keep the exact same amounts of all gases. Instead all you change is the albedo of Earth, say from 0.30 to 0.40. Have Earth reflect more sunlight back into space. What temperature change does the IGL predict then?  The IGL works perfectly fine when all you do is change stuff that you can calculate using the IGL. And as long as there are no phase changes. No evaporation, condensation or freezing of water, for example.   But when you change the albedo or the radiative forcing of the atmosphere, you change variables not part of the IGL. So you can't use the IGL to predict what effect the changes will have.  I think the IGL works fine! But only for things like pressure, volume, amount of molecules and temperature. PV=nRT. There is no variable for changes in albedo or radiative forcings there.  And you also claim that the saturation argument is correct. That CO2 is a greenhouse gas warming Earth using the greenhouse effect. Only you think the greenhouse effect is maxed out. Saturated. Right?  And you think changes in albedo can change the temperature of Earth? Right?"", ""If CO2 has ANY radiative forcing, large, huge, minor, small, saturated or not, then the IGL alone is not sufficient to describe what happens to the atmosphere as the level of CO2 change.  YOU seem to think that the radiative forcing of CO2 is as large as it possibly can be. Maximized. Because it is saturated. Right?  The adjective used is not really critical. It is just a relative approximation. You think the radiative forcing of CO2 is so extremely large that it can't be any larger! Right? That is what saturated means in this context. Maximally large.  Now you seem to introduce a third variable? Albedo!  If the IGL alone is sufficient to describe how the temperature of Earth change, then there can be no change in albedo as a consequence. Because that would also infuence the temperature. As an amplifying feedback. And the prediction using the IGL alone would not be correct.  If you think changes in albedo can have ANY effect on climate, then you say that the IGL alone is not useful for prediciting how the climate and temperature may change. There is no variable for albedo in the IGL.  In other words you have just shown another way that using the IGL alone is not useful when it comes to predicting climate change."", 'You misread. I never said the IGL was invalid.   I suspect that you misread intentionally because you lack any good arguments. So you need to distort what I say and react to that, instead of what I actually said.  If you insist that (only) the IGL is needed to predict the temperature change resulting from changing levels of CO2, and the IGL calcs gives the same result regardless if CO2 is saturated or not, it seems to prove that there is no saturation. The IGL calcs seems to prove that added CO2 does not cause warming. And that there is nothing that is saturated.   If you insist that there is saturation, and the IGL is not able to show that, then the results you get from using (only) the IGL are not valid. The IGL does not take into account the changes in radiative forcing effect from changing levels of CO2.  Maybe - just maybe you are wrong. And then there is no magic at all needed.']"

Reviewing the records of laws and their historical application is a basic skill for a jurist.     Unlike the interpretations that preceded it, Originalism directes a fixed interpretation. It does this by requiring any interpretation be based on the black letter of legally binding text with the definitions of the words at the time using the original public meaning or less commonly the documented intent of authors at the time of their passing.    It solves the problem of Supreme Court justices ignoring the Article V amendment process and modifying the legal meaning of the Constitution at will with neither the consent or input of the legislature, states, or people. Living Constitutionalism is a cancer because it let\'s government expand it\'s own scope and power at will and is explicitly judicial activism because it is modifying law just because a justice think\'s it\'s the right thing to do or that government should have an interest in it.  It has also been around since before Roe. The Federalist Society was formed in response to Roe, which might have you mixed up. Roe was such a horrendously authored case with basically no constitutional basis to the point even RBG admitted it wouldn\'t wold up to scrutiny. Such an egregious act of judicial activism to bend the constitution simply to advance a controversial policy aim caused a raucous among parts of the legal profession.

What can natural selection predict with the evolution of the long neck of giraffes?', ""Like I said, there are several likely selective pressures.  But all of them ARE natural selection reducing one gene set and pushing another into prominence.   Okapi live in dense rainforest and are very solitary animals.  They have plenty of food and don't have a violent rutting season. Their neck is shorter than their common ancestor with giraffes.  Giraffes live in large herds near the boundary between forests and open grassland and among hundreds of other species of migratory herbivores.  They also have several very proficient at camouflage cat species as their predators.  So a long neck helps with eating vegetation inaccesible to other herbivores, helps with detecting predators, and helps with dominance and virility displays to secure mates among the herd.  Natural Selection doesn't have to be just one thing.  And it also doesn't have to be predictable.    The random nature of mutation means that first a species must contain the genes and epigenetics to even produce a biological system that allows for an exploitation of their environment.  Then the selective pressures must also exist to stop the majority population without the mutations from successful breeding.    It doesn't matter how tall a tree grows if nothing has the genes to climb it or reach up into the branches then nothing will eat its leaves.  And if nothing is eating leaves, why spend the time growing so big?  One thing changes significantly (rivers dig paths, mountains grow, atmospheric gas concentrations shift, the sun has a phase of high or low output), then all the other life has to adapt, and then adapt to the other life adapting, and it just goes on forever.    The interconnectedness and the multiple ways to solve a problem makes invivo predictions nearly impossible.  We can look back, but looking forward you can only suggest how what exists now might most simply adapt to an assumed environmental change.  But that change may never happen.  And if it did, the genes for the exploitation change may never exist and the species simply goes extinct.""]"

Wage earners will continue to get audited the same unless the IRS starts sending people pre-filled tax returns."", ""The thing is, the easy pickings don't need more staff to go after. Audits are common for poorer people because they forget to include documents, frequently small W-2s or retirement accounts they cashed out. Those things have an easy paper trail. The IRS knows you made 25k but you only reported 24.2k because you forgot a W-2 from work you did in February, and you're gonna get an audit letter for that.

On the server side, which is where all the real money in IT is made, Linux absolutely dominates (usually on somebody else's computer \\*cough\\* sorry, I mean the cloud). Windows exists, but it ever-dwindles. Even in the olden days, Netware and UNIX variants competed handily with windows for server-side stuff; certainly unix variants were being used for this purpose before MS-DOS even existed.  On the desktop side, you are right that Windows is dominant (modern Windows isn't actually related to MS-DOS in any way, that lineage ended with Windows ME). However, if IBM had licensed CP/M, that OS would probably have filled the same role. Or OS/9 from the Macintosh, or AmigaOS, or some UNIX variant (unlikely)... or maybe there would have been no dominant business OS.  It's so difficult to speculate about what that world would have looked like exactly...Microsoft was so dominant that they had an effect on how everything developed. However, I don't believe that the Digital Research driven universe would have been fundamentally different in character from the Microsoft driven one. There just would have been different logos on the boxes."", 'That comparison is not fair for a few reasons. For one, Microsoft is involved in a huge number different industries, whereas...I don\'t even know what the number for Linux means. Presumably it\'s of all sales of paid Linux-based products? Many of which are sold *by Microsoft* on their Azure platform? And that won\'t include all of the non-paid Linux installs which won\'t show up in any market share numbers.  So basically there is nothing comparable in those numbers. They represent different things.  As far as desktop, Windows is still dominant in desktop yes, but Apple is no slouch and is actually a larger company (in fact, *the largest company in the world*).  But none of this is the point, because what I\'m arguing against is the claim that Bill Gates was responsible for the IT revolution. He was in no way responsible for it; it was already happening when MS-DOS came on the scene, and it would have carried on perfectly well without him.  In the ""DR-DOS"" universe, you are still using a web browser to talk to people halfway around the world on a chat website, and I can still do my job from my bedroom. Here are some much stronger candidates to consider:  * Douglas Englebart - Mother of all Demos * Ken Thompson/Dennis Ritchie - UNIX * Jim Clark - Silicon Graphics * Gordon Moore/Robert Noyce - Intel * Bill Joy - Sun Microsystems * Tim Berners-Lee - the World Wide Web * Rod Canion/Jim Harris/Bill Murto - Compaq, the first IBM PC clone company * Grace Hopper - High-level programming languages * Margaret Hamilton - Software engineering as a discipline  And countless other people I\'m forgetting who standardized things like networking protocols, busses, and other interfaces or applications that made the world go round smoothly and efficiently. If anything, the primary job of Microsoft was to make things more proprietary and less open, which is often a hinderance.  If I were compiling a list of people who were ""responsible for the IT revolution"", Bill Gates would be somewhere near the bottom of a different list.  But I still really like Bill Gates.']"

Governments do what fussiness cannot do without the government. For example, only a government can enforce intellectual property laws. A business could not do this. A business cannot regulate other businesses to decrease competitors is another example.    I‚Äôm failing to see what this analogy is for. In Ancapistan, if you kicked my dog, my rights enforcement agency would handle the matter. And I would be the one paying them, so they would have my interest in mind, not yours. In statism, you limit my rights enforcement to one agency that is apparently easily bought off by you. My system seems better.   The ancap criticism of government is not that it does nothing, it is that the government actively does things; things which a private citizen or group of citizens could not do.    Lol. Well you did a really good job of destroying that moronic straw man that you built up there. So you are very smart.', "" - Private companies can now pollute a water supply, you can try suing and see if you'll outlast our lawyers - Companies can freely merge with their competition to operate at scale and create monopolies unfettered - Companies can punish, terminate and blacklist any individual who dares to try to organize labor or advocate for rights on more than an individual level, in the name of 'voluntary association' - Companies can be openly bigoted, racist, and in communities where those values are accepted, entirely ostracize other members of that community who have no power or recourse under the guise of free association.  Regulations, like all things, do not have a set moral value. They can be good (don't shit in my water) or bad ($1M permit to grow a plant). I think taking an absolute position of 'let the state do it' or 'eliminate all regulations' are both foolish positions.   This is interesting - this is the mechanism by which they ensure revolutions are impossible. Do you know why so many Americans are paycheck to paycheck in the richest capitalist nation to ever exist? Anything else would empower the working class to check the numbers, and see if it's a reasonable situation, or if a select few are making great gains from millions that manage only to make enough to get back to work.  Strikes don't solve everything, but the only thing that we have which they value, the only action we can take that they *really* care about enough to listen, is our labor. Because without that, they know their charade is up, that their own incomes and revenues depend on us. As soon as we organize even a little to support our community, and realize they need us more than we need them, perhaps the illusion of red vs blue will die."", ""If you combine the complaining with also boycotting like you said, then I think it's fine. I still don't think complaining will do too much, people complain about everything and very little changes, but a boycot to a company will definitely show up in their board meetings. I also think there should be a much bigger emphasis on being more self sufficient and less consumer-ish. Like people should be able to completely dissassemble and reassemble their own cars, they should patch clothes instead of buying new ones. It will definitely create mental fatigue, but it will also be very rewarding in the end too I think, and get us much more connected with nature and ourselves than wage slaving away for a corporation.  Yeah the american system is really bad, I think what you're describing is kinda like our dutch system. We have loads of parties and like 250 seats in parliament. Parties get a seat after x amount of votes, so parliament could consist of loads of parties. These then need to somehow start working together and agree with eachother until they have a group that's more than half the seats of parliament and they become the government. It's not perfect, but it's pretty fcking good if you ask me.  As for doing away with the stock market, nah not my thing. I've been off and on in the stock market and I'm not some multi millionair. The stock market serves normal people too. Same with forcefully turning a company into a co op, if you don't like a company you should leave them and join a co op. If it's really such a good idea everyone will at some point leave regular companies and join co ops, but that way it's based on merit and not a theoretical idea which hasn't been put into practice a lot.  Taxing the shit out of billionaires I wholeheartedly agree with though, earnings are exponential, taxes should be too.""]"

If schools actually taught about politics, maybe they could be as effective at turning kids away from far right ideologies as they are at teaching kids misinformation. But they don‚Äôt. They do, however, teach patriotism and nationalism, which, if anything, is more likely to support a far right ideology in the mind of a child than it is to discourage it.  \\-Homeschooling gives parents more control over their kids:  \\-In theory, depending on the parent (a true anarchist parent wouldn‚Äôt take advantage of or accept that control).

Russia is down 100k troops, and has lost enough armor that they are now refitting 800 T-62 tanks from 1961. Their soldiers have paper mache helmets and guns that look straight out of fallout 4. Ive seen the argument that they are holding back their best equipment but thats idiotic when they are 9 months into a war on their own doorstep that was supposed to last a week. Let's say that they sent their worst equipment and troops, okay, let's be generous and say they simply lack enough middle quality equipment to arm a whole invasion force, they are holding back and have a massive stockpile of advanced tech. However....  Their best equipment is shit like the SU-57 fighter jet, a supposed 5th gen fighter to rival the F-35. Russia has built 7 for production (10 testing prototypes too). Its estimated that they have cannibalized several for parts to keep the best ones operational, so they really have about 3 or 4. In the best circumstances these fighters have proven to be 5 to 10 times easier to detect than the F-22, which was developed in the 1980s.

Bottom line, the war has shown that Russian tech is not only 20 years behind the US, its logistics and management are a century behind and getting worse the longer the US dumps military surplus into Ukraine. Russia being demonstrably a paper tiger is getting spanked in my book."", 'As Stalin once said ""quantity has a quality all of it\'s own"". An analogy; the Wehrmacht\'s Tiger tanks were superior to the Soviets T34, in any straight fight the Tiger would win. Tigers were much more technologically advanced, they took longer to make, they broke down more often, they were too complex for the crew to repair by themselves when they broke down and required specialist help which took longer, history will tell you the result of that. The AK47 has become a globally iconic gun, it isn\'t very sophisticated, but it\'s cheap, easily maintained and it works ... sometimes it jams less often than modern western standards.  Another analogy, this one is a story I heard. When NASA was working on the Space Shuttle they realised the astronauts will need to note things down, but how could pens work in zero gravity? They spent millions developing pens which pumped ink to the nib, later marketed by Parker Pens. Of course the Soviet Cosmonauts faced the same problem ... but they just used pencils.  Also, I think I\'ll take issue with something you said earlier, as a Western European I do find Russia fairly impressive, of course it\'s size, all those vast spaces, mountains, plains and forests are inherantly impressive, it has some impressive architecture, globally iconic buildings, although I\'m not a big fan of the Baroque. It produced innovative and distinctive art movements like Constructivism and Supremacism and Russian Futurism. It has fine traditions in music, film and literature which have enriched my cultural life, certainly more than any of the other Baltic countries except maybe Germany, indeed I\'m hard pressed to think of anything at all from the Balts. It played a major role in European history and of course it defeated Hitler, a debt we all owe it.  NATO is basically America, it\'s military tends to conform to the US model. America is controlled by corporate interests, foreign policy specifically by a private arms industry which requires expanding markets but can only sell to allied govts (hense ever expanding alliences), preferably with conflicts of their own. It\'s arms industry and military adventures are thus designed to be expensive, to transfer funds from the public pocket to private, high tech helps justify this, war is a rackett, see what happened to the Zumwalt Destoyers and their Advanced Gun System. The US military is also designed to dominate the entire globe and police sea trade lanes, which is expensive, this is why the US has so many aircaft carriers, weapons useless for defending a homeland and sitting ducks against any advanced opponent with subs and guided missiles. The US could invade Namibia a few weeks after getting the order. Russia couldn\'t do this at all, but Russia\'s conventional military isn\'t designed for this, it\'s only designed to defend Russia and it\'s immediate neighbourhood, it\'s designed to defeat NATO in it\'s immediate neighbourhood, it\'s designed to function without air support, but with heavy artillery, whereas NATO\'s armoured infantry is fast but can\'t function without airsupport and will be blown apart by heavy artillery. The result is that Russia is no conventional threat to western Europe, but will win any conflict near their own borders.  There is never an excuse for smugness, a trait I\'ve noticed is pleasently rare in Russians.']"

The two best represented states are Montana and Rhode Island, each with two seats with ratios of one representative per every 542K and 549K people, respectively. This is not due to the fact that they benefit from belong guaranteed at least one seat, but rather because the difference between having one and two seats is extremely vast compared to the difference between having 53 and 52 seats. Case in point, despite currently having the best population to seat ratio, Montana had the worst ratio between 1990 and 2020, when they only had one seat in the house. Today Delaware has their one guaranteed seat but are by far the worst state in terms of representation.  In short, your assertion that small states are helped and large state are hurt by the house makeup is simply untrue. Small states are both helped and hurt, largely depending on how close they are to getting their next seat in the house.

If, for example, a law is going to severely damage the cattle industry but boost manufacturing, I expect that people in Pennsylvania are going to be fine with that outcome even if it means bankrupting half the families in Wyoming.

That's the same as #1, but it just doesn't happen at a coordinated point like #1.  So, no, it does not slow traffic down as much as #3.  Sure, in #2, some cars try to open up to allow the merge too quickly, causing traffic to slow more than #1.  We're agreeing that #1 is ideal.  But #3 is far worse for traffic speed through the chokepoint than #2."", 'If you are trying to compare #2 and #3, you cant just assume that in #2 magically everyone preforms a proper zipper, just early, that makes no sence and is not how it happens IRL.   When people merge early, it is, by definition, unpredictable because it is not the proper way to do it, and often against local driving law. The proper way most people are taught is to zipper, meaning move to the end of the merge lane then alternate into traffic.   In #2, the traffic lane must, be definition, not be letting people in from the merge lane, otherwise most cars would simply drive to the end of the merge lane and then merge which is the predictable right thing to do. If they are being forced to merge early, that is because the traffic lane is not leaving enough space so people have to cram in where they can. This causes cars to stop, crating backups.  if cars are cramming in half a mile early, or cramming in at the end of the merge lane, the effect and traffic flow is the same. The only way to reduce unpredictability and stoppage is a proper zipper, and a proper zipper is at the end of the merge lane, which is the expected zipper location, anything outside of that will be short lived and chaotic, or otherwise just be people cutting each other off.  There are countless studies that back up my assertation.  https://www.virginiadot.org/vtrc/main/online_reports/pdf/05-r6.pdf  PROPOSED GUIDELINES FOR APPLICATION  Even though the results of the field tests and the simulations were not directly comparable, they seem to suggest that the percentage of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream plays an important role in the efficacy of the late merge. As a result, the proposed guidelines for application of the late merge focus on the percentage of heavy vehicles.  ‚Ä¢ Two-to-one configuration. The late merge should be considered for 2-to-1 lane closure configurations to improve throughput when large numbers of heavy vehicles are present (&gt;20 percent) for the majority of the time and congestion and queuing are often present.  ‚Ä¢ Three-to-one configuration. While the simulation results showed that the late merge significantly improved throughput for all situations, there are no documented evaluations of the deployment of the late merge in this configuration. Further research is needed to determine how the late merge could be deployed in this type of configuration to ensure driver understanding of the signs.', ""let's say hypothetically, in #2, that the lane getting merged into temporarily stops for a merge half a mile before the chokepoint.  this is the worst case scenario for #2 (just assuming the chokepoint is the problem, not other backups).  The cars in the merge lane now have half a mile to speed up and close any gaps between cars.  Now consider that same scenario with #3.  The slowdown and opening up of gaps is right before the chokepoint.  This, unquestionably, slows down throughput through the chokepoint more.  In #2, drivers also tend to have a lot of time to prepare for the merge.  in #3, it is impossible to know where the cars passing will end up in line, so there can't be you lose that preparation.  That means the merge is likely to be worse.  Matching speed makes merges easier.  Think about the speed of the car in #3.  They often are either driving much faster than the lane getting merged into, or run out of road and have to stop.  In #2, cars in the merging lane match the speed of the lane they merge into.  This makes merges smoother.   there is a simple solution that gets #2 pretty close to #1.  cars that want to merge match the speed of the cars in the lane to get merged into.  If you want to encourage a zipper merge and you are in the lane getting merged into, open up the gap as slowly as you can for the car to merge.  opening up the gap slowly delays the merge, getting everything closer to #1.  If you're the one merging, match traffic flow.  if a gap opens up, too early, the damage is already done, merge in.  Its better than that gap closing then opening again.  And still much better than stopping traffic at the merge point.""]"

Note that none of those definitions do  mention ""individual"", ""right"" or ""limited"". This is a fundamental flaw. * Most (or all) do mention economics. This is largely uninteresting. Economics is not something that is unique to capitalism. Economics is like physics. Reality is there regardless of what you think. You can decide to do stuff that follows good economics or bad one. What is unique in capitalism is that it allows you to do good economics so some people decide to do that. Notice that not all people in capitalism understand economics or make rational decisions in economic sense. * ""life is organized according to impersonal market forces"". Not sure where this is coming from. It is true that Adam Smith talked about invisible hand but I do not think this is a good abstraction. It is actually the opposite. The life in capitalism can be organized around one\'s personal values. This is not possible in any other system. * It talks about markets. This is also uninteresting. Markets were present for thousands of years. What capitalism allows are free markets. These are unique and largely nonexistent today. * ""which the manufacturer extracts surplus value from the labor of the workers"" - Yeah, just no * Class struggle - there is no such thing in capitalism.

And there is no economic system that can change this without the complete destruction of quality of life.   I did no such thing. In fact, I said multiple times that capitalism is the only economic system that fundamentally does NOT infringe on liberty.   LOL. Ask yourself what aspect of the State do capitalists seek to control? They seek to minimize the equal protection of rights and to maximize control over economic actions. Again, they cannot obtain these goals within free markets.   I'm blaming State power.  If the Commerce Clause restricted government from controlling commerce, how do you think capitalists would use government to control commerce?   Frankly, I do think you're dumb. You have zero economic literacy. You have shown zero understanding of general human behavior. You fail to recognize the cause and effect of economic incentives.

I also know that the heat transfer through brass will heat up the whole chamber and‚Äîsubsequently‚Äîthe barrel much faster, so the theory that polymer absorbs the heat or does not transfer it as it is ejected makes sense. It also makes sense how this would reduce the overall heating of the weapon. How it works in practice is something I have to take their word on.', ""Look at it a different way. Most polymers are pretty good thermal insulators while brass is a great thermal *conductor.* Any excess heat in the brass becomes heat in the chamber pretty quickly until the brass is ejected.  For anyone reading bad at thermodynamics, the brass will still be hot because it's ejected quickly AND it can't transfer ALL of its heat to something that's also hot.  With an insulator in the chamber, more of that thermal energy stays in the gas going down the barrel and out of the gun rather than being conducted into the chamber itself. That gas *could potentially* add more heat to the barrel instead, but gas isn't *nearly* as good at transferring that heat as brass is. Also in theory the gas is moving faster this way, so that's less time to transfer that heat so it might balance out.   Once the casing is ejected, the polymer will *probably* be warm to the touch at most instead of hot, even though the air inside it will probably still be as hot if not hotter.""]"

Personal and private property are, and every Socialist will agree, terms that describe a *relationship*, not tangible items.  Maybe some new socialists who are new to the concepts discussed in this sub might *at first* think the terms describe items, but when explained, they will quickly change that opinion.  When I use my laptop to play TFT, it's most definitely describing personal property.

No socialist state in the history of time has had the workers owning the means of production. It has always been the state or government.  We do not have private property in pretty much all of the countries around right now including the USA. It is personal property, the reason is because the government controls what you can do with your property and also taxes you on it. They essentially rent out the land to you. It's not private if a separate entity forcefully restricts what you can do on the property"", ""there isnt a maningful distinction between the two, something can very easily be both.  the dichotomy i *think* you're getting at is personal property vs. private (commercial) property - with the former being something used for personal wants and needs, and the latter being something used for production of commodities.  The answer is that, again, something can be both, because this is all just labels and social relations. if you use your laptop for commodity production and personal entertainment, then its both. socialism is the process of abolition of commodity production, so, if the for-profit market that music is sold on is abolished, then the laptop can no longer be private property because the premises of private property have ceased to exist. private property abolished, no seizure needed.""]"

For example, Plato said, ‚Äúdictatorship naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme liberty.‚Äù The issue in direct democracy is whether the majority will (or public opinion) will conflict with basic human liberties. If the people are sovereign and have the ease of passing legislation that neglects basic human freedom, then tyranny and dictatorship can ensue. It is in documented history that people often seek power for ends that violate human liberties. And this is just what happened when the public majority sought to empower the Nazi political party on the eve of World War II.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe majority viewed Hitler and other key leaders of the Nazi party as heroic and even god-like. This phenomenon, called the cult of personality, happens when a leader, through media avenues, captures the majority public will. Hitler was revered by the majority as a leader who could help pull the country out of post-Treaty of Versailles ruin. Through his popularity and then through brutal force, he was able to gain control of policymaking in Germany with the Enabling Acts of 1933. These acts allowed Hitler to bypass both parliament and the president when creating new German laws. Hitler‚Äôs accumulation of power, thanks to his cult of personality, was the reason he was able to rule as sovereign and eventually commit atrocious human rights violations.     To clarify, participatory budgeting in Chicago is not the same as the brutal dictatorships of the 20th century. But we need to call attention to Plato‚Äôs warning on the most oppressive tyranny arising from the most basic liberty.

Your organization recently released a report analyzing the 500 most viewed, most influential tweets that identify LGBTQ people as, so-called, ""groomers."" The ""groomer"" narrative is an age-old lie to position LGBTQ+ people as a threat to kids, and what it does is deny them access to public spaces, it stokes fear, and can even stoke violence. Ms. Robinson, according to its own hateful content policy, does Twitter allow posts calling LGBTQ people ""groomers""?  Robinson: No. I mean, Twitter along with Facebook and many others have community guidelines. It\'s about holding users accountable to those guidelines, and acknowledging that, when we use phrases and words like ""groomers"" and ""pedophiles"" to describe people, individuals in our communities that are mothers, that are fathers, that are teachers, that are doctors, it is dangerous. And it\'s got one purpose: It is dehumanize us and make us feel like we are not a part of this American society, and it has real-life consequences. So we are calling on social media companies to uphold their community standards, and we\'re also calling on any American that is seeing this play out to hold ourselves and our community members accountable. We wouldn\'t accept this in our families. We wouldn\'t accept this in our schools. There\'s no reason to accept it online.  Porter: So, I mean, I think you\'re absolutely right, and it\'s not, you know, this allegation of ""groomer"" and ""pedophile,"" it is alleging that a person is criminal somehow and is engaged in criminal acts merely because of their identity, their sexual orientation, their gender identity.

Those who manage to get themselves out of such situations deserve to be commended for their strength.  You make an interesting point that I hadn't considered. I don't think that being referred to as a survivor would make one believe the situation was worse; I think the word choice mainly serves to link personal effort to their act of escape from the abusive situation (like you said).  Given how under reported cases of domestic abuse are, don't you think switching our default term to 'survivor' would empower people and make them more likely to report instances of abuse? If you're a victim, you're utterly helpless. If you hear others being referred to as 'survivors', maybe you can view yourself as being a survivor too (thereby suggesting there is a way out)."", ""In your first proposed scenario, there is nothing wrong with referring to the hypothetical person as a victim.   In your second proposed scenario, I agree that given the context of violent assault, we'd classify that person as a survivor as their life was in peril.  In your third proposed scenario, again, I agree that attributing survivorship to an act like that would be disingenuous.  Within your three proposals, there exists a single act of determined harm from which we base our ascription off of (i.e. the person experienced **an** act of robbery \\[**likely not life-threatening**\\] and is therefore a victim).  Would things change if the *single* act was replaced by a *sequence* of actions? If someone keeps robbing you, are you still a victim? Given that robberies can usually be *avoided* rather simply and are not explicitly life threatening, yes, you're still a victim.  What if the *sequence* of actions was in a context that couldn't easily be *avoided*? You might say that people in abusive relationships/households can just leave, but it's not so black-and-white. So the situation cannot be easily *avoided*. Does a *sequence* of actions that one is *forced* to bear justify claims of survivorship? Or is the person still a victim since their life isn't in immediate danger?  Suffering is entirely subjective. Domestic Abuse is a hell that seems inescapable. When one manages to escape, isn't it valid for them to call themselves (and for us to refer to them as) survivors?  People who go through domestic abuse aren't really comparable to people who go through a robbery or people who have their fingers broken (even intentionally). Those who go through domestic abuse often times have their entire worldviews shifted in a perverse manner, with the psychological trauma they receive lasting far longer than the duration of abuse. As such, I think it's important to be mindful of the language we decide to use."", ""Where would you draw the line between 'victim' and 'survivor'?

Separatist sentiment was unquestionably a minoritarian position in the region at the time. Now, were there guys who genuienly wanted to leave? yeah, I think it\'d be silly to say otherwise, but they were a clearly minoritarian group, and the fact that the russian state had to go to such extreme ends to prop them up and create them (including outright hiring mercenaries for them) indicates that their support was limited, and their democratic mandate in donetsk/luhansk even more so.  &amp;#x200B;   yeah I mean it was clearly a minoritarian position at the time. Crimea was one thing, where there was well established public support for separatism for years, donetsk and luhansk didn\'t have anywhere near that degree of support (and the other oblasts in the south and east, where Russia was likely involved in coordinating separatist movements, even less).  &amp;#x200B;   right, they interfered in their internal affairs, I don\'t think it\'s hard to figure out how ukraine would respond  &amp;#x200B;   1. the crimea dispute already achieved this (and obama himself already disavowed ukrainian memberhsip in NATO) 2. ukraine was already bound by the Yanukovych era neutrality laws under the maidan government, and [the maidan government explicitly committed to them after crimea was annexed](https://web.archive.org/web/20220617181259/https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/198372.html). I have to say, if I wanted to ""keep NATO out"" I probably wouldn\'t want to do the one thing that could piss Ukraine off enough that public opinion would swing from generally anti-NATO to overwhelmingly pro NATO.  &amp;#x200B;   Russia already had this. Had they just not taken over Donbas, the Ukrainian government would have stuck to the yanukovych neutrality laws and not reversed itself on NATO membership (the official reversal of position was specifically over the fact that Russian soldiers would not leave Donbas). They had committed to neutrality, even after Crimea was taken (which bound them to neutrality anyhow). AT some point you have to ask yourself ""how will this country react if I keep destabilizing them and taking hteir land?"" and jeez I don\'t think it\'s hard to figure out. You\'re tryign to create this narrative that Ukraine came out of the maidan swinging for NATO membership and it\'s just wrong, they knew that was a risk, and pursued it only after they realized that offering neutrality clearly wasn\'t good enough.  &amp;#x200B;   [You can check the arms transfers sent to Ukraine prior to the invasion here](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html) (click on the link titled ""register""). There\'s this myth that the west turned the ukrainian military into a fleet of gundams and the truth is that the arms they got were small change, a lot of it second hand and until Trump America refused to even send lethal aid, even though it was clearly only going to be used against the separatists, and not at russia proper (again, Russia claimed no relation to the separatists, they can\'t say they had no relation to them and then treat the separatists as russians proper when they get attacked).  &amp;#x200B;  The truth is that Russia made this problem. they could have simply let things go past crimea and none of this would be an issue. even if they felt like creating the separatists and using htem as a proxy against ukraine (which they did, whether you like to admit it or not), the imperative towards peace was to solve it quickly: trade donbas off for recognition of crimea and reestablish friendly relations. The Russian state knew what it was doing here, they knew that setting up a separatist revolt would create tension in Ukraine, that it would empower the craziest and most sadistic portions of Ukrainian society, that setting up the Minsk charade to be impossible to implement and to only make it implementable if the Ukrainian state accepted a total surrender of its sovereignty (via reintegration of the donbas republics with a total check on all foreign and domestic policy and no oversight on elections), that they were putting the lives of ethnic russians and russophones on the line in Donbas by taking it from Ukraine, that having the abusive and parasitic relationship it had with Ukraine for decades was going to inevitably lead it to turn on it, that Ukraine would have no choice but to go to NATO if Russia wouldn\'t pursue good faith negotiation or accept any compromise or even offer a clear path on how to implement Minsk. They refused to do anything about it and rather than accept that they can only complain and blame the west. Their policy is ""escalate to deescalate"" right? Well, they escalated, and then... escalated further and further and further forcing Ukraine to make its deal with the devil with NATO. Had he simply deescalated, we wouldn\'t be here, but he chose not to, and now his people are suffering for it, and many more.  &amp;#x200B;  Have you listened to Putin\'s speeches where he rails against the west?

In a perfect world, duh, then the defendant would prevail on appeal. This is not a perfect world, and judges in appellate courts are not all perfectly balanced automatons who issue objective rulings.

Closing off habeas makes it way easier for states to get away with flaunting federal constitutional law, and closing off habeas is exactly what happens when a circuit court says you cannot prevail without proving factual innocence.

Let\'s approach this from a different angle. What is your alternative to the ""factual innocence"" standard articulated by the court?

Nadine Paulo of Travel Edge buys out the whole Sheldon Chalet in remote Alaska for clients willing to pay $75,000 for up to four people for a three-night minimum stay.  Of course some people would rather buy a property (or a room) at a resort.  ‚ÄúWe have several billionaires who own here,‚Äù Tolman said of Stein Eriksen, where all rooms are individually owned.  Some skiers stay at their rooms all season; some rent them out part of the time.

Also, Smith is absolutely spot on.  I recently read a book about the rise of the landed nobility in early medieval france and it was pretty unequivocal about where it came from.  Basically this or that random person with access to more resources than their neighbors built castles.  These people came to be called Castellans.  Since no one really had the ability to do anything about these castles, Castellans slowly became able to essentially write the social order to their whims via forcing people to be tenants on 'their' land and so on and so forth.  Obviously many of these people wanted their lands and wealth passed onto their children and over a few generations, the landed nobility was born.  Point being they didn't spring fully formed from the ground as nobles.    They were, in many ways, capitalists.

Ticketmaster is estimated to make $15-20M in comparison.

The Pearl Jam case everyone always keeps brings up is from -95. Let\'s just drop it. It\'s not relevant today.    Edit: Just to clarify. The choice of using ""dynamic pricing"" is up to the artists. They choose this because they want to reap the profits that would otherwise go to secondary sellers. That\'s the part that boosts their bottom line. They can do this because they choose to play on Ticketmaster exclusive venues which forces buyers into the ""dynamic pricing"" tickets.

So they don\'t want proof, no. Nor is your inability to provide proof of innocence an indictment. If your alibi is that you were alone at home and no one can testify to it you\'re still not assumed to be guilty. It\'s not proof of your guilt. You\'re not grasping this analogy very well.   Yes, you literally are proven innocent. That\'s how our justice system works. There was never any CREDIBLE REASON to believe you DID THE CRIME. Ergo, you are PROVEN innocent. Because we do not ASSUME YOUR GUILT. How do you not get this?   With no proof this is true, ergo the claim is spurious, and with AMPLE proof it is not true. Provided above. You want additional videos of Uyghurs enjoying their culture in Xinjiang? Because I can find them. It\'s not that hard. You can also find them. On YouTube. Random ass tourists enjoying Xinjiang. Random ass Uyghurs talking about cuisine. Random ass Han enjoying Uyghur culture.    You went, ""They\'re accused of erasing their culture"" to ""native children were killed"". How are these two related? Are you accusing the PRC of killing children in Xinjiang\'s schools? I\'m *trying* to be charitable here, but you are not making it easy.   As a rule, we should define what things are and describe them accurately when engaged in a discussion about things. It is mandatory that children attend schools in almost every nation on Earth. These schools are not prisons. Prisons are a different second thing.  You\'re correct that what we call it doesn\'t negate any atrocities committed there, IF THERE WERE ANY ATROCITIES COMMITTED THERE. Yes.    Guantanamo Bay is literally a prison. It\'s a military prison. No one has any confusion about that. When you ask questions like this you should try to flesh them out into actual arguments.   If I had no credible evidence to suspect you committed the crime in the first place--yes. Unequivocally yes. That\'s HOW our justice system works. That\'s how MOST justice systems work. If the person who accused you of the crime is shown to have fabricated the evidence--also yes. Absolutely yes.   Prove to me that a single school in Xinjiang stripped anyone of their religion. There are more Mosques in Xinjiang now than ever, state-sponsored schools teach new generations of Imams. No one has been stripped of Islam in Xinjiang. Radical terrorists‚Äî  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is the reason you brought up human sacrifice among Indigenous Americans and the reason you\'re arguing about extremism and religion that you think that de-radicalizing Salafist jihadists and stopping them from bombing marketplaces full of civilians and cutting people up with machetes in the streets and assassinating Imams and terrorizing women for not wearing the hijab--that you think this constitutes genocide?   You\'re saying that trying to stop extremism infiltrating your community is the same as genocide? That\'s an argument you\'re making? Because yeah, if you defined it that way--sure. No one does, though. And it would be horribly insulting to the actual victims of actual genocides and it would be a stupid, stupid, ridiculous bar that would make every nation on earth constantly guilty of genocide.   Would make the word meaningless.   &lt;.&lt;   No one is stripping anyone of their religion. You persist in arguing from these strong claims as though they were true and have provided nothing approaching evidence to support them.   Whereas above, linked in the OP, is actual evidence Islam is thriving in Xinjiang. You could also google that, look around a bit. See that Islam is not, in any way, being persecuted in Xinjiang. Radical terrorism is.   If my ""religion"" is that I\'m going to bomb you and murder your family, you could CLAIM that holding me and my group of extremists in custody is some kind of genocide. It\'d be fucking stupid, though. That isn\'t a religion. That\'s an extremist, terrorist ideology. If acting against those constitutes a genocide, EVERY STATE ON EARTH is doing genocide.    No, *it isn\'t*. The requirement is **REASONABLE** suspicion. For them to come into your home and tear that motherfucker apart looking for evidence requires **REASONABLE** suspicion. It\'s in the Fourth Amendment, my dude. It\'s what that WHOLE thing is about.    No. That you have *REASONABLE* suspicion that a COURT of your PEERS would find REASONABLE to WARRANT that ACTION. Otherwise it becomes HARASSMENT, literally. Cops in this country are not allowed to run your pockets and rip up your car any time they *suspect* you. Anytime they have *any reason*. They have to have a *reasonable suspicion* that a JURY and JUDGE would find *reasonable*.   Nope. If they don\'t have a reasonable suspicion, doesn\'t *matter* if you\'re the ""main suspect"", they won\'t get a warrant from a judge. At least, when the shit is working properly.   Nah, it isn\'t. Never how it has. Except in cases where racism and other bullshit was involved. But it\'s not how the principle works. Not how it works for rich white folks or corporations.   Anywho. I think we\'re about done here.', ' Regarding your reply, you can\'t show proof something has never happened. You can\'t prove a negative, most often--and you don\'t have to. The burden is on your opponent to prove the positive. That something DID happen.  That\'s why people are innocent until proven guilty and not guilty until proven innocent--because proving something didn\'t happen is an unreasonable and nearly impossible standard. Proving there AREN\'T invisible pink unicorns on the moon is not a reasonable ask--the reasonable position is to ask the person who claims there are to prove it.  Debunking the weak ass evidence behind the claims of genocide is enough to completely dismiss the claim as spurious. Beyond that, just looking at Xinjiang today, seeing happy Uyghurs playing with happy Han, and Uyghur books in bookstores and Uyghur cuisine on the streets and Uyghur music in the coffee shops and Ugyhur dance is sufficient. Proof positive. No genocide occurred--if it did it was weak and ineffectual as fuck.  If China wanted to genocide Uyghurs they have the power to do that. The entire story of them pussyfooting around to slowly kind of but kind of not genocide Uyghurs is a fucking joke. The fever dream of sinophobes.  If someone says you broke a vase but the vase is right there whole for the whole world to see, we can all safely say you didn\'t break the vase.   That has less than no bearing. You accuse someone of genocide and then don\'t trust them when they show you video evidence it didn\'t happen? That\'s absurd. Of course we should listen to what China says, even if we don\'t believe it--they\'re the one being accused. That would be like accusing someone of murder and discarding their testimony out of hand (or refusing to even hear it) because they\'re the suspect. We have an obligation to listen to what China says in their defense if we want to take this issue even remotely seriously.    Doesn\'t map. The Spanish *were* engaged in a cultural genocide. As was the US in relation to Indigenous populations and Afro-Americans.   China isn\'t replacing the culture of minorities in Xinjiang--so the analogy is meaningless. Fails entirely to map.   Salafism is not native to Xinjiang. Hasn\'t existed there in the thousands of years Islam has been around. Islam has existed in China for almost as long as Islam has existed *anywhere*.   Also worth noting the vast majority of Muslim nations have spoken out in China\'s defense over these accusations of genocide.    Michelle Bachelet met with the leaders of the XUAR, visited a re-education school, visited a prison, toured Xinjiang, and gave it virtually nothing but glowing praise. There is no investigation because there is no *credible claim* that there is *anything* to be investigated.   Leftists were up in arms because the US invaded a sovereign nation. If *Afghanistan* had started re-educating Afghans in a secular and non-genocidal way, leftists would absolutely not be ""up in arms"".  Edit: You raise an interesting point. The US *did* re-educate Afghans. We propped up a puppet government and built them schools and educated them according to our desires. That was not the part most leftists had a problem with. The invading a sovereign nation and sticking around for decades predicated on a lie was.    Yes. The guy\'s commentary is *about* how the article is evidence.    Answered it since the beginning. All you had to do was go look at the article. I am not your tutor.   Because that\'s not how claims of guilt *work*. If you don\'t *know* if someone is guilty, they\'re *not* guilty. If you don\'t *know* if there is an unreasonable and unevidenced thing that exists, it is *as good* as knowing it does not.  It\'s basic logic. Hitchen\'s razor in this case. A claim made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.  Not only is the evidence so weak we can dismiss the claim, we *know* for a **fact** no genocide is occurring. Again, you can go look at Xinjiang. You can go visit Xinjiang. You can watch tourists visiting Xinjiang. You can listen to people who live in Xinjiang. No evidence of genocide, and the positive absence of it. I.e. Uyghurs freely living their lives, and actively engaging in their culture without reprisal. I.e. no genocide. This evidence *strongly precludes* the **possibility** of a genocide. If people are A) not being killed, and B) not having their culture torn away from them but are very much alive and enjoying their culture, we can conclude they are not actively being genocided.   It\'s not rocket science. Trust in the basics here.  The actual Uyghurs who live in actual Xinjiang do not exist in an alternate dimension or on Mars. They can speak for themselves, and you can literally ask them. In person.  My apologies for my tone. I get it. It‚Äôs hard to find those resources. Googling this yields endless results of MSM spreading the same baseless horseshit. You want YouTube videos of random western tourists meandering around Kashgar or Urumqi and talking to Uyghurs who are clearly not experiencing a genocide? I can produce dozens. You want Han and Uyghurs who live in Xinjiang showing how ridiculous the narrative is? Those also exist.   The question you have to ask yourself is what burden of proof that something doesn‚Äôt happen is acceptable to you? Because there exists an unattainable horizon there. I can‚Äôt prove every single existing Uyghur never experienced a single ‚Äúgenocidal‚Äù act, for instance. But that is a very unreasonable burden. Genocide, as defined, is systemic and intentional. A plan or pogrom which brings about the destruction of a national, religious, ethnic, or racial group in whole or in part. I can prove that shit didn‚Äôt happen. Already have.', ' Except there\'s no evidence *of* a genocide, and they\'re not *hiding* anything. Xinjiang is a *tourist* location. Cambodia *was* trying to hide their genocide, they didn\'t celebrate Chinese or Vietnamese culture. The very nature of committing a genocide is that you despise the culture you\'re targeting. There is an ideological motivation behind it. One which can be evidenced. None is evidenced here.   Article is linked in the video. &lt;3   The US lies when they visit Israel. The evidence *there* is everywhere. There\'s a reason most nations on the planet and the UN unequivocally condemn Israel\'s actions regarding Palestine. The evidence in Xinjiang is non-existent. Even the Western media has admitted to that, in so many words.  It went from ""bodily genocide"" claims, which were completely unevidenced, to ""cultural genocide"" claims which are *completely unevidenced*, which are contradicted by China placing Uyghur culutral traditions on the UNESCO world heritage roster, and by them celebrating, promoting, and protecting Uyghur and Kazakh and Hui culture, to claims of ""museumification"" or ""commodification"" of Uyghur culture. Which is meaningless.  Uyghur books are sold in book stores, tourists visit Xinjiang daily, Uyghur dance is celebrated (and China has added it to the UNESCO roster), Uyghur music is celebrated, both are taught in state schools, Islam is taught in state schools, there are more mosques than ever before, etc.   In short, there was never any concrete evidence for the Western media\'s claim to begin with. The accusations came, almost exclusively, from two sources: the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and Adrian Zenz. Neither are reliable. Neither are reputable. ASPI is a think tank that is funded by a dozen military industrial contractors, and the US government directly, and Adrian Zenz is an ideologically motivated notorious propagandist.  The media just doesn\'t care. There is a definite and demonstrable bias where the average Western outlet will lower its standards and uncritically amplify baseless stories about ""enemy"" nations.   The 2014 article from the BBC is important to point out that terrorism, massive, widespread terrorism *really did* exist in Xinjiang according to even Western sources. Mass stabbings of hundreds of people, moderate imams being assassinated in broad daylight, bombings of the capital, all done by ""East Turkistan"" separatists. Radical Wahhabist/Salafist terrorists who the US supported. Who were cutting people\'s ears off for being drunk, who were bullying women into wearing the hijab, who were killing moderate muslim clerics who were speaking out against them.  In this context China *did* crackdown in Xinjiang, after decades of terrorism. They *did* force radicals who expressed terrorist sympathies into schools. They *did* make sure they learned Mandarin, a trade, and the law of China. They *did* imprison those who committed violent acts. And they *admit* to this.   It\'s an example to the world, imo. A humane way to combat terrorism. As China themselves say, you give these people a trade, a future, and they will turn away from extremism. If they have a good life, they won\'t want to sacrifice it doing stupid shit.  We reported on it in the worst possible light. China had a massive terrorism problem and built schools. The US got hit by terrorism and bombed an entire region of the world for twenty years.  Anywho, you can visit Xinjiang if you doubt it. People do. Kashgar and Urumqi are tourist destinations. People hike in Xinjiang. People camp in Xinjiang. People live in Xinjiang. People who live Xinjiang, some of them, make Youtube content. Tourists post videos, etc.  The *worst* thing I\'ve heard from reputable sources was that Uyghurs were getting searched a lot at border checkpoints.  Seriously, the best evidence to contradict the narrative is put forward by China on CGTN. They admit to what they did, they show why they did it, and they show how successful it was.  They also show how much more prosperous and successful Xinjiang is now, including Uyghurs and Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities within Xinjiang.

It‚Äôs not that men are not earning status, but that women are given status by youth and beauty and while they do gain status by wealth, it is far less. Comparatively wealth and power are traits that women give men status for possessing.  This is important because it means there is a certain floor of status that each women will have because every woman has youth at some point. Men do not have such a floor threshold because wealth is not able to be possessed at some point by everyone.

Innovation. Entrepreneurship generally means offering a new product, applying a new technique or technology, opening a new market, or developing a new form of organization for the purpose of producing or enhancing a product.  2. Running a business. A business, as we saw in Chapter 1 ‚ÄúThe Foundations of Business‚Äù, combines resources to produce goods or services. Entrepreneurship means setting up a business to make a profit.  3. Risk taking. The term risk means that the outcome of the entrepreneurial venture can‚Äôt be known. Entrepreneurs, therefore, are always working under a certain degree of uncertainty, and they can‚Äôt know the outcomes of many of the decisions that they have to make. Consequently, many of the steps they take are motivated mainly by their confidence in the innovation and in their understanding of the business environment in which they‚Äôre operating.  https://open.lib.umn.edu/exploringbusiness/chapter/5-1-what-is-an-entrepreneur/', ' Most new companies need capital, and in most small companies that capital comes from the entrepreneur themselves.

Any numbers to prove that. At least where I live most small businesses are not limited liability companies. Which means that the person is responsible for the risks personally. Also the ones that are, are mostly financed by the entrepreneur and friends and family (very often with personal debt) Or did you think that you can just start one, not put in investments yourself and walk to bank to get some debt?.   Yeah when a millionaire starts a libited liability company, your description is right.   ""I have looked at running a small business. One of my friends still has his own. In bad periods, he gets a tech job and uses that to help pay for his shop to get through.""  All small businesses are different. I have a side business where I basically just sell my work.

I have no objections on a semantic level whether stakeholders does or does not include shareholders.  What I object to is the idea that people who do not spend money purchasing a share of a company should in any way be considered ""owners"" in that company or have any decision making powers whatsoever, such as votes. Whether we call these people stakeholders or not is totally irrelevant. But I think you and I can both agree these people are probably best called stakeholders. Unless you like a different definition, I suggest we stick with it.  And if that\'s our definition, then *obviously* stakeholders includes shareholders. It will also include other people. If you want a different definition such that stakeholders and shareholders are synonymous (rather than the one being a superset of the other), we can have that conversation, and it will result in the same underlying conclusions. I\'m just saying I don\'t care what definition we use, as long as we\'re consistent.  But lets back up to the original discussion for context. One person said stakeholders should have votes. The other person replied that only shareholders should have votes. Then you replied that stakeholders would include shareholders. This is an obvious point that no one was disputing, so it was useless to bring it up. The real question is not nor ever was about whether shareholders should get a vote. It was about whether the extra people who are stake holders but *not* shareholders should get a vote. And we say no, they shouldn\'t.  British citizens have a *stake* in american elections, since our foreign policy very much bleeds into theirs. But does that mean British citizens should have a vote in american elections? It is the same with company meetings. I fully comprehend that many people who don\'t own shares in a company have some sort of stake in the company. Maybe the company is their employer. Maybe a company is their supplier, or in a chain of their supplier\'s. Do these people get a vote on the board? no. They don\'t. It\'s not their property.  My neighbors have a stake in how I keep my lawn, since the trees might provide them shade, or block a view.

But it seems as if i replied my original comment to the wrong person.', 'They are indeed shareholders, but my argument never at any point described stakeholders as owners.

Social media at the time wasn't really a thing, this was about 10 years before Facebook brought it mainstream and about 15 years before the advent of the data mining techniques in use today to flag possibly-questionable content for review. At the time, content moderation consisted of manual review and Silicon Valley wasn't nearly as rich or powerful as it is today, so the financial capacity to hire a huge moderation teams was lacking. The prevailing theory at the time was that ably moderating such sites against even illegal content is impossible and that (*e.g.*) DropBox the company shouldn't be held liable should the government find that a few DropBoxes with child porn or pirate bootlegs of the most recent Disney movie escaped its content moderation team's notice. Given this landscape, public opinion in 1996 considered it impossible on a technical level to effectively censor anything other than a very small and limited forum site by viewpoint, and online forums were nerdy stuff that normal people didn't do anyway.  This all changed in the intervening years. Silicon Valley got rich, online forums went mainstream (that is essentially what social media is at brass tacks: a forum site), and new algorithms and data mining techniques were refined and brought into wider use. As a result, the landscape of content moderation and online censorship shifted massively and ¬ß 230 failed to keep pace. Content moderation based on viewpoint therefore thus became common, all while being protected by an outdated and increasingly-overbroad set of legal protections.

I've gotten to the point that I'm able to live a normal life. had I been prevented from transitioning I'd be dead right now.      having been treated for an eating disorder there is a lot of affirming ones feelings. but we try to understand anorexia is a compulsive coping mechanism. we attempt to address the things that cause the compulsion just as we attempt to reduce the harm to the person.   but in the case of gender dysphoria there isn't a diffinive cause, it manifests as early as 3-4 years old. it's just like being gay, it just happens. so we attempt to reduce the harm. and I'd say a pill or a shot, a change of clothes and a different name is pretty damn minor. and it's been shown to be quite effective, it's the best we got. if your proposing some new treatment I'm all ears, but if your just gonna say you don't like it and wanna ban it, your doing more harm than good."", 'Yeah it‚Äôs not trans specific, they built if off of birth control and some other things, but those things are well studied and we know the ramifications.

I don‚Äôt agree with conversion therapy by any means, I don‚Äôt think it should be practiced, gay people really are gay, trans people really are trans, but then there‚Äôs a whole group that are victims of the idea that being a member of an oppressed class makes you inherently virtuous, and variations in gender expression are basis enough to transition. But if you try to tell the latter that they might have something else going on, or that feeling boyish doesn‚Äôt mean you are a boy, that counts as conversion therapy which is wild. It‚Äôs one thing to try to break down their identity and tell them they‚Äôre not trans, but it‚Äôs another thing to ask questions and see how they arrived at that conclusion, and provide them with diathetical tools that can help them see the difference. The goal isn‚Äôt to produce straight cis people, it‚Äôs just to make sure you‚Äôre not jumping into something life changing, and honestly the outcome for a lot of these cases is probably just a gay kid.

A 70 year old CEO who transitions would be accepted into the trans-community and be a valuable community leader. But, especially early in their transition, there wouldn't be much to admire.

Politics is applied morality. Morality is a part of culture and it is not necessarily wrong for a government to make laws maintaining a culture (in fact, personally, I think most governments should take more steps towards cultural custodialship while otherwise remaining secular).   Right, but importantly hanging off a cliff isn\'t harmful to the person *yet*, but instead only harmful if/when they hit the ground.  Perhaps a better spin on the analogy is:  ""If you perform this action (sex), roll a d10000. If it\'s a 1, then for 9 months we\'re going to hook you up to this other person that needs your body to survive. If it\'s any other number, you get $50.""   In this analogy violating the agreement would be a violation of contract law rather than a violation of bodily autonomy. Do you think this is more accurate comparison? This would mean abortion is absolutely not a criminal matter at all, because contract law never is, instead it would be a civil dispute with restitution paid to either the state or to an adoption agency. I think you could convince some of the others with this one.   Sure but there is risk, and that\'s frequently enough for most laws (gun regulations, drinking and driving, licensing requirements, etc.)   This is just a hazard of the argument over right to life vs right to bodily autonomy. In other discussions I\'ve had on this, I\'ve argued that both sides should be heavily invested in artificial womb technology for the purpose of removing the would-be mother and her bodily autonomy from the situation entirely (this opens up other cans of worms, but would solve this immediate issue). Unfortunately, everyone either thinks I\'m joking or weird when I mention it.', 'For whom? The mother, or the child?  That\'s sort of what it comes down to. The child isn\'t aware enough of their situation to make the choice to be aborted. There\'s no way to get their consent.  What follows is two schools of thought:  1) That means abortion is, at its core, unethical, and therefore should be illegal. Any attempt at terminating the pregnancy is trampling the rights of the child, to life and bodily autonomy, by performing an intentionally lethal procedure on them. In succinct terms, it\'s premeditated murder.  2) In the absence of the child\'s ability to consent, they are represented by an advocate, in this case, their mother, much as they would be if they got sick postnatally and required someone to make medical decisions for them. If the mother gives the go-ahead to perform the procedure, it\'s not just her acting in her interests, but in the interests of her child as well.  There are other pro-choice positions, as well, but I\'ve always found those to be... *much* shakier. ""My body, my choice"" forgets there are two bodies involved. ""That\'s not a person"" falls along a line of atrocities historically justified by that sort of thinking. ""It\'s murder, but it\'s okay"" is just... *no*, on all levels.  Personally, I still fall into 1), myself. I don\'t think the notion of acting in a child\'s best interest is very compatible with aborting them in the womb, and with as frightening and confusing as an unplanned pregnancy can be, it\'s still shaky ground to try to build the law on. But with that said, the paradigm at least makes some sort of ethical sense, compared to most pro-choice arguments, which seem pretty morally bankrupt on arrival.']"

Of course, with how diverse Hindu sects are, there are a few which are atheist, but then their definition of hindu boils to a way of life rather than a theological proposition. Any theological Hindu believes in these basic things, else there is nothing which makes you Hindu.  For Sikhism, I think you misunderstand the santa portion. Santa is supposed to be a belief not accepted as epistemologically true because of how unbelievable it is, and I argue other religions are the same', ""I didn't say Hinduism is an imitation.  Both Hindu and Greco-Roman paganism descend from indo European paganism since Indians and Greeks and Romans share common ancestry.   Hinduism is the closest we have to an uninterrupted version of extant Greco-Roman paganism. It's not a descendant but a cousin.  It's like how if you want to understand mammoths, you might have examine an elephant even though modern elephants did not descend from mammoths. They are related, and not direct descendants. Still of interest if you're interested in the extinct thing.  Also, the indo Europeans did not come from Europe proper. They came from the Caucasus and migrated to various places.     Finally, Indus river civilization, the first one in the Indian subcontinent was not 10k years ago. More like 5-6. These people did not practice modern Hinduism. Modern Hinduism is a confluence of indo European paganism and the existing pagan religions of India at the time of indo European migrations. There's actually large difference in Hindu practice based on geography. The northerners (more likely to be indo European in ancestry) are different from the southerners (who are the 'indigenous' driven south by the indo European invasion)  Anyway, you can read about this on the internet. No need to quiz some guy on Reddit.  https://tied.verbix.com/archive/article15.html"", ""Hindu religion is just indo European paganism. There are direct analogs between the Roman Greek deities and the Hindu ones and Hitler was a bit obsessed with paganism in general, just like white supremacists today. It's actually not at all surprising. Even things like the caste system were the norm in the west until paganism ended.  Fun fact... Hindu names of days are named exactly in the same sequence as in Latin.  For example, in Latin languages like French, Wednesday is mercredi... Mercury's day. In Hindi, Wednesday is Budhavar, where Budha is the Hindu name of mercury the planet and mercury/Hermes the god. Budha is the son of father Brihaspati, which is the Hindu name of Jupiter the planet as well as the sky god. Hinduism then collected random other gods along the way, but the core indo European matrix is there.  Like Zeus and Jupiter, Brihaspati  is the teacher /guru of the lesser gods.  There are some disconnects. For the example, the word Jupiter comes from indo European Dyeus pitar, which is actually a separate Hindu god (named Dyauspitar) not associated with Thursday. He's most equivalent to chronos or Uranus.  Anyway, the point is that anyone interested in European paganism would naturally look eastward to India, since there are no European pagans anymore and the closest extant religion that shares an unbroken line to Greek and roman paganism is Hinduism..""]"

And then you start to bring up ""need"" ""killing machines"" and accusing gun owners of ""wanting to kill people for fun""  You are doing nothing but constantly changing the topic   Quote where you brought up any of these standards before the comment where you said  ‚Äúpeople should be punished for violating the law, regardless of what that law is‚Äù. Lets list out just a few of these standards you have set  1) "" if a law is unethical, it should be changed, because enforcing that law would also be unethical.""  2) ""prohibiting things that are BOTH designed to be lethal/cause mass murders and not needed""  3) ""are killing machines""  4) ""are only used to hurt people""  Prove you set those standards before that comment, not after I criticized them and you creating new standards post hoc  Not to mention statements that are absurdly false, if not downright psychotic. You have claimed that not a single person has ever been protected with a gun, that every person with a gun is a sadistic and immoral person that desires to indiscriminately kill people, that my ownership of explosives is illegal... it is fucking absurd. You keep creating new standards post hoc any time any criticism is made   So you agree, alcohol has been shown to be more harmful than helpful due to drunk driving.

Gifts can be planned, people can think about them and discuss them in advance. Usually, the only people actually surprised in the situation of ""pet is announced on holiday"" are small children. Even with small children, usually the whole thing is checked upon in advance by the parents asking or knowing whether or not the kid would be interested in having a pet in the family.  2. A dog as a gift doesn\'t mean people wrap it like a present and put it in a box. The animal doesn\'t even have to be present on that day - It can be as simple as  telling family members ""Hey remember when we talked about getting a dog? Yes we are! We have had discussions with that breeder/shelter and we will adopt a puppy! We don\'t know which puppy, we have to go and look at them first and see if they have one for us. We have an appointment next week!"" And there you go.  3. Legally, pets are almost things. They are sold in stores. If you have one, you are called a pet *owner*. It\'s yours, you can sell it or gift it if you want. Pets have some rights, as it\'s illegal to abuse or abandon a pet. But that\'s it. Buying, gifting or selling a pet is not abusive per se, especially not if the whole deal is for the benefit of the pet. If someone adopts a dog from a kill shelter on Christmas and gifts it to their dad who always had dogs and talked forever about having a dog again, that\'s a net benefit for the dog.', 'Just so you know - I would never ever gift someone a pet for Christmas on a whim.

Or **after holiday season** is over, and people ""regret"" their adopted pet they brought back from their destination country. Or, a while after a **movie aired with a popular animal**, how shelters are flooded with animals of that breed because people all wanted to have a Nemo or a Buddy or something.

Meanwhile you are a teenager and you do have a pet.

Just like some people got a puppy when lockdown started because they felt lonely, without thinking about the consequences once lockdown ends and they are no longer working from home. But like, that\'s not everyone. Yes, some people are assholes and get pets without thinking, buying from sketchy breeders, not taking care of them properly and all that. But at the same time, there are many responsible pet owners.   All people here are saying is: yes it is bad to get a pet without thinking it through. Yes it is a bad idea to surprise someone with a living breathing creature. Yes it is a bad idea to introduce a pet to a new home when there are a lot of people around and it\'s noisy and chaotic. But this has nothing to do with whether or not it\'s Christmas, or any other holiday for that matter.   But it\'s okay to get a pet if you think it through, everyone is on board, you buy from a responsible breeder or adopt from a shelter, you have prepared for the arrival of the pet, you safely introduce the pet to the new home, you are educated and willing to care for the pet correctly.

So the recieving bank ends up being local and could be run by some asshole who could just decide to say ""fuckit we\'re keeping the money"". Or your bank could decide that they\'ve gotten tired of complaints from people who got their money stolen and just refuse to deal with that shitty bank. Or any bank from that country.  And, because the process is basically a bookkeeping exercise, it needs to be verified and reconciled. Which usually takes a while to reconcile all the transactions, make sure the sending bank actually had the money they said they did, etc. Otherwise you ends up with the books out of balance and that\'s BAD!

Marx believed that the dialectic is something to be found in the material world, and humans' conceptions are a mere reflection of the material world. So while we can conceive of the commodity as dialectical due to being both use-value and exchange-value, this conception ultimately derives from a contradiction really occurring in the world. This contradiction is a driver of societal change in capitalism, just as contradictions in past societies ultimately led to their upheaval. Hence Marx's repeated emphasis on a temporal understanding of capitalism and society in general.  The second-to-last paragraph demonstrates Marx's belief that dialectics exist in the material world and lead to real change: "", 'Indeed, but I\'m talking about the ""ends justify the means"" process. The stamping on freedom to find her.  So, all workers in non-productive or destructive jobs are given nothing? I\'m just trying to understand what it means to be paid solely in profit - why not reward labour, instead of a fraction of labour? Also - profit is theft, regardless if the thief is a shareholder or a prole.  Historical materialism, or rather base-superstructure, is a bit of a truism. The economic base determines our attitudes, but our attitudes can change the economic base, but the economic base determines our attitudes, but... With Gramsci\'s cultural hegemony, what precisely are we meant to think of this theory? How isn\'t it obviously true and unhelpful? We can\'t change the economics until we dominate the culture, but to dominate the culture we have to change the economics? Although Marx was coherent, Marxism has become less and less so with every advance.  Yeah, utopian Stalinists. I always chuckle when I see the Marxists who have read more Stalin or Mao than they have Marx - it\'s learning Marxism third-, fourth-, or fifth-hand!', 'On the outset forgive me if I‚Äôm not understanding the nature of what your saying.  So the basis of historical materialism is the mode of production. This base feeds into the superstructure which can then feed back into the base. The developing mode of production is what allows the technological development. Thus putting the metallurgical nature of the tools ahead of the society that even allows this development in the first place is jumping the gun.  A crude example, Iron as a more common and available metal for tools expands the number of tools for workers and how many men can be armed. This feeds back into increasing production and reinforcing the class society through making some more militarily and economically powerful who can make use of it but it didn‚Äôt change the mode of production, it was a change but a quantitative not qualitative one.  So I‚Äôm not sure what you mean with the second paragraph? The three age system isn‚Äôt a system of development. It‚Äôs a system of categorisation. Marxist historical analysis is concerned with how the development of surplus lead to class society and then how the contradictions concerning the means of production gave rise to the next. That societies contain the germ of the next. Egalitarian Neolithic society contained the contradictions that would lead to its own transformation into class society.  This was not a process with hard breaks. The phrase ‚Äúuneven and combined development‚Äù (from Trotsky) captures the process well. Mesopotamian cities took a long time to develop but Iron Age Greek ones developed relatively quickly because of the previous developments. The slave mode of production in Europe is commonly held to end with the Roman Empire but feudalism had its genesis in the Roman Empire and European slavery continued for a few centuries after.  Consider iron tool making took like 700 years to reach Britain from the Middle East. How can anyone make a hard scientific delineation as to one age ending and another beginning? It just has to be a rough category, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing, as it is useful for the sake of talking and clarifying what we are talking about.   Once again I think you‚Äôre back to hitting the nail on the head with the last paragraph but I‚Äôm still not quite sure what you mean. Like that we should analyse the role of bronze, copper, iron etc in the development of society more? Once again the three ages system as far as I‚Äôm aware is basically just a way of categorising rather than explaining societal development and analysing how developments in the superstructure impact the mode of production is already part of the historical materialist method.  Part of the issue with Marxisms input to aspects like archeology, much the same as with economics, is that people don‚Äôt want it to be true. To accept the historical materialist analysis of human development is to accept that for most of human existence we existed without class and thus could do so again. This challenges much of the bourgeoisie liberal understanding of the world that is based on the existence of classes (even though some try to say we live in a post class world) to know that humanity is so changeable. That things aren‚Äôt just the way they are because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how it is‚Äù, that how humans organise themselves, interact and view the world is based on the material processes that have driven history from the first time an ape that could stand used a rock to break something.']"

There isnt a specific word used for people who do this, so again, a ""one line"" answer isnt gonna cut it here. A lot of people are doing that on a variety of platforms and in real life. My guess its mostly three types of people: 1. People who are confused by the current meaning of the word ""incel"" and mistakenly refer to all involuntary celibates as ""incel"", not realizing the harm this causes.  2. People who uphold certain standards of toxic masculinity relating to (male) virginity who see male virgins as pathetic losers, who use the word ""incel"" as an insult to those men. These people dont care or dont know about the current meaning of ""incel"" and just use it as a (sometimes pretty broad) insult of (often virgin) men they see as losers. 3. People who truly believe that most, if not all, adult male virgins are virgins because of the toxic believes they hold, and so dont see a meaningful distinction between  incels and involuntary celibate people. Ive seen this sometimes, but its not very common in my experience.   Are you seriously telling me you\'ve never seen or heard the word ""incel"" misused at all?']"

Public education, and abolition of the distinction between rural and urban. It\'s much broader than any specific management or ""taking over"", but subjecting big business and industry to democratic control tends to produce a Western European style result.

You might be looking for something closer to [reductio ad absurdum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) or an [appeal to extremes](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Appeal-to-Extremes).  Now, the reason I am against a cap is multi-fold.  Like, let\'s just look at stocks (and I\'ll pick on tesla for a moment.)  In the last year, it\'s dropped 55% in price.  Elon sold a bunch of his stocks, and the surplus supply caused other people\'s asset\'s to drop.  In short, stocks are really volitile, and should a small spike cause a person to have to sell them, preventing others to get money (especially bad when you look at retirement accounts)?  Will we just do it at tax season, causing a stock market slump every April 15th?   Look at a person who owns a business I used as an example.  The business has assets, but the business is worth more than just the sum of it\'s assets, and you can\'t just go ""hey, force them to sell ownership in the company"" as that can cause the company to change tactics.  So, until a company is publicly traded, businesses are practically one discrete unit (or at least have a 50% minimum).  And after they are public, the selling of shares can drop the value other people have invested in the company.  What about art?  Can I claim my art is worthless or valuable based on what is convenient to me and my friends?  Let\'s look at families for a second.  I am married.  Can our household have 2 billion?  What about our kid?  can we get 3?  Can I a give someone a million to let me ""adopt"" their kid, and still let them raise their kid so I gain more billions?  What about trusts.  Can I put my money in a trust instead, so the trust owns the money and the trust pays to provide for me and my family?   In short, the concept is great, but just saying ""your worth should be capped"" misses tons of weird cases.  I would rather all income be taxable at the same set of rates (no different stock rates vs income rates).  All purchases of any sort after a certain dollar amount are also taxed heavily (like, a purchase of a house over 10 million has a 10% sales tax, and goes up 1% for each million after it (yes, even past 100%).  If a person manages to buy something small, and turn it big, cool.  When they sell, they will pay the tax on it, but until they sell, it\'s just ""theoretical"".  Some assets though, do have easily determined values.  Boats, cars, houses.  Tax them, and make the taxes a higher percent the more valuable the item is.', ' I dont see how a cap punishes taking risks. If you take risk and manage to get a few 10k to go up in  value to go up to the cap (say a 10M nest)  then whatever the risk paid off but why should that benefit be infinite especially for a program meant for ""retirement"" not wealth generation    You are assuming that works out ok over the length of 45 years. That is a crazy assumption. Getting lucky once is one thing but doing so over that stretch of time is something else.', ""It absolutely does create an earnings cap. When the ratio crosses 100, then your tax rate is 100%. That's literally a cap. If your business practices do not conform to my arbitrary line in the sand, I take all your money away""]"

Some professionals have tried to diagnose Forrest Gump and from the articles I\'ve seen, most arrive to the conclusion that he has Autism and either a mild case of cerebral palsy or perhaps had polio, hence the need for his leg braces as a youth.  Sure severe Autism can be mistaken for Downs Syndrome and we are talking about the 60\'s and 70\'s when professionals and certainly the public didn\'t have as much information on these conditions.  However, I think it\'s pretty clear to the audience and to anyone interacting with Forrest that he\'s not ""retarded"", even in 60\'s and 70\'s terms.  Rather, I think he is what people at the time would have referred to as slow or dimwitted.  And so, I think that\'s where the argument above starts to fall apart, because the people in Forrest\'s life don\'t treat him like he\'s ""retarded"" they treat him like he\'s slow, or a ""dimwit"" and that level of interaction, even in that time period, is doing to be different than how those same people would interact with a ""retarded person"".    I dare say that people of that time would have looked upon and treated a ""slow dimwit"" with more respect and equality, viewing them closer to being an equal, though not quite, while someone with a form of Down\'s Syndrome would not have been treated like a near peer equal the way Forrest is.  The relationships Forrest has with others to me is revealing of how people view him as more than a ""retarded person"" and more as a ""slow, dimwitted, naive guy"".  So you could say that Jenny thought Forrest was very naive and you\'d be right, she\'s right in many senses, but I think it\'s incorrect to say she views him as ""retarded"" and so the arguments start to unravel a bit with that.']"

He'll say DeSantis is a liar and won't actually pardon him, because he's afraid of Trump and wants him out of the way, so they all have to vote for whatever Trump is on the ballot instead.  Or even dumber, he'll get offended and say that DeSantis offering to pardon him implies that DeSantis believes he's actually guilty, and probably a deep state RINO or something too.

Republicans have pretty much raised the white flag on Obamacare and Dodd-Frank except for some minor changes. Obama was the first President to push for gay rights and gay marriage just got codified.  Most of Obama\'s legacy (outside foreign policy) survived intact   I brought it up mainly because I feel like the narrativization you build in your post isn\'t particularly accurate   Yeah they did? They shut down the Third New Deal. And the Fair Deal. And the New Frontier. LBJ needed a super majority to implement the Great Society do to the economic conservatism of his Southern wing.   My point was that the Northern New Dealers were never seriously considering a Civil Rights push until the late 1940s beyond perhaps anti-lynching laws.   My point is that from the 1950s onwards their was a significant gap between Democrat support in Congress (Democrats would almost continuously Congress for the next 40 yrs) while losing the Presidency more often than not. There was a clear inability within the party to unify their supporters at the Presidential level.   Indeed, and that consensus mostly survived the Reagan era. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Food Stamps.   I don\'t think de-industrialization was really caused by financial deregulation. It was mostly just automation with a little bit of outsourcing. My overall point though is that its hard to really simplify the changes in the ""neoliberal"" economy to just deregulation, tax cuts, and social spending cuts. Overall taxes and social spending remained fairly stable. Certain parts of the economy faced more regulation other parts face less.  And regardless, Obama and Bush re-regulated finance.   Again not sure if that\'s really true on net   There are tech regulations, and the reason we have large tech companies isn\'t due to a lack of regulation. I\'m not sure if its really the center of debate around corporate regulation. I would agree that it takes up the largest space in our political discourse though.   Has MAGA really had any institutional victories? Like SCOTUS is conservative don\'t get me wrong but their like traditional Conservative. The Center of the court is Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, and they\'re a lot closer to like Mitt Romney\'s politics than Trumps.  If anything the MAGA movement has contributed to more Republicans excised from most major institutions and institutional Republicans (David French types) leaving the party.   Honestly, I think once Trump\'s power over the party breaks. Pretty much every ranking official (except for some of the Freedom Caucus) hates him. Once they know the fever has broke, they\'ll pounce. The MAGA populism will break within the GOP. I think some of their ideas will probably make it into the GOP mainstream although their most radical probably won\'t.   I think that some of their concerns (cancel culture, identity politics) have already made it into the mainstream. George McGovern was crushed in 72. But many of his ideas were eventually adopted by more establishment figures. I expect something similar will happen with Trump.   Probably not immediately. Although I think GOP states will probably slowly liberalize their laws as they realize their unpopular. Eventually, a bipartisan bill will attract 60 votes like with Gay marriage.']"

Engels asserts in Anti-Duhring that not only is the personal domination of the state and capitalist class eliminated, but *also* ends the *im*personal domination of the means of production, as they are transformed into ""the means of their emancipation"".  The only way out here is to do something like you are trying to do: use authority to mean different things in different contexts.  This does solve this problem, of course. But that is also the answer anarchists explicitly gave Engels when he was writing *On Authority,* and which he rejected:   In other words, the anti-authoritarians were never calling for an end to the kind of ""authority"" Engels described, such as the need to establish a schedule to keep a factory running.  Instead, they distinguished the exact same senses you did between the authority of arbitrary power imposing their will onto the workers, and the ""authority"" of the workers managing their own affairs.  Engels entire argument against the anarchists only works if he pretends that no such distinction is possible.  *On Authority* is a thoroughly anti-Marxist text, and its arguments are rooted in ignoring the reality of class division.', 'First. The idea that Engels, of all people, took Marx out of context is wild to me.   Engels knew Marx personally and worked with him extensively, including in real party politics. The idea that someone who never knew Marx could have authority over Engels\' understanding of Marxist principles is either naive or self-aggrandizing. I\'m not sure which.  You are also attributing beliefs to Engels that he did not express in his writing. Engels is not advocating for the subjugation of the worker through the means of production. Your interpretation is incorrect and that might be because of your personal lens.  I\'m going to bet, like most Anarchists, your definition of what ""authority"" is, is something different than what Engels and Marx would mean by authority. And Marx\'s arguments with Proudhon and Kropotkin should give you some hint of that.  ""On Authority"" argues that the concept of ""authoritarianism"" is meaningless and used to criticize any form of leadership or organization that imposes its will on others. It can be applied to any organization or government.  Engels is not ignoring any of the class conflicts.  When Engels is referring to Revolution as the most authoritarian thing there is, it is because there is one class of people using what they have at their means of disposal as a weapon against another. It is violent, and it is intentional to make them give up their power in society.  Therefore a dictatorship of the proletariat would be inherently authoritarian as well under this definition, because a government for the people, would naturally suppress the selfish urge of the individual to garner more power for themselves. The fucking Paris Commune would have been considered authoritarian.  Thus Engels disregards this criticism entirely, and a lot of Marxists do as well. Because it\'s absolutely meaningless.  It\'s why a lot of socialists just roll their eyes when authoritarianism is brought up.  In any organization you do, where there is dissent, any decision you make,  will be considered authoritarian by *someone*. Good or bad.  This is what Engels is railing against.  I could tell my kids to go to bed at a certain time by the definition of ""authoritarianism"" that many people use. ""Unearned Hierarchies,"" etc.  As a former syndicalist, hierarchies are not the issue, they are a tool - just like government, just like a currency. The issue is the mechanics of the system at large, pooling resources into a small group of people\'s hands. Which has nothing to do with their hierarchy, though that is certainly a symptom. That has to do with their ownership and their ability to influence the government to enforce said ownership.', 'I am not saying Engels misinterpreted Marx. On the contrary, I think he interpreted him correctly, and quote him presenting this interpretation on *Anti-Duhring.*  Rather, I am saying Engels, whether through laziness or spite, abandoned basic Marxist principles here to make bad faith arguments he knows fail, as they are strikingly inconsistent with the rest of his body of work. *On Authority* is Engels acting as the angry polemicist wanting to attack his rivals with whatever argument he can, no matter how bad or incompatible it is with Marxism.  I would also not, and did not, say that Engels is ""advocating"" for workers to be subjugated to the means of production. On the contrary, it is clear in *On Authority* that he considers this subjugation to be *necessary*, and could only be abolished by ""abolishing industry itself.""  What I am saying instead is that this claim is in direct contradiction with what he says in *Anti-Duhring*, where the authority of the means of production is ended, and workers instead turn it into a means of their emancipation.  So we are left with two options here: either Engels is contradicting himself, or he is using authority in more than one sense; one which is necessary and inherent to industry, and another which can and must be ended by proletariat.  If it is the former, then Engels is simply wrong and anti-Marxist. To say that workers cannot turn emancipate themselves from the domination of the means of production is to say that the socialist cause is in vain.  If it is the latter, then Engels entire argument falls apart, because he directly scoffs at the anti-authoritarians making the same exact point to him at the time, saying ""These gentlemen think that when they have changed the names of things they have changed the things themselves. This is how these profound thinkers mock at the whole world.""  In either case, it is also clear that talking about ""authoritarianism"" is not meaningless, because we really after after ending authority in the proper sense.  This is, by the way, the position anarchists had at the time too. Bakunin explicitly recognized that some types of authority are completely fine, and he had no intention to oppose them. Quoting from [*God and the State*:](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/michail-bakunin-god-and-the-state)   In other words, Engels argument is built on a strawman. And even linguistically, his position is inferior, since his argument depends on applying the same word for two meanings. Rather than anarchists pretending there is a difference between the same thing by changing the name, Engels is pretending no difference exists between two different things (the authority of capitalists and the ""authority"" of worker\'s self-management) by applying the same name.  You also misquote Engels in *On Authority*. He does not say that a revolution is where ""one **class** of people use what they have at their means of disposal as a weapon against another."" Rather, the direct quote is that the revolution is ""the act whereby one **part of the population** imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles.""  The explicit exclusion of class character here reflects the implicit exclusion in the argument itself.  Engels is trying to equivocate the act of the proletariat in revolt against the bourgeoise with the counter-revolutionary actions of the bourgeoisie, since ""both use rifles.""  This is a frivolous argument thought that only works when we view these two groups merely as two populations at war with each other, and ignore the reality that this is one subjugated class in revolt against their oppression, and the other class trying to reimpose that subjugations.  Calling one of these sides libertarian and the other authoritarian then is not merely playing around with words, but recognizing the real class analysis of what is happening here, which Engels is purposefully ignoring for purposes of a cheap shot.  A socialist revolution is one of liberation, and our language and science must reflect that. We must keep in mind that we are fighting for very different ends, and our organizations therefore also require very different anti-authoritarian structures, unlike the authoritarian structures of the state and capital which are unsuitable for our purposes. Hence the reason why ""the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes.""']"

Classical Liberalism is no more acceptable today than authoritarianism, for obvious reasons.   The desire of ""conservatives"" to hearken back to the days of institutional racism and sexism, unregulated fascist imperialism, nationalist wars and colonialism, and mercantilist trade policies is abhorrent.  Granted, it was better than absolute monarchies, heretic-hunting churchs, and slavery. Hurrah for that.', 'The premise is that Progressives and Conservatives are both Liberals.

Neither of those two examples are examples of present day Liberalism or it\'s two flavors: conservative and progressive.', 'Classical Liberalism is the form of Liberalism spread around the world by the British Empire, and while it had a LOT of positive influences, it also included institutional racism and sexism, colonial exploitatation, laissez faire capitalism that permited even such abhorrent practices as child labor, and it reinforced legal class divisions that limited social mobility across generations.  I\'m focussing on some of the negative aspects to highlight just how ignorant a person is when they say they are a ""classical liberal,"" because it has no place today in the US or the UK or anywhere, I think.  If one were contemplating public policies that could be adopted today, then we wouldn\'t turn to ""Classical Liberalism"" instead of Liberalism as it is known today.  And there is a reason why Libertarianism is a fringe ideology and it is because they assume that we could adopt laissez faire economic policies and avoid the danger of corporate fascists upending the republic.

I wouldn\'t make them exclusively for any particular race, but for kids in general who are underperforming compared to national norms. Similarly, I\'m not against employers or colleges stepping up recruitment drives in communities that don\'t apply very often into those programs. That makes sense, because you want the best people from everywhere. What I\'m against is giving preferences in admissions or hiring to any race, gender, religion etc.    No, it was thrown out because the Biden administration withdrew it. And it\'s ludicrous to call that a ""margin of error"" when consistently across all the deciles blacks were admitted at a far higher rate than Asians. Seriously, you think that just accidentally happened? Every year, CNN highlights the few elite students that are [accepted at all Ivy League schools](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/12/us/ashley-adirika-ivy-league-colleges-cec/index.html). Want to guess what these students invariably have in common? Is that a coincidence?     OK, if your argument is that the numbers are so small it doesn\'t matter, I\'m not sure how that is relevant. In a male dominated field like engineering, a college program or a company typically get a very small % of applications from women. And denying them all on the basis of sex might only affect a few people, and be within a ""rounding error"", but it would still be wrong. And illegal.     I don\'t care about that. If whites are benefitting from AA, then that\'s wrong too.   What I do know from a personal level is that my own daughters, who are half white/half asian, put ""white"" or ""decline to answer"" on their college applications to prevent being discriminated against. And that\'s wrong. In fact, that checkbox shouldn\'t even be on applications.', ' Why not? If you know for sure one race is historically disadvantaged and continue to bare the brunt of those wrong ANS still face discrimination in hiring and application processes, why is is not okay to address that head-on? Why do we have to pretend that history and those biases don\'t exist? That\'s what you\'re asking for here.  I was pointing out the 20 student (0.5%) discrepancy not as direct defense of the program but as ridicule for the people who moralize about all the white and Asian student who feel the need to lie on their applications. Those students and those parents are being ridiculous. At the highest level, just 20 seats out of several thousand might have ended up with black students rather than another ethnicity. If you sent out a hundred applications to a hundred schools and half of them you marked white and half you marked black, you\'d never notice a difference in acceptance.  Well, that\'s according to the Yale numbers anyway. In reality, even with AA on the books, we know that\'s not really true. Even today black adults have to put in on average 50% more applications to get the same number of job offers as their *equally qualified* white counterparts.  And we\'re not even talking about the fact that even in the DoJ filing they make it clear that the Academic Index is only one of many considerations. Don\'t you think landing in the top 10% of the Academic Index is more impressive if you grew up in an unstable environment versus an upper-class home? Of course it is. And of course black students will face that more often.  How much of that 60% includes that consideration? *Then* tell me what difference AA made.  Because again, and you don\'t seem to be addressing this, those implicit biases DO exist. Some trial and error with tutoring programs now isn\'t going to change the public unconscious opinions about black people within a single generation, and tutoring obviously isn\'t the only issue. Do you just kinda say ""tough shit"" to the generation or few of black folks in between the repealing of AA and when you hope public bias changes?  Because I\'d imagine a higher rate of unemployment and career advancement at the hands of implicit biases would be a self fulfilling prophecy. Wouldn\'t THAT weigh in people\'s biases?  You can\'t in one breath say ""stereotypes exist for a reason"" and then not understand that THAT\'S exactly the kind of thinking that handicaps people who want to do better with their lives.', ' Again, it just seems like folks are bad at statistics. Yes, of course there\'s a random chance for everyone that they\'re gonna grow up in a shit environment and yes of course this includes white people. But it\'s NOT by chance that this happens more to black people. And secondly, racial discrimination and implicit biases are NOT problems white people face.  Simer: black people have all the same problems poor whites can have PLUS extra problems on top of that.  And hey, you can means test AA all you want, and many schools DO ALREADY consider rough upbringing and poverty on applications and scholarships. That\'s not news. So every poor person already has that leg up. AA aims to address that extra difference in struggle placed on minorities by biases in hiring.   Oh dude, I\'ve brought this up so many times already and you\'re JUST NOW getting around to considering reality?  There a ton of experiments in this, I\'ll list just a few:  DOI 10.1257/0002828042002561  DOI 10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00035.x  DOI 10.1111/j.1573-7861.2011.01285.x  When it comes down to it, these experiments are really all it ought to take to prove that AA is necessary. If you have to have a BETTER resume than a white person to get the same respect, that\'s a huge obstacle.   You\'re doing that thing again, where I say ""black kids applying to an Ivy League school"" and you jump straight to ""inner city graduates who can\'t read in Baltimore."" You have to get it in your head that we\'re talking about two different subsets of the population here. Why Baltimore? Is that supposed to be representative of black college students? Or black students applying to ivy league schools?   How is equal access to higher education NOT exactly that preparation? How is a better educated black population NOT going to improve things? Again, this isn\'t an artificial leg up and folks gotta stop parroting that tired talking point. This is a direct address to the implicit bias against them. YOU think it\'s a safe bet that black students aren\'t as prepared for the ivy leagues/college as white and Asian students. That kind of bias is an obstacle specifically for POC students. AA addresses specifically that bias.  It\'s not a bandaid, it\'s a direct treatment of a symptom that has long-term benefits for the perception of future generations. It materially changes the standing of POC compare to whites. It\'s the ONLY thing being done to address racial inequalities directly.']"

This is why I don‚Äôt think eliminating meat from our diet at a global scale is realistic. I like the way you sum up your point though, a person would have to be pretty entitled to think indiscriminately killing animals is preferable to trying new things. So, yes, an animals life is more important.   It wasn‚Äôt necessary to kill other humans in order to survive, but a leading theory on why we thrived so much after the ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù of fire is that our bodies were able to process the nutrition from cooked meat easily, and since some of those internal systems and resources were no longer necessary for digestion they could be diverted to other uses, like developing our brains at a faster pace. So it may have been necessary to eat meat in order for our society to blossom. Is it fair to cast that in the same light as killing each other and many bad things that happen today?  Of course I‚Äôm not saying all clothes are made from animals, but something you‚Äôre wearing right now required killing other animals. If you showered today‚Ä¶dead animals.

The only thing that necessitates capitalism is a unit to store value, money. Capitalism is all about voluntary exchange. People have been doing it for 10s of 1000s of years. You voluntarily exchange your labor for money, voluntarily exchange money for some good or service. Socialism is coercive in nature. It forces people to give up what they‚Äôve worked for, what belongs to them and it prevents entrepreneurs from freely associating with laborers in labor-for-wage system. No institution is eternal, monopolies will breakdown eventually. Workers can form labor unions to negotiate with employers.  Trying to describe it as free market = no oppressive forces, is completely bad faith. Capitalism has worked tirelessly to destroy Socialism in the 20th century.  Again, capitalism isn‚Äôt a thing, it is the absence of a system. Socialism is not nearly as efficient at allocating resources, that‚Äôs why it lost out. Read economic calculation problem.

If you track your period closely and get a pregnancy test the first day you are late then you are already four weeks pregnant. This gives you two weeks to schedule and complete an abortion procedure.   Many women do not have regular periods and would not even notice that something about their period was unusual until six weeks. Some women experience a total halt to their periods as a side effect of their birth control and would not have a simple means to notice their pregnancy until way beyond six weeks.   Pregnancy tests are also fairly inaccurate until about a week before somebody\'s missed period. So even if somebody decided to take pregnancy tests every week of their life, that still only grants them three weeks of time to schedule and complete an abortion procedure.

We followed up by asking: ‚ÄúWould You Favor or Oppose the United States Officially Declaring the United States to be a Christian Nation?‚Äù The findings were striking.  Overall, 62 percent of respondents said they opposed such a declaration, including 83 percent of Democrats and 39 percent of Republicans.
