Why are you saying it's impossible when we literally do it for K-12?   Yeah, and? Taxes pay for K-12 as well. Your point?   So that they can send their kids to college without having to pay for it independently out of pocket. Instead it gets paid for through taxes. I suggest taxes on the rich, that way even middle class families won't have to pay a dime for it.  You know, people in this country used to work and fight for the next generation to have it better than they did. Free higher education would make it better for the future than we have it right now. Why do you fight so vehemently against a good thing?"", 'Yeah I really don’t care if you’re condescending or sarcastic. I mostly found it amusing you’re telling me to do more research and that I’m not listening, when you don’t understand the legal system as well as you think you do.   Let’s try this one more time. The 6th circuit case you keep citing was regarding one specific rally, in which Trump never uttered any phrases which could be construed as encouraging violence. He also mentioned to his crowd to not hurt the protestors. These two factors led the appellate court to strike down the lawsuit.   January 6th and other rallies are entirely different because he *did* utter phrases which can be construed as inciting violence. His usage of the term “peaceful” could very well be mitigating, but that’s for a jury to decide. The 6th circuit case in no way is precedent that he can’t or won’t be charged, as you keep saying.   If you want case law that is directly relevant to Jan. 6th, try this on for size. A federal judge earlier this year rejected Trump’s efforts to dismiss a lawsuit, saying the court believes Trumps speech that day was not necessarily protected by the first amendment, because it incited violence.   https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-lawsuits-donald-trump-48fef5775a0043339fb38aa84ad419be  That ruling is currently being appealed to the DC circuit, but there’s a gem in there as well. The Trump lawyer recently told one of the appellate judges that civil suites should be barred because it sets a bad precedent for future presidents, but admitted that “Trump could theoretically face criminal liability over the riots.” Which is another good point: there are legal differences in civil cases, like the one you keep citing, and criminal ones. But his own lawyer admitted he could face criminal liability.   Trumps other statements that day behind closed doors are highly relevant. In order to prove incitement, prosecutors need to show intent. If you listen to Trumps statements throughout the day, it can be dismissed as Trump being Trump. On the other hand, his actions behind closed doors add context to his state of mind, and you’re flat out wrong if you think they’re not relevant to a charge of incitement or conspiracy.   I honestly couldn’t care less about the house impeachment managers editing a video. Impeachment is a political process, not a criminal one. And if that video was shown in criminal court, you don’t seem to understand how exculpatory evidence works anyways. The Brady rule only requires that the government hand over evidence that could show a defendants innocence, not that they themselves have to show it in court.  If Trump is ever indicted on incitement and/or conspiracy charges, prosecutors can use videos of his statements that day without mentioning his peaceful claim. Maybe they would to preempt the defenses argument, but prosecutors don’t play the role of defense attorneys…  I’m well aware that people are fanatical in their wish to see Trump go to prison. But it’s up to DOJ, not two people on Reddit who don’t have law degrees.', "" Please make your argument. How did the author define a healthy marriage. What characteristics? What are your reasons to believe that women seeking abortions and their sex partners share those characteristics?  I need a citation that in the referenced studies that the parents who were married wanted to be married to each other. It is your claim, so you can define what that means? Wanted to be married on the day they were married? 50 years of uninterrupted marital bliss? Whatever it is, please provide your citation that in the studies that demonstrated that children of married bioparents do better that the bioparents wanted to be married.    You mean all other things being equal. Actually, I am getting confused by your argument. Are you arguing that the children of a single woman who got married and got a marriage payment would not be better off if she got married and didn't get the marriage payment. Or are you arguing that the children of the woman would be better off if she got the payments even if she was married?   Sorry, typo. I meant to say: You seem to think single parents can't just go marry the other parent.    Because the data show this is less than ideal for the average child. If I am going to make these levels of changes to society, I really want to aim for the best possible situation.    I mean, how often do you think that happens? Laws don't exist to make sure that every possible thing in your life is already laid out for you, including everything that is highly unlikely to happen. People have to live their own lives. If some rare exceptional thing happens, you may be faced with rare exceptional choices. But for the hundreds of millions of other people, the law can provide some practical, broad support.    I don't want to incentivize gestation. I want all parties to get what they want. PL - no abortions. PC - more choices. Society - more and better citizens.  Society is not satisfied with women gestating and then abandoning children in garbage cans.    What are you talking about? Can you show me any US state marriage law that requires people certify they love each other? Are you serious with this?   Look, if you want to look for creative solutions, you cannot have such an inside the box attitude.    I think you will not get society on board. Paying women to give birth but having no expectations on what happens to the child after that. Perhaps all the claims of PCs about PLs not caring what happens to kids once they are born is just projection.    This is just discrimination. You can hire the best person for a job. The data show married bioparents are the best parents for kids.    Except marriage ties together two people's financial situations. The man is incentivized to marry the woman, as they now both have claims to the payments.    I already said either way. Are you in with no abortion restrictions? It seems like no.    Good thing this never happens, even if everyone is trying to get there.    The problem with this suggestion is why should I do it? Tell me why I should give money to a woman just because she gave birth. That seems like a horrible idea. Women would literally give birth, get the check, and throw the baby in the trash and get pregnant again. I am not paying for that.    Tell you what. If you want this, lets go to the mods and ask for a rule that anything that happens after birth is off limits on this sub. No more PCs saying that PLs don't care what happens after birth, because it is not about abortion and banned. Or is this a silly thing to say? I hope my point is getting clearer.""]"

Show me where Marx says that the lower stage of communism is the complete end of the capitalist mode of production and a complete end of the state. Show me further what Marx calls the phase before the lower phase of communism. I cannot find any writing to this effect. What I do find is Marx\'s explanation that the lower phase of communism is the phase after the revolution removes the bourgeoisie from power and also that removing the bourgeoisie from power creates the DotP, leading any reasonable interpretation of Marx\'s theoretical timeline toward communism as an event (revolution) that produces phase 1 (lower phase) that subsequently produces phase 2 (higher phase).   Yes. Section 3 in particular goes into the critique that you seem to be confused about. Marx is not arguing that ""a state"" is the problem, but rather that the Gotha Programme literally was seeking concession from ""the state"", that is, the bourgeois state, to build proletarian socialism within a bourgeois state, an impossible task.  Section 4 shows us what the alternative is (and it\'s not immediate statelessness)   Marx criticizes reformists who believe they can liberalize the state enough to allow socialism to flourish inside it. He explicitly states here that the alternative is literally subordinating the state, not destroying it but rather revolutionizing it.    Literally spelling it out for us right here. Marx refuses to answer specific questions in the abstract because it must be arrived at through empirical struggle. Nevertheless, the DotP is the period of transformation between capitalism and communism and it is characterized not merely by its economics but also it politics in which the state exists and is dominated by the working class.   I know.   No. The lower phase of communism is literally the society that is born from the revolution and the establishment of the DotP, such a society ""emerges from capitalist society, which is thus in every respect, economically, morally and intellectually, still stamped with the birth-marks of the old society"". There is no theoretical phase between capitalism and lower communism. Lower communism IS the transitional phase.   Where? I don\'t see this in the text.   I think this is a deliberate misreading of them. Note that neither Lenin nor Stalin refer to the third stage in your selected quotations. Socialism and Communism as terms are still being used interchangeably here. Nowhere will you find anyone claiming that labor vouchers are a prerequisite for the lower stage of communism, and equally nowhere will you find anyone that has any theory for how labor vouchers can be managed and distributed without a state.  You seem to be inventing a third phase where none exists for the express purpose of committing the No True Scotsman fallacy. Marx did not create prescriptions nearly as precise as you are putting forth. The lower phase of communism has always been the end of the bourgeois state, the repression of reactionary forces, the implementation of planning to replace the duality of private property and profit as the governing forces allocating labor, and the distribution of socially necessary goods and services to the members of society through that planning process instead of for profit. And what do we see in every revolutionary project since the Soviet project? The abolition of private property, the disenfranchisement of the bourgeoisie, the allocation of labor to that which is socially necessary both for maintenance of the proletariat and the advancement of society beyond scarcity, the free allocation of socially necessary goods and services (food, medicine, education, healthcare, etc) without the governing forces of profit driving social distribution, the raising up of the poorest of society far and away beyond anything capitalism has ever done, and the vigilance (and in the case of the USSR and Yugoslavia, failure thereof) to prevent (local and global) reactionary forces from revising the program and redirecting it towards the establishment of bourgeois power and maintenance.  Your insistence on your definitions leads you to the conclusions that a) the last 100 years of revolutionary work has amounted literally to nothing but the continuance of capitalism, b) that the lower phase of communism can never occur until all global reactionary forces have been neutralized and made impotent, and c) all currently existing revolutionary projects are not in fact socialist projects but are capitalist projects with socialist aesthetics and ambitions.  None of these conclusions are useful. They are definitional cul-de-sacs that attempt to preserve some form of perceived linguistic purity that is a stand-in for theoretical purity when literally the entirety of the actual cadre of practitioners have developed their understanding through actual empirical observation and analytical reconciliation and refinement. In the worst case, they lead one to work against actual anti-capitalist projects that are building socialism and create the conditions for barbarism justified by artificial theoretical purity, like Hoxha, like ultra-leftists, or like Trotsky.', 'Your definition of Socialism is way off. Socialism is not government control. Socialism is worker control.   Capitalists believe that production should be done by private companies owned by individuals and socialists believe that production should be should be owned by the workers as a collective.', 'Socialism is not an ""it""']"

3	2151	3_abortion_fetus_abortions_pregnancy	['abortion', 'fetus', 'abortions', 'pregnancy', 'zef', 'pro', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'life', 'unborn']	['No it’s not. The point of abortion is to end pregnancy. If we could someone end a pregnancy and keep the baby alive in a machine you have still had an abortion.', 'Like I said, abortion is not a right', ' So anti-choice people saying abortion is murder *doesn’t* stoke division?  “Reproductive rights” doesn’t only mean the ability to reproduce. It covers all aspects of a woman’s right to reproduction and bodily autonomy including the right to terminate a pregnancy. And yes of course adoption is another option, but the same people who are anti-choice hypocritically don’t want to adopt orphans themselves. If anti-choice people want every woman to give up their baby for adoption rather than get an abortion, then go ahead and adopt children yourselves.  Abortion also doesn’t just cover healthy pregnancies. Total abortion bans also prevent women from getting an abortion if they have an unviable pregnancy such as entopic pregnancies. It is literally impossible for a baby to carry to term in an entopic pregnancy, but because hospitals in states where there’s total abortion bans have to be careful about the legality of it they have to deny women with entopic pregnancies from getting an abortion. Which then leads to those women getting unnecessarily sick, bleed out profusely, and have to go through that traumatizing experience.  But it doesn’t matter what you and I believe around the morality of abortion. 7 SCOTUS judges codified Roe into law, including conservative ones,  not because of moral reasons. They did it because those 7 judges recognized it didn’t matter how much you try to ban abortion, women will attempt to induce abortions regardless. So all that abortion bans do is force women to seek illegal means of getting them which only further endangers their lives. And now abortion bans have even less authority because we now have drugs that women can take in the comfort of their own home to induce an abortion without having to go to a clinic/planned parenthood. Those drugs were literally created by combining currently existing over the counter medication, so even if abortion pills are banned women can simply buy the drugs used to create the abortion drug cocktail and still yield the same result.  Does that mean it shouldn’t matter if abortion bans exist cause women can get them anyway? No. Abortion bans are stupid because they needlessly attempt to put the government in control of a woman’s uterus when it is literally *impossible* to end the practice of abortion in the 1st place. Not to mention the fact 66% of Americans support abortions through the 1st trimester, and the overwhelming majority of abortions happen within the 1st trimester. Abortion rights are currently the most popular that they’ve ever been since Roe had been codified and support is only increasing as you go down into the younger generations. The anti-choice crowd is fighting a losing battle, in 10, 20+ years support for abortion’s going to be even bigger than it is now. Its a generational shift that you can’t change at this point.  If anti-choice people really cared about ending abortion they would wake up and acknowledge it is impossible to use the state to regulate women’s bodies. The only solution is to simply *reduce* them, which again bans don’t even have the ability to do that. What has been proven to reduce abortions is by increasing funding in comprehensive sex education, allow women free access to contraception, and funding for government resources to support women financially and emotionally who are considering having an abortion, etc. And guess what? The anti-choice people don’t support any of those 3 things. So until they get over themselves and accept that the practice of abortion will never end, women will continue having abortions despite all these bans and we will keep fighting to get rid of these bans.']

You claimed the popular vote would be bad because candidates would focus on the few states that would control the outcome. But as I explained: 1) there\'s no reason to think this would be true with a popular vote; and 2) it\'s actually *already* true with the Electoral College. So, u/-HypocrisyFighter-, do you see your own hypocrisy on this? If you actually believe what you\'re saying, then you shouldn\'t support the Electoral College.   As for this new argument, it\'s basically circular. We\'re a constitutional republic, and a constitutional republic needs to have this convoluted electoral college system, so therefore we need the electoral college. Right? But in addition to being a circular argument, that\'s not even true about constitutional republics. A republic is essentially just a kind of representative democracy. So a ""constitutional republic"" is just a representative democracy that\'s bound by a constitution. So why exactly couldn\'t we have a representative democracy where everyone gets an equal vote for president? What is inconsistent about that? It\'s actually pretty simple. France, for example, is a constitutional republic with a president who is elected in a popular vote.   And again, it\'s worth remembering the original purpose of the Electoral College. It has nothing to do with any of the arguments you\'ve made here. The point was that the Founders didn\'t trust people to vote for president. They thought people would be too dumb and ill-informed. So instead, each state would send a few local political elites to join this temporary political body that would then choose the president. Of course, we\'ve essentially abandoned that system -- and for good reason! Each state lets people vote for president, and it\'s mostly irrelevant that they\'re technically just voting for a slate of electors that then picks the president. The electors don\'t really get to exercise any independent judgment. But then that eliminates the entire original purpose of the Electoral College. We end up with this system that usually (but not always) reflects the will of the voters.   Since we don\'t even have the system the Founders originally intended, why not just replace the Electoral College with an actual popular vote? That way the candidate with fewer votes doesn\'t weirdly become president some of the time.', 'How would a popular vote for president instead of an electoral vote make any of this happen?']"

Women are simply not being demonized 24/7 by men, least of all by the media, academia, entertainment &amp; education or politics. That objectively does not happen whatsoever. There has literally been research on this (admittedly, I don\'t remember the exact source). But it showed that ""men"" as a group are talked about in a negative light the majority of the time in the media. No such bias exists against women.  Don\'t tell me you know what it feels like to open the internet &amp; see a dozen ""kill all women"" posts. Don\'t tell me you know what it feels like to watch TV &amp; hear something along the lines of ""women are trash"". Don\'t tell me you know what it\'s like to listen to the radio and for some guest to appear and talk about how privileged women are and how they are responsible for all of human suffering. Women are NOT demonized en masse. Sorry.        “How do they perceive me?” “Do they think I’m not capable?” “If I mess up they’ll think it’s because I’m a woman.”  What are you even talking about??? I don\'t know any man who genuinely believes this.        ""I suffer with anxiety""  Evidently. Precisely why I told you to delete all social media.  ""It affects the way I play video games. I waited until I was 18 to change my gamertag so people wouldn’t shit on me for being a woman when I die""  I\'m sorry but if this is the extent of your ""oppression"" in life, I can\'t take that seriously &amp; all you proved is how privileged you truly are. If you can\'t handle generic video game trash-talk, then mute the chat or don\'t use a mic. 99% of online gamers don\'t use a mic. Those times have passed. You were literally 5 years old when the peak of trash-talking happened (CoD MW2). And that was overwhelmingly (young) guys shitting on other guys.  ""Sounds dumb, but it’s genuinely a thing""  It IS dumb and I couldn\'t care less even if it was a ""thing"". Literally no one is going to ""shit on you"" in an online game if you die. No one has the time to look at your gamertag and follow the leaderbord during a game. That\'s just silly. They might harass you if you talk with the mic, but again, if that bothers you, don\'t use the mic.        ""You probably don’t take it all too seriously because I’m young, but these problems are just as valid to me as they would be to someone in their mid 30’s""  I was circumcized as a young boy because men don\'t have genital integrity rights anywhere in the world. That\'s a REAL fucking issue. You\'re goddamn right I don\'t take you seriously if you\'re going to whine about something so petty as ""potential online harassment"". Btw, Pew Research shows that men face more online abuse anyway. It\'s not a ""female"" issue.        ""Yes, I don’t have all the answers to the original concept of feminism. No one really does""  No one? It\'s not hard to educate yourself on its history.  ""But I can assure that when women wanted jobs, to go to school, to vote, it wasn’t their intention for those horrible things to happen to men""  Wtf are you even talking about? Women have ALWAYS WORKED. This is what I mean when I say your generation has been brainwashed by feminism. Women have always went to schools. There are records of female voters dating back 400 years. You could say there were barriers, but feminism has deliberately ignored the reasons as to WHY those barriers existed in the first place. Fundamentally, it had absolutely nothing to do with ""oppressing women"". Also, all men got the vote a meager TEN years before the suffragettes got the vote. And this is interpreted by feminists as men ""always having all the rights for thousands of years"". This is SUCH a joke.  And it\'s not true to say it ""wasn\'t their intention"". It was EXPLICITLY their intention, as they were more than happy to enforce &amp; perpetuate it.        ""If all that was normalized then, I think women would’ve been drafted""  Bullshit. Anyone in any relevant position who\'s pushed for women\'s inclusion in the draft has always been immediately blocked, to this very day.  ""But it wasn’t normalized, hence why women had no part in it. Nowadays we see women participating in going to war because their opportunities have grown.""  For fuck\'s sake... there is a very big difference between being ""allowed"" to go to war, and being FORCED to. I don\'t give a shit if a very minute % of women ""want to fight"". What I care about is that MILLIONS OF MEN were FORCED to. If war breaks out in Europe with all the fuckery going on right now, I will be drafted &amp; there\'s nothing I can do about it.        ""It’s not about equality at this point, it’s equity. Both genders have different needs that need be met in different ways.""  Right.... can you even name me one legitimate female issue? I\'ve asked several women this question and NOT ONE has been able to give me an answer that wasn\'t complete bullshit.', 'And here I thought feminism was about gender equality.']"

Being a direct descendant of the English colonies American law is based off of the English model. Our earliest documents from the Mayflower compact to the Constitution itself share a lineage with the Magna Carta. Even the American Bill of Rights being modeled after the English Bill of Rights.  The individual right, unconnected to milita service, pre-exists the United States and the Constitution. This right is firmly based in English law.  In 1689 The British Bill of Rights gave all protestants the right to keep and bear arms.  ""The English right was a right of individuals, not conditioned on militia service...The English right to arms emerged in 1689, and in the century thereafter courts, Blackstone, and other authorities recognized it. They recognized a personal, individual right."" - CATO Brief on DC v Heller  Prior to the debates on the US Constitution or its ratification multiple states built the individual right to keep and bear arms, unconnected to militia service, in their own state constitutions.  ""That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the State"" - chapter 1, Section XV, Constitution of Vermont - July 8, 1777.  ""That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state"" - A DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OR STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, Section XIII, Constitution of Pennsylvania - September 28, 1776.  Later the debates that would literally become the American Bill of Rights also include the right of the people to keep and bear arms.  ""And that the said Constitution never be constructed to authorize Congress to infringe on the just liberty of the press, or the rights of the conscience; or prevent of people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms; or to raise standing armies, unless when necessary for the defense of the United States, or of some one or more of them; or to prevent the people from petitioning, in a peaceful and orderly manner, the federal legislature for a redress of grievances; or to subject the people to unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons, papers, or possessions."" - Debates and proceedings in the Convention of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, 1788. Page 86-87.  The American Bill of Rights itself was a compromise between the federalist and anti-federalist created for the express purpose of protecting individual rights.  ""In the ratification debate, Anti-Federalists opposed to the Constitution, complained that the new system threatened liberties, and suggested that if the delegates had truly cared about protecting individual rights, they would have included provisions that accomplished that.\xa0 With ratification in serious doubt, Federalists announced a willingness to take up the matter of\xa0 a series of amendments, to be called the Bill of Rights, soon after ratification and the First Congress\xa0 comes into session.\xa0 The concession was\xa0 undoubtedly\xa0 necessary to secure the Constitution\'s hard-fought ratification.\xa0 Thomas Jefferson, who did not attend the Constitutional Convention, in a December 1787 letter to Madison called the omission of a Bill of Rights a major mistake: ""A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth.""  In Madison\'s own words:  “I think we should obtain the confidence of our fellow citizens, in proportion as we fortify the rights of the people against the encroachments of the government,” Madison said in his address to Congress in June 1789.  Madison\'s first draft of the second Amendment is even more clear.  ""The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.""  Ironically it was changed because the founders feared someone would try to misconstrue a clause to deny the right of the people.  ""Mr. Gerry -- This declaration of rights, I take it, is intended to secure the people against the maladministration of the Government; if we could suppose that, in all cases, the rights of the people would be attended to, the occasion for guards of this kind would be removed. Now, I am apprehensive that this clause would give an opportunity to the people in power to destroy the Constitution itself. They can declare who are those religiously scrupulous and prevent them from bearing arms."" - House of Representatives, Amendments to the Constitution 17, Aug. 1789  Please note Mr. Gerry clearly refers to this as the right of the people.  This is also why we have the 9th Amendment.  ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.""  Article I Section 8 had already established and addressed the militia and the military making the incorrect collective militia misinterpretation redundant.  Supreme Court cases like US v. Cruikshank, Presser v. Illinois, Nunn v State, DC v. Heller, and even the Dredd Scott decision specifically call out the individual right to keep and bear arms unconnected to militia service.  This is further evidenced by State Constitutions including the Right to keep and bear arms from the Colonial Period to Modern Day.  “The Constitutions of most of our states assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves, in all cases to which they think themselves competent, (as in electing their functionaries executive and legislative, and deciding by a jury of themselves, both fact and law, in all judiciary cases in which any fact is involved) or they may act by representatives, freely and equally chosen; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed; that they are entitled to freedom of person; freedom of religion; freedom of property; and freedom of the press. in the structure of our legislatures we think experience has proved the benefit of subjecting questions to two separate bodies of deliberants; ...” - Thomas Jefferson’s letter to John Cartwright, on June 5th, 1824', 'But it have gun?']"

Indistinguishable from my duty pistol. The only difference was the barrel. Once I removed the magazine and and made sure there was nothing in the chamber (first clue it was an airsoft gun), I looked at the barrel. It was literally the only way to tell it wasn’t real.', ""I can only assume a company as large as Sig decided the market wasn't there for it.  16 inches makes sense for competitive shooters and people who don't want a pistol/SBR.  For short barrels, 8 inches doesn't offer much ballistically over 4.5 inches.  I was happy with the size of my 8 inch AR-9 until I ordered a can, even with a short suppressor it would be almost as long as an unsuppressed 16 inch gun.  I thought about shortening the AR but didn't want to put more money into a $600 PSA gun.  So I waited and jumped on the Stribog when I found a good deal.  I'm happy with the length, although rail space has been an issue.  The biggest challenge was finding an AFG that would fit.  I reached out to A3Tactical to see if they had something that would work and they ended up making a prototype for me.  They were going to start producing them but they put several projects on hold due to the proposed pistol brace ban.  Although if there's enough interest they might make a limited run, so here's hoping."", 'I should have elaborated further in my initial comment.   When you train to utilize a firearm for defensive uses you should always be training with your primary firearm as characteristics change from gun to gun. Let’s do a comparison to really nail down those differences. I have a tx22 which is a little plinking pistol chambered in 22lr. It’s an easy pistol to shoot with almost no felt recoil. I conceal carry a p365xl in 9mm. It’s a great gun which while easy to shoot has significantly more felt recoil and a different size, grip, and set of sights. When shooting both of these pistols I will conduct myself differently in regard to point of aim, expected impact point, grip, and shooting stance. With the tx22 I can reasonably shoot with almost any grip even utilizing poor stance and technique while expecting decent results. The same can not be said for the 9mm.   If you utilized the 22 only for training this would lead to poor habits in technique that are masked by the low recoil and ease of use. Then when you transition to a firearm that you do not shoot often because of your training crutch you are going to experience far more misses and potential issues like losing control of your firearm. I have seen folks transition to larger calibers that expect the same results and let the recoil wildly throw the firearm around. If you do that in a defensive situation where you are going to fire multiple shots in succession you are going to let rounds fly that you have no idea where they are going to impact. These rounds may end up in your neighbors or loved ones. If you aren’t using 22 defensively then you should leave firearms like that to plinking or casual shooting only.  The correct procedure for the OP should be to visit a gun range with an instructor and rent several firearms to determine which size, weight, and configuration they are comfortable with then take some classes to develop the correct technique and increase confidence behind the trigger. Then to continue to drill and train on their own while periodically taking further education on practical shooting. Ideally taking part in events such as IDPA or USPSA so they can understand dynamic shooting as opposed to static shooting in a controlled environment. Having a firearm should not be a light decision where you buy a plinking pistol and shoot it once in a while and consider yourself proficient enough for a defensive situation where you have shot your primary firearm little to none. We have a responsibility to those around us as well as our loved ones so we shouldn’t allow poor training or concepts to potentially make the situation worse.']"

My last update was:  - ""I still think drag shows targeting children are innapropriate"". This is still my view, with the exception of:  - ""If a drag show existed in an environment that was not sexual and had all sexual content removed, then that would be appropriate"" This acknowledges that drag shows can exist that are not sexual, which I noted because that was part of my changed view.  - ""However examples I have seen online don\'t support this"" In the numerous examples I provided, the drag shows didn\'t remove the adult content to be child friendly. They have the same adult content as per usual. You and I disagree on what constitutes adult content, but I addressed this in a previous comment. So although drag shows can exist that have been censored and made suitable for children, this is not the case, the examples I\'ve posted refute this.  - On the topic of drag and drag shows not being inherently or commonly sexual, there is evidence that sexual undertones are a pervasive and key element of drag:  The below are extracts from two articles that are PRO drag, describing drag without an an anti-drag agenda.

""Audience members join the performance by miming sex acts""  ""Their bawdy talk about sex acts shocks the audience""  ""By listening to and having to respond to vulgar talk about body parts and sex acts, and by being fondled and stripped in a public space...""

""Certain types of interactions usually considered taboo would not be restricted within club walls.""

I agree that the rich profit from inflation by buying assets which appreciate.  But they'd profit from deflation by sitting on cash reserves.  Either way they're going to profit because they are rich and money makes money; the only difference is that inflation at least incentivizes them to stimulate the economy by buying and selling assets.  As for inflation increasing rent, it also increases wages, and should do so at about the same rate.  I do agree that there is turbulence created because these things don't happen to individual people in lock-step, which *is* a cost.  On the other hand, one of the assets that inflation encourages the rich to invest in is building new rental properties, which lowers prices by increasing supply.  I don't actually know whether inflation or deflation would be better for poor renters if these were ht only two factors on the scales; in reality I think deflation just tanks the entire economy fast enough to overwhelm those effects either way.  As far as the middle class with a small amount of discretionary wealth goes, it's basically the same as the wealthy. The smart ones will either buy assets (mostly homes or index funds) and have them appreciate under inflation, or sit on savings under deflation.  And the dumb ones will do the opposite of that and suffer, under either situation.    At least under inflation, it is smart to buy a house and other appreciating assets, so you get to enjoy having them while they appreciate instead of not having them while the money sits in a bank account.  I think that basic difference, getting to buy things that you enjoy the use of while they appreciate, makes inflation better for the middle class with a little bit of discretionary wealth."", ""Who is worried about inflation?

I make one apple and someone pays me 1 dollar, next year I make 2 apples but with no inflation I am forced to sell both apples for 1 dollar, and like that I am no longer able to make money in the economy, because the money supply doesn't grow with the goods.

On-campus dorms could house fewer than 4,000 students out of a total student body of more than 30,000. Most facilities were badly outdated, and the average student paid $12,800 a year (in 2016 dollars) in tuition to attend.  Today, Temple, where I work, looks very different. Beautiful new buildings are the norm rather than the exception. A recently built 24-story dorm and adjoining dining center highlights the university’s transition to a residential campus. Each of the dorm’s apartment-style suites comes equipped with a flat-screen TV and other amenities. The number of administrators in management and executive positions has grown by 40 percent to over 900. Oh, and tuition now runs $19,000 for the typical student after accounting for scholarships and other aid.  It’s tempting to blame Temple’s shiny buildings and new administrators for the big increase in tuition. But there’s another, much more important reason for the rising costs: Over the same period, Pennsylvania’s state government cut its per-student appropriations by $6,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars.  The rapid increase in the cost of college in recent decades — and the associated explosion in student debt, which now totals nearly $1.3 trillion nationally — is all too familiar to many Americans. But few understand what has caused the tuition boom, particularly at the public institutions that enroll roughly two-thirds of all students at four-year colleges. Many commenters,\xa0particularly\xa0in the\xa0popular press, focus on ballooning administrative budgets and extravagant student amenities. Those elements have played a role, to be sure, but by far the single biggest driver of rising tuitions for public colleges has been declining state funding for higher education.  It is true that today’s students enjoy better amenities — usually in the form of nicer gyms, dorms and dining halls, though some campuses feature\xa0lazy rivers and climbing walls\xa0— than I or, especially, my parents did during our time in college. It is also true that today’s universities employ far more administrators and staff who don’t have any direct role in either research or instruction. When my father attended the University of Florida1\xa0in the 1970s, professors were required to also serve as academic advisors and meet individually with students to plan their schedules. Today, schools retain many staffers whose role is to assist both faculty and students. Some of those jobs are easy to mock: One\xa0frustrated grad student\xa0built a\xa0job-title generator\xa0that spits out bloated titles such as vice executive for the committee on dining relations.  Recent Stories from FiveThirtyEight  ￼Top Storiesby\xa0FiveThirtyEight00:3701:12￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼33 Cool Charts We MadeIn 2022  And it is also true that professors (at least those on the tenure track) are paid better than the people who held those same jobs years ago. Average salaries for full professors (the highest rank) at\xa0top public institutions exceed\xa0$160,000 annually. Salaries for full professors have risen 12 percent in excess of inflation since 2000.  All of those trends add to the cost of college, but not by that much. At most, about a quarter of the increase in college tuition since 2000 can be attributed to rising faculty salaries, improved amenities and administrative bloat. By comparison, the decline in state support accounts for about three-quarters of the rising cost of college.  Consider Pennsylvania’s four public research institutions,2\xa0one of which is Temple.3\xa0Average tuition revenue per student (adjusted for inflation) increased by $5,880 between the 2000-01 and 2013-14 academic years (the most recent available data). State appropriations per student have declined nearly $4,000 over the same period, from about $7,750 to $3,900. Put another way, if Pennsylvania restored funding for higher education to its 2000 levels, Pennsylvania’s public research institutions could reduce tuition by nearly $4,000 per year without altering their budgets. For students, the impact could be even greater once loan fees and interest were taken into account.  By contrast, imagine that each of these institutions cut per-student spending for student services, administration and instruction back to 2000 levels, then passed those savings on to students in the form of lower tuition. How much would students save? Reducing student services would save each student $380 per year. Dropping all those new administrators would save $150 per student per year. And rolling back spending on faculty salaries would save $850 per year for the average student. Together, those three categories have added $1,380 to the cost of attendance since 2000, about a quarter of the total increase. At least some of that spending benefits students directly: Student-service spending has been found to increase the\xa0likelihood of graduating, and increased spending on instruction leads to\xa0higher earnings\xa0later in life.  National trends for all public four-year schools mirror those from the research institutions of Pennsylvania, although there are sizable differences across states, as the table below shows. In the median state, South Carolina, the decline in state appropriations explains 81 percent of the increase in tuition revenue. Only three states — Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming — have kept funding for higher education on pace with inflation and enrollment growth (represented by negative numbers in the table). In 17 states, the price of college would have actually\xa0declined\xa0since 2000 (states with a share greater than 100 percent in the table) if funding had been kept constant and the schools applied that money entirely to students’ tuition bills. While state funding has rebounded somewhat during the economic recovery following the Great Recession, most states’ increases have not kept pace with enrollment growth.']

Come on…', 'It’s a compounding issue that’s caused by a multitude of factors z   The first hurdle is that families in those areas don’t really care about school much. So their kids fuck around and don’t pay attention in class. When teachers try and stop it, the parents get angry and threaten to bring the school to court over the handling over their kid, so the school just backs down and lets the trouble makers continue ruining the classroom. A teacher can only do so much when kids are doing drugs, beating each other up, and generally causing mayhem. But these kids are protected by the school board, so there’s nothing that can be done.   The second hurdle is connected to the first, school boards. These school boards are usually comprised first and foremost of grifters. They don’t care about the functionality of the school, they just want town, state, and governments to keep shoveling money into the school system. If the school system improves, then the easy money goes away. When these schools get their increased budgets, it goes directly into the pockets of admins.   The third hurdle is that teachers don’t want to teach at bad schools. The worst schools need the best teachers to offset the disadvantage the kids are at. But why would a good teacher waste their time working for a bad school? It’s dangerous for one. They also have very little power over the classroom. These bad schools also tend to be located in cities, so cost of living is a problem for them as well. The good teachers dip out after they realize they can’t save the school, leaving only the shitty teachers.   The end result of all of this is that the bad schools remain in a perpetual cycle of failure.']

Maybe you don't realize that's why, but your solution is worse by pretty much every single metric than just making DC a state. You just don't want them to have senators.  Giving federal districts equal representation isn't even a new concept. Brazil, Mexico,and Argentina all give their federal districts representation in both houses of their Congress as if they were states, and Australia's Capital Territory has equal representation in the House and lesser representation in the Senate.""]"

Here are your opinions and facts:  Opinion: “Liberal” media “Slander” of Rittenhouse.  Fact: Rittenhouse killed perfect strangers.  Fact: Rittenhouse was cleared of charges.  Here is my opinion: Rittenhouse killed those people because he drank the coolaide of Republican propaganda. Had Rittenhouse stayed home those people would still be alive.  Our forefathers worked hard to create a society free of vigilante justice. Rittenhouse and the Republicans are intent on breaking the social contracts that hold our otherwise peaceful country together.', 'Castle doctrine doesn\'t have anything to do with the case, normal self defense does. He was asked by his friend to come help protect the store and the store owner asked his friend to come and bring people. So yes, he was asked to go, but thats irrelevant anyways. He had a right to be there like anyone else.    You\'re being downvoted because Rittenhouse was clearly *not* a vigilante. He was there doing good things for the community and didn\'t let himself be killed. What\'s truly weird about the Rittenhouse story is how so many blame Rittenhouse when he literally did nothing wrong. Everything he did was the by the books way he was suppose to do things. He administrated first aid, put out fires, etc. When attacked by a crazy rioter (who had threatened Rittenhouse earlier) Rittenhouse *didnt shoot*. Instead of shooting at the time he was attacked, which completely destroys the ""vigilante"" theory, Rittenhouse retreated. He *ran away* from the conflict, disengaging as much as he could. Only when he had no choice did he shoot', "" And this is where the argument has gone full on, pants on head *stupid*.   I honestly can't fathom how far one has to insert their head into their rectal orifice to think this is an intelligent or compelling argument.   We as Americans have the right to walk our streets without fear of assault from violent criminals. Where those violent criminals choose to break that social contract, we have the right to dispatch the threat with force, up to and including lethal force. Kyle Rittenhouse was walking the street attempting to put out a vehicle fire when he became the victim of a violent, unprovoked attack by Joseph Rosenbaum. There is no reason Rittenhouse should have or could have known that that simple action would subject him to a violent, unlawful assault.   Joseph Rosenbaum knew or should have known that his violent, unprovoked assault on an openly armed person would lead to serious injury or death for himself. That knowledge did not dissuade him, and he paid for his stupidity with his life.   Maybe we should blame *him*, not the kid who he attacked.    What I don't understand is how your side is shamelessly inconsistent and hypocritical in your arguments.   You blame Rittenhouse for the events of that night simply because he was there trying to protect his community from bad faith actors who were trying to destroy it, yet the violent career criminal who attacked Rittenhouse is spared from fault. In some circles, Rosenbaum is considered a hero. You denigrate Rittenhouse by pointing out that he traveled from outside of the area to be there and did so while armed, yet you hail Gaige Grosskreutz when he traveled further than Rittenhouse did, with no ties to the community, and unlike Rittenhouse he did so while *illegally* armed because his concealed weapons permit had been revoked after his felony conviction.   Frankly, I'd have a lot more respect for you guys if you dropped these nonsensical arguments and just admitted that you wanted to fry Rittenhouse because you hated what he stood for and killed people you consider allies with a weapon you despise. At least then I could give consideration for the honesty.    No, I don't have any regard for the lives of a repeated violent child rapist and a serial domestic abuser who attacked a 17 year old child without provocation. The world is objectively a better place now that Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber are no longer alive.""]"

I think too many people decide to try going vegan by just buying the beyond/impossible/gardein stuff and think that veganism is absurdly expensive, and honestly, if that's what you're eating for every meal, it's neither affordable nor healthy. It's funny though, because my grocery bill was almost cut in half when I went vegan."", 'Was gonna say, there still has to be some “animal” component to this meat otherwise it’s not, well, meat. Even in a lab, they’re still going to require animal cells to grow this meat, which obviously by definition makes it not vegan and doesn’t necessarily negate the whole ethical issue surrounding meat consumption. I have to wonder if this would just change the way and reasons we farm cows specifically, because if their genetic material is required to make lab grown meats then the need for cattle for the meat industry is still present.']"

You have it all figured out. Therapy doesn’t work because you say it doesn’t work. People who need or benefit from therapy don’t need or benefit from therapy. Why? Because “I’m right”.   A healthy person can’t go to therapy and get benefit from it regularly. Why? Because “I’m right”  The same way someone gets benefit from a personal trainer, that can’t happen with a therapist. Why? Because “I’m right”.   You’ve convinced yourself your opinion is fact. That’s why your response to direct examples is either deny their existence or say they’re wrong. Why? Because “I’m right”.   You’ve made no argument beyond “I’m right”. There’s no nuance to your view. There’s no argument as to why it doesn’t work beyond “it doesn’t work because I say so”.   Therapy can’t be for stability and improvement. Why? Because “I’m right”.   In your mind, therapy is only “you need fixing and when you’re fixed, you’re done”. So someone going to therapy for any other reason is invalid. Why? Because “I’m right”.   Absolutely none of your arguments or comments go beyond “I’m right” why are you right?

You can have a healthy relationship with a therapist the same way you can a personal trainer. It can have a dependence. But that’s not a requirement of therapy.   That’s like me arguing going to a personal trainer makes you less physically fit. There’s no logic there. And there’s no logic in you saying a therapist makes you less mentally fit.   I’m telling you why some people go to therapy. Your argument is “I’m right and you’re wrong” and “I know what’s best” and “I know what’s best for these people”.   Again, the argument of this post is that therapy is bad for you. I have specific examples where people benefit from regular therapy. This isn’t to say it’s for everyone or that everyone would benefit from regular therapy. Same goes for physical fitness.   Some people don’t want or need a personal trainer to be physically fit. Some people do. And going to one helps you in objective ways. The same is true for therapy. Not everyone wants or needs therapy to be mentally fit. Not everyone wants or needs regular therapy. Some people choose to because it helps them.   Your argument of “no. These people who say they benefit from this are wrong. I’m right” isn’t an argument. That’s you plugging your ears and going “lalalalalala” to preserve your own opinion, when presented with evidence that contradicts your view.   You’re working backward from “I’m right and nothing will change my mind”. That’s why you deny the existence of the specific group of people I mentioned who choose to go to regular therapy to maximize their mental fitness.   I’m working from “therapy helps these people stay mentally fit”. You’re choosing to listen to yourself over others while saying others are saying “I’m right and I know what’s best”. Your argument is pure projection.   You’re making a blanket statement that regular therapy doesn’t and can’t work. All I have to do is give one example of it working for someone and benefiting them to prove you wrong. Which I’ve done. You refusing to acknowledge that reality isn’t an argument. And you saying “nope. They don’t exist/they’d be better off without therapy/therapy is bad for them” isn’t an argument.   I’m not making a blanket statement. I’m saying regular therapy can help people. To prove me wrong, you need to prove that regular therapy in all cases is bad and never works. You haven’t done that. You’ve simply repeatedly said “I’m right. Therapy is bad”.  And then you pretend all therapy is fixing someone, when that’s not why all people go to therapy. Some go to stay mentally fit, not to get better. Your refusal to a acknowledge this group of people and respond is a forfeiting response.   I give examples of refusal therapy helping people and you respond with examples of how it could be bad, which is irrelevant to the examples I gave and my argument still stands.   You need to provide evidence that therapy doesn’t work. Saying “therapy doesn’t work. I know what’s best” isn’t an argument. No matter how much you want it to be. Lol']

The actual largest party in Quebec, the [Coalition Avenir Québec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Avenir_Qu%C3%A9bec), opposes the [independent movement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/quebec-election-results-caq-victory-francois-legault), and has passed laws such as [Bill 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_respecting_the_laicity_of_the_State), which prohibits certain public employees from wearing religious symbols and [Bill 96](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_French_Language#2021_amendment_(Bill_96)), which added clauses to the Canadian Constitution that stated that Quebec is a nation and that its language is French, forcing all commercial signage from non-French trademarks to include a ""predominant"" of French on all signs, applying the *Charter of the French Language* to businesses with 25-49 employees and federal workspaces, as well as other policy changes reflecting the expansion of government power to protect French. While there was [much](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/nenshi-opposition-quebec-bill-21-1.5305955) [criticism](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/ndp-leader-would-back-federal-intervention-in-court-challenge-to-quebec-s-bill-21-1.5706833) towards these acts, both [within](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/english-montreal-school-board-legal-fight-bill-21-secularism-religious-symbols-ban-1.5298586) and [outside](https://archive.vn/q3kCB) of the [province](https://news.yahoo.com/quebec-bill-96-french-language-163113131.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAECvEqBVDS4YOjPOzb2Y1vTkJgTH0wj19_RzDNDOsIKfwTKZYn1-91Bplskd1yp_8XhbiHgK1T_A38ON1Sad8T7rL80uqwDQuZd3Te7mnPoPQnMkQh6Cjb2w5pW2yad-E92kDb5v-E6kzqmrUB2dc2ofXX6Z38lCI2ej3lIXa77F), political leadership in Canada is not interested in preventing these legislative acts from coming into effect, especially [Trudeau](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-bill-21-jurisdiction-teacher-hijab-1.6283895), who states that while he was ""deeply opposed"" to Bill 21, he would not commit with a jurisdictional battle over Quebec over it. Furthermore, nearly all of the Canadian [House of Commons](https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/bloc-quebecois-motion-acknowledging-quebecs-bill-96-passes-281-2) supported a Bloc motion to recognize Bill 96, with 2 independents voting against it, and 16, 29, 5, and 1 abstentions from Conservatives, Liberals, New Democrats, and the Green Party, with [Trudeau](https://montrealgazette.com/news/bill-96-trudeau-concerned-about-decline-of-french-but-still-opposes-law) stating that Quebec could unilaterally amend the Constitution.  Now, why is CAQ doing this? You may argue that it is because of separatism, but I see the rise of CAQ as a part of the mid-2010\'s nationalist and anti-immigrant movements across Europe and North America. This can be seen in CAQ reducing the number of immigrant acceptances from 53,000 to 40,000 in [2019](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-quebec-announces-reduced-immigration-targets-fuelling-tensions-with/), and [calling](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-immigration-legault-paris-1.4987843) for more immigration from France and Europe generally. Overall, Quebec in recent years has been governed by a non-separatist, but nationalist party that gained several concessions from an accommodate federal government.   You don\'t ""presume"" in an argument. You are the one to provide the evidence in the argument, not the other side. You still committed a fallacy.   You clearly did not read the webpage, because it states that in order to use an authority in an argument, the authority must be an ""expert in the area of knowledge under consideration,"" its statement must be under ""concerns his or her area of mastery,"" and if there is ""agreement among experts in the area of knowledge under consideration."" Even if all of these conditions were made ""that does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion."" While your original statement used Supreme Court justices, and their legal decisions, it is clear that there isn\'t much agreement among legal experts on whether Cakeshop case was decided correctly. Additionally, as you failed to incorporate their evidence in your claims, instead using what they claimed as evidence for your argument, which makes things much weaker.   There was a need because the Supreme Court had established a conflicting precedent as constitutional against the mainstream interpretation. Therefore, in order to clarify the ambiguity of the document, and to maintain the mainstream view, Congress and the states agreed to adopt the 11th Amendment.   Fair enough. I should have said, [""aren\'t these two experts and therefore should be given the same level of ""expertise"" as Supreme Court justices?](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/v0chmf/proposed_map_of_the_us_gerrymandered_so_that_the/iz9hidm/), rather than ""truthfulness."" However, even then different legal theories and ideologies can formulate different formal legal truths, even from the same set of legal facts.   If selective enforcement creates equity between groups, then I wouldn\'t oppose it. Current US abortion policy is creating disparity between groups, so I oppose it.', ' People think about Canada?', ' Admitted it...  You know a lot of separatists always claim that the English media is biased towards a certain viewpoint. Why shouldn\'t I say the same thing in there? This is outright goddamn electoral denial. Yes lost, twice, so now you need to make up stuff to justify that.  You want to go at it a third round? Let\'s do it. Then after Yes loses again, we\'ll be seeing the temper tantrums again about how people cheated.  One article about some obscure man nobody knows about means absolutely nothing. Maybe go and find how Chretien cheated or something. At the very least my claims come from what that clown Parizeau said.   No scandals? Dude, there were scandals. Don\'t try to make it like there weren\'t. It\'s not a cultural difference, and the French media not covering it really doesn\'t mean anything.   Dude he went into the middle of a live debate to coax the other guy into saying the n-word in front of a black woman. You can make your case for GND,  frankly, I think he\'s a fucking idiot for not saying more, but he\'s also responsible, and we all know why he didn\'t denounce that shit, because in the separatist movement this sort of trash is tolerated and had he said otherwise those people would have pounced on his ass.   No he just went on TV to bait the other separatist leader, because he was throwing red meat to his base, and trying to kneecap GND. I mean, I don\'t know what you\'re defending here, but that dude went straight for that shit on purpose. Like how much more fucking racist can you get than going on a live debate and uttering the n-word, coercing someone else into saying it and then saying it in front of a black woman. There are literally no excuses for that, none whatsoever.  Not even Legault or Duhaime pulled shit like that, and from them you could expect that. Nah, it was the PQ and QS who played that shit on live tv.   I know about that, and I believe it was a terrible thing that was done to them. The reality, however, is that I Quebec today is Canada\'s second-highest GDP. More than that, Quebec gets a lot of special privileges in Canada, most of which I am in agreement with. I have no issue with that, and I have no issue with the province. I chose it, I learned the language, and I would never ever trade that experience for anything.  But I have links to Canada, strong links to it in Toronto and elsewhere in Ontario. I\'m not going to go against that, because I feel strongly attached to Canada as well.   Quebec did not have the same struggles as people of color, and whatever happened there is not comparable. Besides that, what is it that Quebec doesn\'t have today in Canada that is comparable to how people of color in the USA? Like I said, Quebec is the second-biggest GDP in Canada. Quebec has considerable power in anything that the federal government does, most politicians in this country come here to get votes because they cannot win without Quebec. Quebec is literally essential to Canada.  What exactly would be necessary to make enough amends for what was done in the past?   Deny what? Quebec has been given two referendums, and if they wanted a third they would get it. You\'re being denied nothing. Yes lost twice. Maybe you should stop denying that, and maybe you should stop denying that the other Québécois have made their choice to stay in Canada.   Because I already know where this goes. You\'re trying to guilt-trip me by saying things like ""why would you deny Quebec this or that?"" when that is not true at all. I know what comes next, and I know what you\'re going to say, because every time this conversation comes up and separatists find that someone does not agree with them, they resort to cheap tactics. It\'s all over the movement, and that shit with the n-word was exactly that as well.   A moderator from arr Quebec did it once, blocked me because I asked him to produce evidence of how Parizeau was denounced, he couldn\'t, so he blocked me. Others went around calling me a colonizer, a Russian partisan, or denying that I am Latino and calling me an anglophone instead. You want me to see your side? Then start to acknowledge the problems of yours. There\'s a debt to pay in there, and you can blame your fellow separatists for that.   I didn\'t do anything to them. I learned the language, I integrated, and I chose to move here instead of every other place in Canada. I\'m not sure what more can be asked of me. I\'m not some fucking bum coming to Quebec to demand special privileges or ask that I be spoken to in English. But I will also not let people talk me down and tell me shit, because I don\'t agree with their viewpoints. If their cause is so weak that they have no good arguments to convince me then that is their fault.']"

For example, the community agreed the world was flat at one point and people were persecuted for saying the opposite even though they were right.  Also, your own argument in a way proves my point. You say that morals are different based on time, culture, community, etc. That’s because morality is subjective. However, a lot of communities have practiced things that are inconsistent with their own morals, so just by their own logic, they can’t be called moral. For example, slavery: white people were forcing black people to do work for them and things they didn’t want to do. Those same white people would not like it or consider it moral if the same were done to them.

(This was in response to the morality of eating cows) I would argue that the reason is pretty good: don’t kill the animals that give milk to you. Now you might disagree with me. Hence why morality is subjective.   What you’re proposing is not an objective definition of what’s moral but rather a logical definition of how to *enforce* morality, which I already talked about in a previous comment. Referring to your example: If I decide that I can kill someone to prevent them from suffering later in life, then they can do the same to me before I get to them. If I decide to force my morals on others, they can force their morals on me and effectively cancel out whatever I do with my morals. So logically speaking, you have to let everyone practice their own morals without inflicting it on others. But that doesn’t mean that morality itself has an objective definition. Going back to the cow example, I’ve decided that it’s immoral to eat cows and I have a reason to back that up. As long as I don’t force it others and they don’t force their morals on me, we’re all good.', 'The definition of what’s moral itself is always subjective   However, the only logical aspect of morality are that you can’t force your own morals on others and that you have to be consistent in your morals. And the reason why I say that is that if you force your morals on others, they can do the same by your own standards, and that would be paradoxical. For example, if I force you to give me your shirt on the basis that it’s moral for me to do so, then you can just force me to give it back by my own morals, and we would be back where we were.  So maintaining moral consistency and respecting individual boundaries in morality are the only logical aspects of morality. The actual definition of what is or isn’t moral is entirely subjective. I can say that wearing a red shirt is immoral, and that would just be my own subjective definition of morality.']
165	235	165_military_conscription_enlisted_marines	['military', 'conscription', 'enlisted', 'marines', 'gi', 'veterans', 'industrial', 'recruitment', 'service', 'guard']	[' Again, thank you for telling me about the cultural context of the organization I’ve been inextricably a part of for 7 years person who’s not even from this fucking country. That is literally what happened you fucking dope. 10% of the American military sees active combat: the majority of the American military, including the Marines, are non-physical administrative and support roles. *Material* changes to those gender and sexual orientation restrictions were implemented to increase the potential recruitment pool without significantly increasing compensation and pay, the PR therein was just a secondary benefit. Just like it is in any other industry that wants to expand its labor pool. *Appearing* to be inclusive is the goal behind actually getting more numbers in the board.  Physical fitness standards have been loosening in the military for years. Is it because they don’t want to be fatphobic? No, it’s because the majority of enlisted roles are technical and they were losing out on retention and recruitment goals on those technical roles since America as a whole has gotten fatter. Now active field and combat roles have additional physical requirements.  The American military has also started to loosen its rules regarding usage of marijuana and anti-depressants for new recruits. Is it because they believe these people are heckin valid and vouch for #selfcare? No, it’s because it’s becoming more legalized and that they were loosing out on recruitment goals by precluding people who smoked. They still ban marijuana usage while active and severely limit access to psychotic medications because **ding ding ding** readiness matters most.  And yeah, please go to literally any forum with actual active duty members who were around since the changes in allowing homosexuals, and every single one of them will tell you that DADT wasn’t enforced and that homosexuals were serving openly prior to the official integration in 2011, because people in the military aren’t some monolith and they don’t actually care about that kind of shit, they just care that people do their jobs.  I literally had a drill instructor that was a flaming gay man that called everyone ratchet. 25% of my recruit division was too stupid to even notice that he was gay, and not a single person in bootcamp actually gave a fuck that he was a) because he was a good instructor and b) because we were significantly more worried about doing what we were supposed to be doing, not worrying about being indoctrinated. He only ever officially disclosed his orientation to a recruit on the last day during a relaxed Q&amp;A about Fleet life when a recruit asked if he was ever scared during DADT. He literally said to them “no one cares that you’re gay, just do your fucking job.”  Because the only thing that actually matters from the enlisted personnel is their role as a *LABOR FORCE.* The DoD has, and will continue to, shift their cultural decrees and public relations stances for the purpose of maximizing their recruitment pool and effectiveness of extraction of labor from their workforce, regardless of who is in power “in the regime.”', 'And you are still concerned that the liberal ideology of the regime is what is causing the military to hate the regime.   What about the labor extraction that the enlisted in the larmy” and the Navy, Air Force, Marines, and the National Guard, and the Coast Guard experience? Remember when I mentioned all the sexual assaults? (Side note: at no point was I saying that you didn’t care about them, I was making the point that the DoD didn’t care) Why is it they all those victims of sexual assault not part of your calculation of “loyalty.” What about the work sucking and the shitty pay? Does that factor into the military’s loyalty?  If the point was to have a ideologically loyal military regardless of strength, why wouldn’t they encourage more women and gays to join by actually preventing them from getting raped? If they wanted college educated soy boys to join more, why would they be reducing ASVAB requirements and paying only slightly more? Wouldn’t they start coming up with reasons to reject recruiting from demographically conservative places like Texas and Florida, when those states are actually recruited more per capita than any other state? Why not drop recruitment numbers and just focus on blue states?  If loyalty is the concern, why do a majority of American vets find a lot of non-ideological reasons to hate the military when they get out?', ' Oh hey, look at that, a direct quote from a General with the material justification for a progressive policy. Absolutely incredible to me that you quote that SCOTUS case without any irony despite the actual argument West Point is making about how the officer corps needs diversity in order to more effectively organize the labor of the enlisted military. Almost as if this “ideological purity” they’re striving for is a position who’s primary purpose is to maximize the effectiveness of extracting labor from the enlisted. Rather than arguing with their material claims or conclusions, you just write off the decision as being “ideologically motivated.”   Inb4 you act like I approve of West Points argument: I don’t, simply because people by and large don’t actually care about racial representation in their leadership, they just want good leaders who have similar material contexts. West Point goes wrong when they think a poor black enlisted person would be better off with rich black officer, when in reality a poor black enlisted person would have a better functional relationship with a white officer who grew up in comparable material conditions.   Yeah man, any time they do something you ideologically agree with it’s because they’re trying to trick you or play the long game despite the risk that’d supposedly have on their ideological purity a year away from an election. There’s no material explanation like recruitment and retention that better explains it.   You know enlisted branches don’t even have diversity quotas right? Even in your West Point example, that was a studied they did with regards to race balancing in context of reflecting the racial make up of the enlisted sections of the military. The service academies are legally excerpt from Affirmative Action and are statistically less diverse than non-service Universities. Again, I’ll say this till I’m blue in the face, please give me any proof that the *enlisted military* has any ideological requirements of its labor force and how those trump the effectiveness of those peoples’ labor.     That’s exactly my point! The military establishment was literally *behind* the culture and ideological context of its labor force! It was literally illegal to be gay but the culture of the labor force was able to counteract that **top down** policy because they cared more about the work getting done. Funny that when it’s a conservative ideologically position it’s “lingering” but when it’s a progressive one it’s “unanimously unpopular and ideological warfare.”    I don’t even disagree with you doofus. My point is that progressivism is only a tool in order to maximize the extraction of labor, and that progressivism will be thrown out in favor of conservatism if Capital seems if and when it’s effective to do so. But to use your homosexuality example, why is it that when something because popular enough you just don’t have to call it progressive regardless of what legal and political power is behind that idea?  Again, if you’re gonna wax poetic about culture and ideology, at least talk to real people about it for 5 fucking seconds before assuming some bullshit study that won’t even be implemented is more important than labor conditions.']

Stephen Kotkin, who has written the most recent award winning biographies on Stalin, has stipulated as much, writing:  Altogether, the regime returned about 5.7 million tons of grain back to agriculture, including 2 million tons from reserves and 3.5 million from procurements. Stalin also approved clandestine purchase of grain and livestock abroad using scarce hard currency. Just between Feb and Jul. 1933, he signed or countenanced nearly three dozen small allocations of food aid to the countryside, primarily to the North Caucasus and Ukraine, as well as the Kazakh lands....Similarly, there was no ""Ukrainian"" famine; the famine was Soviet.  Source: Kotkin, ""Stalin: Waiting for Hitler 1929-1941"", p. 128-129.  Not every terrible famine is a genocide. Millions died in the effort for fast collectivisation, to help pay for industrialisation and armament of the USSR, which was poorly carried out, in an atmosphere of heightened security threats from Japan (1931-33 conquest of Manchuria) and threats from the West (namely Romania, Poland). To add to this, compared to the bumper crump year of 1930-31, 1932-33 experienced historic drought (globally), and crop pestilence, which added immensely to the woes of collective farmers.  Stalin &amp; the Bolsheviks did not have a special animus against Ukrainians, indeed it was Stalin who promoted an separate republic for Ukraine:  Stalin: ""...a Belorussian nation exists, which has its own language, different from Russian, and that the culture of the Belorussian nation can be raised only in its own language. Such speeches were made five years ago about Ukraine, concerning the Ukrainian nation... Clearly, the Ukrainian nation exists and the development of its culture is a duty of Communists. One cannot go against history.""  Source: Stephen Kotkin, ""Stalin: Paradoxes of Power, 1878-1929"", p. 388.  Indeed Stalin\'s right-hand man during these years, Kaganovich; the head of the military and a good friend, Voroshilov; as well as his ultimate successor Kruchshev, were all Ukrainians, amongst many, many others in the Bolshevik regime.', 'Holodomor is a Famine that happened for sure.

So he doesn't count. Where's a prominent leader voted out by the people?   1939 is after 1921 and after 1934, so I dont care. Its besides the point. The Poles were able to send up to 700k troops and the French 3 million. The French leadership turned out to be cowards and lost their country as a result, quite deservingly. The USSR wasn't even necessary to counter the Germans in 1939 had the Western allies put their heart into the 1939 offensive. Fortunately they helped the USSR out a lot with lend lease and strategic bombing campaigns.  Since we're stuck on ww2 for some reason or another let me close with Phillips P. O'Brien in the Journal of Strategic Studies, East versus West in the defeat of Nazi Germany  from the evidence in the survey is that the Second World War in Europe was, economically speaking, an air war. The German war economy was geared, more than anything else, to the construction and supply of aircraft and anti-air weaponry. In the crucial year of 1943, more than 41 per cent of German munitions production was devoted to making aircraft alone.  The next closest area, at a little more than 29 per cent, was ammunition, followed by naval vessels at 8.43 per cent, weapons (from anti-aircraft guns to artillery pieces to small arms) at 8.02 per cent, motor vehicles at 4.08 per cent, and halftracks at 1.78 per cent. The production of Panzers, considered the queen of the battlefields on the Eastern Front, took up only 6.27 per cent of German war production. In other words tank production took up only three-quarters as much of German production as naval construction, and less than one-sixth as much of German production as aircraft building. The domination of aircraft production continued for the rest of the war. In 1944 the percentage of the German economy devoted to building planes rose and in July of that year, when overall German munitions production reached its peak, over 48 per cent of German war production was aircraft. A further way of measuring the importance of aircraft production within the framework of the German economy can be seen not only by measuring the value of product assigned to each combatant service, but in the allocation of the German workforce. In a speech given by Albert Speer in August 1944, the Reichminister stated that even after the enormous relative increases in tank and self-propelled gun production achieved since early 1943, aircraft production still occupied far more workers than any other single part of the German war economy.   At that time more than 2,100,000 workers were involved in aircraft production while only 1,900,000 were involved in all army production, and 500,000 were employed by the navy. The preeminence of aircraft construction in economic production should lead to a reevaluation of how exactly Germany was defeated. This can best be done by looking at 1943, a year which is often seen as the turning point of the Second World War in Europe. The year 1943 is crucial for several reasons. In 1939 and 1940 the Germans were primarily occupied fighting the West, while in 1941 and 1942 the war against Russia received the highest priority. In 1943, however, the Germans came under attack from both sides. It was the year that saw the great Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk, victories that ended the possibility of any further German strategic offensives on the Eastern Front. In the West, 1943 was when the British and Americans launched their invasions of Sicily and Italy, and began the first large-scale strategic bombing campaign against Germany. Thus, 1943 is also regularly used by those who like to minimise the West's contribution to the defeat of Germany. Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk are thus described as vital steps in the defeat of Germany, while the Anglo-American strategic bombing offensive is usually denigrated. The year 1943 is also important because it was the first year during which German armaments production began to expand dramatically. German war production, as is widely known, was surprisingly limited during the first years of the Second World War. Inefficient utilisation of economic resources in 1939, 1940, and 1941 led to only marginal increases. Between the beginning of 1940 and the end of 1941, total German armament production hardly increased at all.16  In almost every area of weaponry Germany was actually outproduced, in quantity if not in quality, by its opponents before 1943. From this point on home defense received the lion's share of new German production. By 1 January 1944, over 54 per cent of all Luftwaffe operational front-line aircraft strength was in Germany or the West resisting the bomber offensive, with an additional 10 per cent in the Mediterranean and approximately 35 per cent on the Eastern Front.  This kind of deployment would continue for much of the rest of the war. At the same time that the West was soaking up more and more German air resources, it was destroying proportionally more and more as well. Air combat for the Luftwaffe was always more dangerous against the British and Americans than against the Russians. The technological inferiority of the Soviets led to a considerably smaller percentage of German losses on the Eastern Front, even when the Luftwaffe was greatly outnumbered by the Red Air Force. As a point of comparison 3,936 German planes were lost fighting the British and American air forces in the Mediterranean between January and November 1943, while only 3,773 aircraft were lost on the Eastern Front.  When one adds the even larger figure of 4,225 aircraft lost in either Western Europe or the defense of the Reich in the same period, it becomes clear that the British and Americans played by far the largest role in tying down and destroying the German air force in 1943. In percentage terms about 68.5 per cent of all German losses were caused by the British and Americans and the remaining 31.5 per cent by the Russians. These increased losses are extremely important because 1943, as said above, was a year in which German aircraft production leapt markedly. Almost all of this increase occurred in fighter construction. In 1943 the Germans built 10,898 fighters compared to 5,515 the year before.39 However, the Germans were unable to reap any advantage from this extremely large production increase because it was almost all diverted or destroyed by the even larger effort put forward by the Western Allies. Instead of being able to overwhelm the technologically-inferior Russian Air Force on the Eastern Front, the Luftwaffe saw its newest and most professional units continually ground down over Germany's own skies. Again, when one compares the allocation of German fighters at the beginning and the end of 1943 the importance of the West stands out clearly. In January 1943 1,045 single-engine and twin-engine fighters were based in the West running from Norway to Germany into France. At the same time280 fighters were based in the Mediterranean and Balkans, and 445 were fighting in Russia. By 1 January 1944 the number of German fighters in the West had grown by 605 to 1,650, while the corresponding figures for the Mediterranean had grown by 85 to 365 and that for the Eastern Front had actually dropped by 20 to 425.

A trickster god could *hypothetically* use what looks exactly like evolution or even produce the patterns that evolution produces but then we’re back to talking about ad hoc excuses and not scientific theories.   There’s one surviving theory of biodiversity. It does include several sub-theories such as the theory of natural selection and the more complex version of this that includes genetic drift, but there really isn’t much of a contender.   You have religious extremists over there saying “you can’t prove it **wasn’t** God because he could be very deceptive” and you have the scientific theory. The other ideas were already falsified like YEC, the spontaneous generation of complex life, advanced alien visitation, and a whole lot of other things that are directly precluded by the evidence. You have a model/explanation/theory built from the evidence and over a century and a half of describing what we observe and predicting what we should expect if it’s true where the predictions also turn out to be true and you have people saying “you can’t prove God **didn’t** do it.”   There’s no reason to consider unsupported assertions. If God did it show me that God exists.   If you can’t we’re right back where we started.   If creationists want to “correct” the scientific consensus they only have to correct that one theory but, unfortunately for them, they aren’t left with many options. It either happens as it seems to happen or someone is fucking with us. Who is that? Do they exist?   If they can’t even develop a testable model they don’t have a competing theory. There’s only one still standing theory left with the falsification of various creationist ideas, Lamarckism, phyletic gradualism, and orthogenesis. They knew that Darwinism alone wasn’t right but ever since the 1920s the theory of biological evolution has been corrected enough that what’s left and still wrong isn’t likely to be enough to throw off the theory at large. “God did it” still appears to look like God did it through biological evolution happening as described by the theory. Only something blocking us from seeing the truth could possibly completely overturn that conclusion in the favor of something like YEC.  And YECs are the ones most opposed to us considering the theory of biological evolution more or less an accurate factual explanation of biological evolution. They are the ones who need the theory to not be accurate about almost anything at all except for what they already accept because it’s too obviously true, like natural selection.', 'How else would you word it?   I mean “evolution is just a theory like the theory of gravity, oxygen theory, the germ theory of disease, or the theory about the shape of the Earth” does pretty much convey what I’m trying to say. I already said that we know the theory of gravity isn’t absolutely true and we also know that there’s a high possibility that all of these others will have some small mistakes that have been overlooked by practically everyone, but just treating the ideas as “best guess based on what we know so far” we just run into the opposite problem.  Then it turns into “you and I just interpret the same evidence differently.” How do you know it’s the best explanation so far? Doesn’t that require that you know that it’s more accurate (“factual”) than the other ideas put forth?   That’s why I said that it’s a fact that evolution happens and that it’s a fact that when we observe evolution happening that the theory describes what we observe. Mutations, heredity, genetic drift, selection, the whole bit. The theory may not be absolutely correct in every regard but it seems to be pretty damn close as we don’t find the same types of inconsistencies with the theory of biological evolution as we do when we try to make the theory of gravity work on the quantum scale.   At this point it’s time to just stop beating around the bush. The current theory of biological evolution is the only theory that still stands. There are possible ways it could be wrong and the corrections will be made as they are discovered but it’s not like Intelligent Design or some alternative idea is even in the same playing field. We shouldn’t give credence to ideas that don’t deserve it. We don’t have to wait for absolute truth to consider an idea correct.   “Factual” in the colloquial sense applies to things like the theory of evolution, the theory of oxygen, and the law of gravity. In science we just reserve “fact” for points of data. Theories are always open to revision **even if no revision is required** because if they weren’t they’d have to be replaced or we’d stay wrong. They remain the best explanation for the evidence so far and that stays the case even if they’re never falsified because they aren’t false.  Another way to look at it without calling the theory itself factual would be to consider every aspect of the theory and all of the sub-theories that make it up, such as the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, and work out how many times the theory is built upon and backed by factual data. Now we don’t have to call the theory a fact but any replacement to it will still have to account for all of the same facts the current theory already accounts for and it’ll have to do it in such a way that doesn’t rely on ad-hoc fallacies and apologetic excuses. It’ll have to be something built from the evidence rather than altered simply to avoid being precluded by it.', 'You can also say that the theory is factual, in the colloquial sense, being as observed evolution happens as the theory suggests it should. The theory is built from facts and it has led to many confirmed predictions and it’s about as close to a factually accurate description of biological evolution and how it works.   In science “fact” is more like a verified/demonstrated/observed data point but that doesn’t mean that theories aren’t all pretty much all factual to some degree. It’s a fact that evolution happens pretty much as the theory says it happens and not just that evolution happens at all.   Creationists have very little trouble accepting that evolution happens at all. It’s the explanation for how evolution happens, the evolutionary history or life, the concept of universal common ancestry, and how this *could* be extended to include a large portion of what we call “abiogenesis” considering how autocatalytic RNA molecules evolve and form spontaneously via ordinary physics and chemistry. The problem is when God is taken out of the equation. That’s why they treat science like it’s an atheist cult that a lot of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Taoists, etc. participate in. I’ve even had people tell me that science is just one giant conspiracy that the people trying to prove each other wrong don’t realize they are propagating.   It’s a fact that the theory of biological evolution is pretty damn factual. It’s also a fact that populations change. Creationists object to the first but they can’t hide from the second. It’s too obvious.  **Edit:** In terms of calling the theory “factual” I should reiterate this by stating that the theory describes how evolution happens and then when we watch evolution happen it’s the same as the theory describes. There may be some nuance or you could hypothetically say that there’s a god toying with us by creating things that only match our expectations when it comes to what we didn’t watch evolve. You could say we’ve been implanted with false memories when it comes to what we’ve observed.   You can make up all sorts of unfounded assumptions about what might really be going on that we only mistake as the theory providing an actual factual description of evolution, but outside of these unfounded assumptions you’ll see a one to one correlation between what the theory says happens and what observe happening. There’s always room for improvement and there’s always the hypothetical chance we’re wrong, but I had a rather drawn out discussion about how we can’t consider theories factual because that implies that we already found the absolute truth, or something along those lines.   To be clear, this was never my intention. The theory of evolution is one of the best supported theories in science. It’s the most hated by fundamentalists. It’s withstood over a century of scrutiny. It holds up. What it describes is what we see. It’s like the germ theory of disease, oxygen theory, or the the theory about the shape of our planet. It’ll always be the provisional truth just in case we’re wrong, but at this point in time there’s no reason to consider it a false explanation for how evolution occurs. It seems pretty accurate. As far as we can tell it provides a factual explanation. As such, it’s not too absurd to treat it as such.']

The LtV is *Explicitly* a theory about how the magnitude of value is exactly equal to the magnitude of embodied labor time.    A theory of value that only applies to mass produced fungible commodities (and only when they are at equilibrium prices) hardly seems like a good theory.   Why not stick with subjective value theory? It applies to all goods at all times.    Congrats! You’ve now admitted that the LTV is just a subjective theory of value. If the price of labor is subjectively determined by the laborer’s needs and wants, then all value is subjectively determined!  Marx made the same error and was unable to reconcile this with his assertion that values are objective.', "" No, socially necessary labour time is the time an aveeage worker needs to produce given product. Think of it as a percentage of the total productive capacity of a country spent on a good or a service. Production of mudpies do take a percentage but doesn't contribute any use value.   SNLT is labour time, not money. Money is the universal exchage token for trading goods on the market. Labour is the universal cost of producing them. The monetary value (Price) of given type of labour on the market is revenue minus expenses (Not including salary) but the actually paid value is only the salary and the rest is profit for the employer.    Yeah LTV doesn't deal with useless stuff but isn't contradicted by them either. This is not to say that LTV is the end all and be all of economics. Far from it. Both the Subjective theory of value and the Marginal theory of value have their place but keep in mind all theories use the term value but actually mean very different things.   The SNLT of mudpies is not changed. How many hours of work are needed to produce something isnt affected by how good or bad it is for society. Of course is society is damaged by something like and decides it is worth it to get rid of it that consumes labour time as well but is a second calculation of the SNLT of a service with a positive impact. Use value (utility) can be negative such as the example with nuclear waste on its own or positive such as a wanted product. Value (SNLT) can not be negative because no method of production consumes negative  time. Finally the exchage value (Price) is the relationship between one comodity and the market (aka. all alternative purchases).  It is essential to differentiate between the 3 terms in order to understand the LTV. Thinking solely in dollars is easier but can tell you only 1/3 of the LTV.""]"

In 2002-2003, it was discovered that the Service was contributing far more than necessary to fully fund its pensions, and Congress allowed the Service to contribute less to the Pension Plan. Congress decided the pension “savings” could help patch the retiree health benefit underfunding.   CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE December 27, 2006  H.R. 6407 (enacted as Public Law 109-435) changes the laws that govern the operation of the United States Postal Service (USPS), **particularly those regarding the cost of pensions and health care benefits of retired workers and the requirement to hold certain funds in escrow.**  (The) CBO estimates that H.R. 6407 will result in on-budget savings of $44.2 billion and offbudget costs of $45.7 billion over the 2007-2016 period. (The net expenditures of the USPS are classified as “off-budget.”) **Thus, CBO estimates the net cost to the unified budget will be $1.5 billion over the 2007-2016 period.** All of those effects reflect changes in direct spending. The legislation does not affect federal revenues.  H.R. 6407 will not affect how much the federal government spends on pension or health care benefits for USPS retirees. By changing how much the Postal Service pays to finance those benefits and by eliminating the escrow account requirements, however, **the act will decrease future budget deficits—as measured by the unified federal budget—for 2007 through 2010,** and will increase deficits for 2011 through 2016.  Eliminating the requirement that the USPS maintain an escrow account for the savings from legislation enacted in 2003 will allow the Postal Service to increase spending for capital improvements or other projects, pay down its outstanding debt, postpone or diminish future rate increases, or some combination of these options   ------ Yea the Postal Employees actually prefer the current system.

The shift in the mail mix from First-Class Mail to lower revenue-per piece classes has resulted in stagnant revenue growth and shrinking contribution. By 2008 1st Class Mail fell into a steep decline in  the Great Recession of 2008. From 2008 to 2010, First-Class Mail volume declined by 13.4 billion pieces.   * This decline persisted through 2010, beyond the official end of the recession.   As bad as the First-Class Mail decline was, it was dwarfed by the decline in Marketing Mail/Spam Mail. USPS had projected that, Standard Mail volume would have had to grow by 43.2 billion pieces by 2010 to help in revenue offsetting. Rather than increasing from 2008 to 2010, Standard Mail volume fell by 16.6 billion pieces.  * The 2008 recession was a true advertising depression. In 2008, Standard Mail volume declined by 4.3 percent, only slightly worse than the 3 percent decline in 2002 recession. Rather than recovering as it did in 2003, Standard Mail went into a nose dive, falling 16.8 percent more in 2009  Having lost First Class Mail in 2008, the USPS was dependent on Junk Mail post 2008 Recession.

What logical argument is there that universe and everything in it is deterministic?', ""Let me simplify my argument for you. You are stating that to prove we have free will, you would have to prove that life is not deterministic. But logically, life must be deterministic, so that cannot be disproven. However, while it is easy to give evidence that life is deterministic, you have no evidence that the fact that it is deterministic means you cannot simultaneously have free will.  Compatibilism holds that determinism can exist simultaneously with autonomy. I somewhat agree with this, but I do not believe necessarily that people have full autonomy. Compatibiliists also believe, if I understand correctly, that humans are either free or they are not. I do not agree with that. I am saying that there's every possibility that humans are both free and not free simultaneously. And that possibility could exist in different forms. Perhaps it means people are partially free. Or perhaps it means that Free Will and Not Free Will are not true opposites. Or perhaps it means that they are different dimensions of something larger. I know what I'm saying is hard to understand. That's why I used the examples. You are right that the computer one is a poor one.  And I wasn't clear whether you were stating that autonomy is synonymous with free will. Since you reject the analogy of pouring water on someone, clearly you don't see them as the same. I think the equator analogy fits my view best. Regardless of the river analogy, and whether you can move side to side, on the equator if you go exactly down the line, you are going a straight line. You cannot deviate. However, that straight line is also a circle when looked at from a different dimension. Or an oval when looked at through another one. What I'm getting at is that free will and determinism are not necessarily the same measurement even if they are measuring the same thing."", ""Well for a start, your original definition of determinism is obviously incorrect because clearly every person has a will. But it states that they do not. You post is not even questioning whether people have will or not. You are questioning whether that will is free. For instance, if I pour a glass of water on your lap, I did that because I wanted to. That is my will. But was that decision free to make? That is the biggest problem with your original definitions.  Now, as to disproving your main argument, you seem to believe that because people's actions are predetermined, that they cannot also choose to do those actions. However, that is not necessarily the case. It is very common in the Americas and Europe to think that two opposites cannot coexist, cannot be partially true, or cannot be both false. However, often in life these are not the case. For example, is the equator a straight line or a circle? It is both. Are dogs dangerous or safe? Both. Neither.  It depends. Similarly, both Free Will and determinism can coexist. Here are some scenarios to help explain:  1) Perhaps life is like a river. You are forced to go down it, and you cannot fight the current so nothing you do will make you go down any slower. However, you do not need to fight the current to go side to side. So while your destination is predetermined, you are still making your own actions in some ways.   2) If you design a true AI, and then ask it whether it would like an apple, it chooses that apple for itself. But at the same time, you designed the programming that let it choose that apple, and you engineer the situation that gave it that apple. So in that way, even though it is a pure AI, it is not making its own choice. Yet, it is. So from its perspective, it does have free will, but from our perspective, it only has partial free will. One might say the same about god. From and overarching perspective, we have no free will, but from an individual perspective, we do.  3) There are consequences for the actions you do, if I were to pour water on your lap, what would be your response? You would probably yell at me and tell me not to do that. But why? If life is deterministic, by your argument I didn't have a choice in the matter. But clearly, I did.  4) Perhaps free will and determinism aren't reversible at all and perhaps that is a logical or mathematical fallacy. Perhaps they are related or dependent on each other, but not on the same scale. When one thing leads to another, that doesn't mean the reverse will also be true. For instance, if I said that all people would like to die rather than be brain dead, it is not also true that all people would like to live if they're not brain dead.""]"

He said I didn\'t need one.** I disagreed. While it\'s true that certain scientific discoveries or techniques are so well established that their sources are no longer referenced in the contemporary literature, that didn\'t seem to be the case with the HIV/AIDS connection. **It was totally remarkable to me that the individual who had discovered the cause of a deadly and as-yet-uncured disease would not be continually referenced in the scientific papers until that disease was cured and forgotten.** But as I would soon learn, the name of that individual - who would surely be Nobel material - was on the tip of no one\'s tongue.”   “After ten or fifteen meetings over a couple years, I was getting pretty upset when no one could cite the reference. I didn\'t like the ugly conclusion that was forming in my mind: The entire campaign against a disease increasingly regarded as a twentieth century Black Plague was based on a hypothesis whose origins no one could recall. That defied both scientific and common sense.     **Finally, I had an opportunity to question one of the giants in HIV and AIDS research, DL Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute,** when he gave a talk in San Diego. It would be the last time I would be able to ask my little question without showing anger, and I figured Montagnier would know the answer. So I asked him.     **With a look of condescending puzzlement, Montagnier said, ""Why don\'t you quote the report from the Centers for Disease Control? ""**     **I replied, ""It doesn\'t really address the issue of whether or not HIV is the probable cause of AIDS, does it?""**     **”No,"" he admitted, no doubt wondering when I would just go away.** He looked for support to the little circle of people around him, but they were all awaiting a more definitive response, like I was.     **”Why don\'t you quote the work on SIV [Simian Immunodeficiency Virus]?"" the good doctor offered.**     **”I read that too, DL Montagnier,"" I responded. ""What happened to those monkeys didn\'t remind me of AIDS. Besides, that paper was just published only a couple of months ago. I\'m looking for the original paper where somebody showed that HIV caused AIDS.**     This time, DL **Montagnier\'s response was to walk quickly away to greet an acquaintance across the room.”**     “We have not been able to discover any good reasons why most of the people on earth believe that AIDS is a disease caused by a virus called HIV. There is simply no scientific evidence demonstrating that this is true.     We have also not been able to discover why doctors prescribe a toxic drug called AZT (Zidovudine) to people who have no other complaint other than the fact that they have the presence of antibodies to HIV in their blood. In fact, we cannot understand why humans would take this drug for any reason.”  http://www.duesberg.com/viewpoints/kintro.html']"

You saying so does not make it so. Everything I wrote was correct, although it could be further expounded upon to provide more clarity. Furthermore, nothing I wrote contradicted itself, so I don't know were this idea is from.   I should have been more clear, I was talking about the slums you see in most of Africa and Asia, especially in India. Nobody actually owns the land the slums are on in any official or legal sense, nobody holds title to the land. What this means is that a person cannot seek any legal recourse for theft or damage, nor will anybody be punished for infringing on what the people own. This is why you see shacks built on top of or touching the shacks of others. A person cannot stop another from building on top of them or touching them, since they do not own their land. People cannot build nice homes or apartments in these places because they hold no title to land, meaning that it will be taken over by squatters before they can plan and construct something other than a basic shack. People cannot provide utilities to their homes for the same reason, having title means people tap into your power, water, sewage, etc. and you would have no legal recourse. There can be no planning and organization and vision for this area, since no land is secure and stable.   This is just not so. Capitalism is a system that recognizes private property and respects it, unfortunately, in many places there is no respect for private property and no protections for it, as in the case of the slums, where people have no legal or official title to land. Nobody recognizes the ownership of the land. There is a movement to help people in 3rd world countries get legal title to their lands so that they can seek recourse and protection, which is a great development."", ' There\'s no such thing as ""the owner"", nor is land being sold against anybody\'s will. Empty land has no owner, by every legal definition it reverts to the public or the commons after years of disuse or having never been used. This is the fundamental problem: capitalist ideology propagates disinformation, as if there\'s existential squares written on a map somewhere by political sanctity.  Ownership is a broad spectrum of Rights receding and proceeding over time, the only issue are ""claims"" when it comes up in the judicial system. The state does not actually sell land, it sells deeds and titles. Land is just the surface of the earth and it doesn\'t move.  Here\'s an example of the contradiction:   Of course they do, ownership is established by law everywhere in the occupancy of land.   They do hold title to the land, hence the effort to formalize that as you mentioned later.   That\'s because their government is weak, and doesn\'t have any normal means to prosecute what you\'ve just described. It\'s not because of lacking some weirdly existential ""title"". By any normal customary use of land, each shack has a ""curtilage"" which extends the zone of dominion from the structure etc.  You\'re telling me that free concerts when people put down their blankets, it\'s normal to edge my space right up to yours and intrude on your enjoyment. It\'s definitely NOT normal, and concertgoers tend to complain to each other if somebody was parked too close.   If we live in a culture that\'s founded on disrespect and nobody cares, then it might look like a third world slum. You need a magical fetish to ""make"" it be title, even though all titles derive from possession at some point.    There\'s rowhouses and apartment dwellings in every modern city, but I doubt you\'d question the title of real estate in that instance.   That is completely wrong, people are not assigned the existential ownership of land in any case. You believe in a false god here, called ""deed trespassing"". All trespass consists of invading actual space or constructively belonging to another. The development of slums in the third world is happening according to the customary standard of that area, and it would be the same if legal title was recognized to build row houses and condos. Everything would touch, and get built right on top of each other like in every other Urban environment.   Notice you cannot define that property, which doesn\'t appear to be private either. I\'m talking about constant sales of land, which results in the development of vacant areas or their reversion to public use. All titles are subject to all other claims anyway, so it\'s just a method of selling off the public domain.  That\'s how tax sales work, there\'s no guarantee that deed has any efficacy or merchantability for any purpose. It\'s just selling off the potential of state dominion, and then you have to work it out in the Civil environment. The land described may not even exist, and this is publicly disclaimed by every tax authority.   Of course they do, it\'s all context to the environment.', "" This was my misunderstanding then. I thought you were talking about reselling all land, not just vacant lands.      Nobody actually owns the land the slums are on in any official or legal sense        Of course they do, ownership is established by law everywhere in the occupancy of land.  This is not a contradiction. In much of the world, people are technically living on land illegally, as much of the land is owned by the government or has no official claim, which is why governments routinely engage in slum clearing operations, bulldozing the slums or why they can forcibly relocate these people. Furthermore, a large number of people cannot go to court to defend their property or seek protection from the government because they don't have legal ownership. Governments don't recognize the property of hundreds of millions of people around the world, meaning they don't legally own the land.      They do hold title to the land, hence the effort to formalize that as you mentioned later.  People actually do not hold title to the land the live on in much of the world. It is simple and easy to look this up. In many of the poorest countries, almost all land is owned by the government, with large populations technically being squatters. Only about 30% of the population worldwide has actual title to their lands. There is a reason there is constant conflict over land in places like Africa, there is a reason people don't invest in their property, it is because they hold no legal title.   I am not talking about hypotheticals from countries with property rights, I am talking about actual practices around the world, where private property is rare and protections are weak.      There's rowhouses and apartment dwellings in every modern city, but I doubt you'd question the title of real estate in that instance.  This is completely different and has nothing to do with what I was talking about, therefore irrelevant.   Townhouses and Row houses are very different from slums and are able to be developed because of private ownership of land. It should be obvious the differences between a slum with no property ownership and a townhouse or row house and how these come to be developed.    I don't think you understand how property works. Simply living on land does not make it yours. Having title to land certifies that it is yours and allows you to legally force someone off your land and gives you the right to go to court to protect land since you have proof that it is yours.""]"

Same argument for ""convenient"": you could argue it is more convenient to do it as a baby compared to an adult, but this doesn\'t count if the adult just doesn\'t get piercings at all.   This has no value. If an adult didn\'t get pierced as a baby and wants to, they can; the opposite isn\'t really possible, as after 10 years of having them they\'ll take a lot to close and/or will leave visible scar tissue; not to mention people who end up with crooked piercings because they were done too young.', 'Not every adult wants pierced ears. By piercing them as a baby, the parent is depriving the child of the choice not to pierce them ever.', 'Yeah, most adult women have pierced ears, that doesn’t mean they wanted them since we are acknowledging that it’s often done when they’re quite young. That’s the discussion. So the number of women that have pierced ears isn’t relevant, it’s not reversible after a certain point. FWIW I had my ears pierced very young and a have a lot of other piercings and tattoos. The only one I wish I could take back is my ears. I hate them and I wish they weren’t pierced. The only way to “reverse” them is to go to a plastic surgeon and have them closed because they were done when I was a child. I don’t use them, I hate the way they look, and I don’t know if the scars incurred by fixing them is worth it. So the fact that I fall into the statistic of “adult woman with pierced ears” does not mean “woman who wants or wanted pierced ears” because I didn’t and I don’t.']"

Humans have a lot of attention biases, and I\'m sure you\'re paying more attention to those drivers who are going fast along with you than the ones who are going much slower in the right lane.  I\'ve been ticketed for going 72 in a 55, and I\'ve been ticketed for going 85 in a 70, both Ohio (I don\'t even live in Ohio lol). I don\'t speed &gt;5mph since I got hit by a car who was speeding recklessly, but I used to speed. I do a ton of regular interstate driving, although admittedly just around the MidWest. It\'s very possible that you live near a particular highway that\'s technically a 55 but functions like a 70mph highway.  On your average 55mph highway tho, it\'s definitely more dangerous to be going 80-85mph. On a 70mph highway, going 95-100mph is insane and reckless. I agree that some politicians need to hurry up on updating the speed limits on some rural intrastate highways, but saying that ""25-30mph over the limit"" is a safe rule of thumb is wrong and dangerous. Just slow down a little bit man, you\'re gonna get there just fine.', 'At this point, I literally don\'t understand what you\'re talking about.   You, earlier: ""A decent driver can easily go 10 to 15 MPH over without a substantial risk of an accident, and on a highway, that number just increases""  You said that it\'s safe to go more than 15mph on the highway. Most highways are 70mph. I don\'t get what you\'re trying to argue here.   Again, completely wrong. The study showed that the average person goes a little over 65 in a 55 **interstate highway**, not 70. This has nothing to do with your primary contention, which you STILL refuse to provide a source for: that the average driver regularly goes 10-15mph **on most roads**. I guess you can\'t find a source for it, unsurprisingly.  # The fact that people speed 11mph over the limit on one specific type of interstate highway does not in any way prove that it\'s SAFE to drive 10-15mph over on all roads.   This is just goofy. I never implied that there are kids getting hit left and right, you just imagined it in your head.   Hahaha. At this point, I\'m convinced you\'re either trolling or the densest dude on Reddit. You really think people are more likely to be struck by lightning than killed in a car crash? In case you really need to know, the difference between lightning deaths vs vehicular deaths is \\~2000 vs 37,461. I\'m not gonna source that; if you need a source to know more people die by car than by lightning, then you need to go outside for once in your life.  Still waiting on any sources for your arguement, or for you to make an affirmative case for why it\'s okay to speed in spite of the excess risk of harm to others.', 'Lmao, I absolutely love how you keep demanding that I provide a source for my factual claims, but provide 0 sources for your factual claims.   But since you asked, sure! [Here\'s a study from Perdue University,](https://www.ibtta.org/sites/default/files/Speed%20Limit%20and%20factors%20safety.pdf) which found that ""The standard deviation of normal driving speeds above the posted speed limit was 6.21 mph for 55 mph speed limits, 5.10 mph for 65 mph speed limits and 5.35 mph for 70 mph speed limits"".   So, like I said, the average driver is going 5-7mph over the posted speed limit. Do you have sources proving most people drive 10-15mph over the speed limit on most roads, or did you just pull that out of your ass?  &amp;#x200B;   Okay? What\'s your point? Is it any better if kids die in a car accident than if they are hit by a car?

Empowerment is just as much about feeling empowered as it is about actual physical or social power.  To me a woman should be able to do what she wants with her body, be that sell images of it on OF or not. As long as she understands the risks involved, I see no issue. Rather than saying “selling pictures of you isn’t empowering, don’t do it” i’d rather try and change the perception of sexuality so that it isn’t a bad thing at all.  Hell i’d argue that honestly, the thoughts of the people buying your pictures is irrelevant… are they viewing you as a sexual object? Technically I guess. But so what? That’s what you’re selling, not sure you should really expect them to be genuinely invested i.n you as a person. What i think matters is how the people around you treat you, like friends, family and acquaintances… that’s the stigma we need to try and change.

Like someone will say ""OF empowers me"" and the other person assumes they mean sexually or something, but they actually mean financially.  I think objectifying yourself can still lead to empowerment. Confidence is empowering. The risk is in valuing yourself less because of how you think people treat or view you, but if that doesn\'t affect you, then what they think is immaterial. Empowerment in this context is just a feeling, right? It doesn\'t have any external meaning.  I think it\'s less about fulfilling people\'s sexual desires that\'s empowering, and more about making them desire you. It\'s controlling someone\'s feelings (and actions, when they pay you for it).']"

Les choses que tu dis n'auraient jamais été acceptés pour personne.  Je le trouve ridicule que tu peux utiliser ça comme un argument s'il n'y a pas d'outrage. C'est plus ridicule que ton argument est de dire que les gouvernements élus démocratiquement ont supprimé ça. Pour moi c'est contradictoire. Les québécois sont un peuple fier mais à même temps ils sont un peu de soumis. Dis-moi comment est-ce que ce que tu dis fait du sens ?    C'est une excuse, c'est ce que tu dis. Si le fédéral avait triché, et les séparatistes avaient évidence ils pouvaient faire quelque chose. Je ne sais pas si t'as réalisé mais c'est impossible d'argumenter en contre de toi. Il y a une explication pour tout sans importance s'ils sont ridicules et irréalistes.    C'est trop mal pour eux, mais le fédéral est correct. Ford et Smith sont un peu d'imbéciles et ils veulent détruire le système de la santé. Tu pense seulement au Québec. Moi, je penses au Canada, et je suis d'accord que le fédéral doivent imposer conditions. C'est les premiers qui sont en faute de cet embarrass avec Covid. En tous les cas c'était Trudeau qui devais intervenir, en Alberta et en Ontario, parce que Ford et Kenney ne savaient pas comme gérer la situation. C'est mal pour Québec, mais trop mal nous sommes partis d'une fédération. C'est comme ça que les choses fonctionnent.    Bien, je suis désolée. J'étais incorrect. Mais, je ne comprends pas pourquoi les immigrants sont une chose pour les séparatistes. Si on décide de déménager au Québec sans français on aura une mauvaise expérience, même dans Montréal.   C'est une stupidité complète de faire ça, et les nouvelles lois l'ont fait plus difficile, chose avec laquelle je n'ai pas de problème. Même si la plupart qui viennent ici apprendre.  Pour conclure ces statistiques m'indique qu'il y à plus gens qui parle les deux langues au lieu d'un. Pourquoi est-ce que c'est mauvais ?  C'est comme j'avais dis, c'est pas sur le français, c'est sur le séparatisme et son manque de pertinence. Les séparatistes vont a créer tous les homes de pailles pour dire que la culture québécoise va disparaître, mais c'est pas ça qui va disparaître, c'est le séparatisme. La culture québécoise n'est pas en recul, elle change et évolue, les séparatistes ont peur parce qu'elles n'ont pas un lieu dans cette nouvelle culture.

Ça ne marche pas pour moi. Sinon, c\'est pas différent des choses que Trump et ses partisans font quand ils disent que leur élection avait été volé. La spéculation sur gouvernements libéraux élus démocratiquement ne m\'intéresse pas. Si tu me vas dire qu\'ils ont triché aussi, ne t\'embêté pas. Tes arguments ne sont pas valides. Tu ne peux pas juste venir ici, dire que le ""non"" a volé le referendum et que leurs gouvernements ont supprimé le mouvement de l\'indépendance.  J\'ai besoin de plus qu\'articles et choses qu\'un juge avait dit. En plus, il n\'y a pas d\'outrage, si les choses que t\'as dites étaient vraies, la société québécoise n\'aurait jamais accepté ça. Ce que tu dis est impossible, et si c\'est un point commun des souverainistes, il sera moins possible de que je leur donne mon soutien. On ne peut pas simplement nier le choix des gens, et le choix dans 1995 était ""non"". Si tu veux une autre referendum, bien, tu peux exiger ça, mais tu ne peux jamais dire que les choix des gens sont invalides à cause de spéculation des articles.   Oui, et c\'est pour ça que le Québec à pouvoir pour changer ces décisions, en plus d\'avoir un parti fédéral, chose que les autres provinces n\'ont pas. Je suis désolée, mais ces choses sont les conditions pour être partie du Canada, chose que le Québec avait décidé de faire dans 1980 et 1995. C\'est la loi, si tu ne l\'aimes pas, chiale aux autres québécois qui ont décidé de rester au Canada.   C\'est trop mal pour toi, parce que les traites sont avec le fédéral, pas avec Québec, et les autochtones ont dit maintes et maintes fois qu\'ils ne vont pas négocier avec Québec.   Dis-le dans la rue, alors. Quel est le problème ? Si tu ne le trouves pas acceptable à le dire comme ça, pourquoi est-ce qu\'il est acceptable de le dire dans un débat télévisé en face d\'un femme noire ? Est-ce que les politiciens séparatistes ont carte blanche à dire ce qu\'ils veulent ?   Quel est le problème ici ? Est-ce que c\'est impossible de trouver un compromis ? Legault parait qu\'il est ouvert à ça, non ?  Honnêtement, je suis fini. Si tu ne vas pas donner évidence valide pour dire que le fédéral a volé l\'élection, alors ces sont mensonges, mensonges qui ont le même caractère que les mensonges de Trump.  C\'est la même chose avec le n-word, tu ne peux pas attendre que j\'accepte ton explication si tu vas me dire que c\'est incorrecte de dire le n-word dans la rue, mais pas dans un débat télévisé où il y a une femme noire.  C\'est assez, il n\'y aura jamais un compromis entre moi et les séparatistes. Je voterai toujours contre eux. Leur cause ne m\'a pas donné une bonne raison de penser qu\'ils savent que c\'est ce qu\'ils font. Tes arguments moins.  Je ne vois pas une voie ou je serai d\'accord avec l\'indépendance. Ce mouvement est un poison, et c\'est plein de fanatiques.', "" C'est la nature de ces choses, t'as ton point de vue et j'ai le mien, mais peut-être, il y a un compromis. Je continuerai cette conversation en français, et nous nous comprendrons dans la langue du Québec.    Plus évidence. Je ne crois pas qu'un article de 2013 et une affirmation d'un juge sont assez pour dire que le referendum était invalide.  Non, c'est pas assez, si tu vas dire ces choses, to dois avoir évidence qui le confirme 100%. Comprends-tu ce que tu dis ? C'est une accusation sérieuse et si les choses étaient comme ça, alors, j'aurais attendu à un outrage. La société québécoise n'aurait jamais accepté ça.    Dans les médias anglos. Qu'est-ce que tu vas dire ? Que ça ne compte pas ? Pourquoi pas ? Non, c'est complètement raciste. Il y avait un million d'autres choses à dire et PSPP avait choisi de dire le n-word et de forcer à une autre personne a le dire aussi. Les deux chefs séparatistes l'ont dit, en face d'une femme noire, en plus du monde entier. Plus tu combats ce point, moins je fais confiance à ce mouvement. Il y a 0 justifications pour ce comportement, 0. C'est pas une chose culturelle, non, on ne dit jamais le n-word, et ce n'est pas une chose anglaise. Si tu penses d'autre manière, je mets au défi d'aller dire ça au milieu de la rue.  En France, on ne peut pas dire ces choses, moins à Montréal. Il n'y a aucune raison pourquoi je devrais accepter ce type de choses dans un débat télévisé.    Oui, c'est pas facile pour moi. J'aime le Québec, plus que mon ancien pays. Québec c'est chez-moi. Je ne veux pas avoir à choisir entre eux, et les séparatistes ne comprennent pas la difficulté de ces choses pour nous, les immigrants. Il y a plusieurs personnes que disaient de choses méchantes pour nos choix. Nous n'avons pas choisi d'être insérés dans ce conflit, mais nous recevons les balles des deux côtés. Oui, il y a des anglos imbéciles qui viennent à dire choses tout le temps, spécialement quand on défend aux québécois et au Québec. Ils ont beaucoup à dire aussi. Par exemple, je suis d'accord que le serment au roi est une stupidité. Un imbécile anglo m'avait dit que c'était temps pour moi de sortir du Canada, et que si on était dans les temps anciens, ils m'auraient viré sans problème et qu'il n'aurait pas de problème avec ça.   La seule chose que j'exige est respect. On peut croire ce qu'on veut, mais je ne comprends pas pourquoi je devrais supporter des choses comme ça.    Non, jamais, nous sommes Canadiens, pas Américains. C'est pas la même  chose de toute façon. Si le Québec sorti, Canada ne sera jamais le même chose. En plus, sais-tu les implications de ça ? Il y a plusieurs complications comme les disputes de territoire avec les autochtones, le St. Laurent, les traitres de commerce avec les [États-Unis](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/u-s-wouldn-t-have-recognized-quebec-independence-in-wake-of-yes-vote-in-1995-1.1730253). C'est un cauchemar social, économique et politique pour tout le monde.   Quand les séparatistes attendent mon soutien, ils attendent que je suis à faveur de potentiellement détruire le Canada. Ça n'arrivera jamais, pas pour moi.    Je ne sais pas, pourquoi est-ce que tu continues de faire référence à ce thème si t'as cette opinion ?    C'est pas vrai. Je suis immigrant, et je sais comme le système fonctionne. Tu ne peux pas immigrer au Québec de la même manière que le reste du Canada. Si tu fais ça, tu devrais traiter avec le gouvernement Québécois et t'as besoin de suivre leurs procédures. Si tu ne connais pas le français, bonne chance, tu ne vas pas rester au Québec. En plus, c'est pas assez d'obtenir autorisation du gouvernement québécois, tu devrais traiter avec le fédéral aussi.  Le Québec a beaucoup de pouvoir pour choisir leurs immigrants, plus que les autres provinces.    Ouais, et rappelle une chose, j'ai choisi de faire ça. Ma langue maternelle est l'espagnol, ils ne parlent pas français à mon ancien pays. J'ai fait ça avant d'arriver au Canada, qui est 130% plus que tous les autres immigrants, et en plus que les Canadiens eux-mêmes qui rarement parlent français.    J'ai choisi le Québec et Montréal comme chez-moi, pas Toronto et l'Ontario, pas Calgary et l'Alberta, et pas Vancouver et la Colombie-Britannique. C'est beaucoup d'exiger que mon opinion soit respecté ? Je ne suis pas un colonisateur, un partisan qui suivre les ordres du fédéral ou un envahisseur qui vient à supprimer la culture québécoise.   Je pense que t'es raisonnable. Ne pense pas tu, que c'est injuste quand les autres séparatistes disent ces choses méchantes ? Ne penses-tu pas que j'ai mes raisons pour ne pas vouloir soutenir un mouvement qui a des gens qui disent ces choses. En plus je ne suis pas comme les autres immigrants, s'il y a gens qui veulent trouver problèmes avec moi, je vais les faire pour eux. Je ne suis pas un tabarnak, je ne reculerai pas.""]"

And yes, CS covers all of that minus medical, but most divorced children are on Medicaid till they are 18 under the family medical act and therefore they have unlimited free medical care with mere copays and prescription costs, which can be high, but its nothing compared to being an adult and needing an arm and three legs to pay for medical.   So yes. You are the custodial parent by force, you are kidnapping his children and refusing him access. If you are not able to support yourself then why should you have children in the first place? Give the children to him, he clearly had no issue supporting all of you prior to getting wage gouged.   If the man wanted to fight for custody and you got custodial parent status anyway then you don\'t get to complain about caring for the child. You fought to be one doing this shit, you don\'t get to be ""poor me, give me some money cause I do all this"".   Now if he wants nothing to do with the kids then that\'s a different thing altogether. If he didn\'t want custody or split custody and just wants out of the family altogether then let him sign his rights away. But if he tried to be their father, and lost, and now gun wielding people are backing you up in enforcing his state sponsored kidnapping and wage slavery, then yeah, you should be ashamed that you can\'t afford rent and it makes you an unfit parent.  These things are nuanced, of course, but at the end of the day if a man pays child support it is for the child, not you, that is called alimony or spousal support.']"

The subpoenas are among a dozen issued by the plaintiffs in that suit this week.  The lawsuit was filed in March by a coalition that includes the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and several individual voters who claim the congressional boundaries approved by the Legislature in 2021 violated the Utah Constitution. The suit names Lt. Gov. Diedre Henderson, the Utah Legislature, Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson, Utah Senate President Stuart Adams and the Legislature’s Redistricting Committee as defendants.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs refused to provide a copy of the subpoenas, saying they do not publicly release such documents during litigation.  A source familiar with the case, speaking on background, told The Salt Lake the subpoenas are seeking documents and other records relating to the drawing of the new maps during the redistricting process.  Odd: Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) just had to announce to the House (via the reading clerk) that he’s been served with a subpoena from the 3rd judicial district court of Salt Lake County and has not yet decided if he's going to comply with it...  — Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) December 22, 2022   A separate court filing requesting information from the Utah Legislature demonstrates what the plaintiffs seek. They’ve asked for draft maps that weren’t approved by lawmakers, including data and analyses related to those draft plans. Plaintiffs are also seeking any communications with current or former members of Congress or legislators and members of their staff and contacts with Gov. Spencer Cox and Lt. Gov. Diedre Henderson and their team.  Plaintiffs are also seeking any contacts between lawmakers and Adam Foltz, a Republican political operative who has played a role in Wisconsin’s 2010 redistricting process that federal judges slammed as “needlessly secret.” In 2021, Foltz was hired by Republicans in the Texas Legislature to help shepherd their redistricting efforts, The Texas Tribune reported.  Lawmakers have also been asked to provide records of any contact with Adam Kincaid, who heads up the National Republican Redistricting Trust, the GOP’s main mapmaking organization.  Other Utahns subpoenaed about the case include former congressman Rob Bishop, who served on the independent redistricting commission until he resigned in protest near the end of the process, former state Rep. Paul Ray, who co-chaired the Legislature’s redistricting committee and Rex Facer, who chaired the independent commission.  The subpoenas were issued after a Utah district judge refused a request by lawyers for the state to throw out the lawsuit.  In a separate court filing from earlier this month, lawyers for the plaintiffs complained lawmakers were hiding behind a claim of “legislative privilege” to avoid answering their questions.  “No Utah court has ever recognized a special ‘legislative privilege’ to refuse to engage in discovery in a civil case, especially when the Legislature and its members have been found to be proper parties,” the filing reads.  Last month, lawyers for the state asked the Utah Supreme Court to intervene and dismiss the case. That request is still pending."", 'Romney is not a real republican', ""We're not just talking about Utah though. We are talking about 49 other states as well.

There\'s a difference between why and how.  Sexual reproduction is HOW we exist.  Sexual reproduction does not explain WHY we exist at all (aka what our purpose is).   Why we exist is a philosophical and/or religious question.  Science cannot tell us what our purpose is.   produce.  Yes but using that as a reason alone to claim the fetus isn\'t a parasite seems very arbitrary. It\'s a moral claim. He already admitted that pregnancy and the fetus does fit the general definitions of parasitism used by many biologists.  The only reason he disagrees is because he believes that the purpose of women is to be pregnant.  The only reason he doesn\'t believe it to be a parasite is because of his personal views on women.   Ah! So you\'re admitting that it\'s parasitic!   But this still does not assign purpose to any person.  The professor said that the only reason he doesn\'t consider the ZEF a parasite is because he views women being pregnant as fulfilling their genetic purpose.  This framework leaves out so many different individuals!  It leaves out infertile women. Are infertile women ""genetic failures"" simply because they cannot get pregnant?  What about lesbian women? Are they genetic failures? Gay men?  What about menopausal women? Are they no longer worthy of consideration because they cannot reproduce anymore?  Tokophobic women? Are they genetic failures wirh no purpose?  Someone in his comment section said the same thing:  *""Did you really mean to say that women exist to get pregnant, and it is “the ultimate biological purpose of (her) life?” I am sincerely asking for a clarification because it is an assertion with serious implications.""*  *""I am a gay man. Have I abdicated the biological purpose of my life? Then, we have infertile people, who would have no purpose at all. By this, I mean you seem to have overstepped by giving the science of reproduction a universal, philosophical value.""*  *""Do human lives need a biological purpose?""*  *""If “biological purpose” exists, then it can mean only reproduction. If that were true, we’d be on a quick and slippery slope toward to an over-crowded planet, and our own extinction.""*  *""In that light, we are better off a species if a significant minority of people fail to achieve this purpose, and a significant number of women fail to reproduce. But that brings the debate full circle because it means that all women do not inherently share a biological mandate.""*  Basically, this user is pointing out how over-reproduction is actually a bad thing and how it\'s evolutionary advantageous for there to be people who don\'t reproduce.  The professor didn\'t disagree with him.  Too add, Women are at peak fertility for about a 1/3 of their lifetime. I do not buy that our purpose for existing hinges on something we can do only 30 percent of our life.   Ah! You said ""those who have this feeling"" which means that you\'re recognizing that there are those who don\'t.    Absolutely false. I already explained to you that parasites do often benefit the host. Not re-explaining, I\'ll just link the comment once again:https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/zoi61d/what_is_so_bad_about_convenience_abortions/j0vsk1s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3  An example of a parasite that benefits the body is hookworms. Hookworms provide the body many benefits but they\'re still classified as parasites due to the harm they impose as well.   It makes sense to the plenty of biologists in the sources I sent you.   Even the professor you sent me said that he can see why biologists refer to it as parasitic, he just doesn\'t agree based on his own misconceptions about the purpose of women.   No, even in the comment section, he admits that part of his answer is due to philosophical reasoning.  *""There’s nothing wrong with being reductive. Reductionism is a vital tool for scientific and **philosophical understanding.**""*  So, he has already admitted that his answer is partly philosophical, it\'s not purely scientific.  What he is using is called Genetic Reductionism which is a type of Biological Determinism and it\'s highly problematic!  [Genetic reductionism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_reductionism): Genetic reductionism is the belief that understanding genes is sufficient to understand all aspects of human behavior.[1] It is a specific form of reductionism and of biological determinism, based on a perspective which defines genes as distinct units of information with consistent properties.[2] It also covers attempts to define specific phenomena in exclusively genetic terms, as in the case of the ""warrior gene"".[3]  The concept has been criticized by many biologists.[4] According to Affifi (2017), ""With the discoveries of pleiotropy and epistasis, cracks in the reductionist paradigm emerged even before the rise of molecular biology, but the full extent of the interdependency and flexible adaptivity of the genome has really come to light in the past 10 years...""[5] The genetic reductionist perspective can be appropriate when used to identify changes in specific genetic loci that cause differences in a given phenotype.[6]  [Biological determinism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_determinism): Biological determinism, also known as genetic determinism,[1] is the belief that human behaviour is directly controlled by an individual\'s genes or some component of their physiology, generally at the expense of the role of the environment, whether in embryonic development or in learning.[2] Genetic reductionism is a similar concept, but it is distinct from genetic determinism in that the former refers to the level of understanding, while the latter refers to the supposedly causal role of genes.[3]   Biological determinism has been associated with movements in science and society including **eugenics, scientific racism, and the debates around the heritability of IQ,[4] the basis of sexual orientation,[5] and sociobiology.[6]**  The professor you sent is using a philosophy that justifies eugenics, racism, and rape.   He admitted in his answer that he doesn\'t believe that animals can rape each- other (despite zoologista saying otherwise). He believes that those are just different mating strategies in order to further our ""genetic purpose""', ' Parasites can be the same species. It\'s called intraspecfic parasitism.   What does this even mean?   Absolutely false.  [The placenta is simply a neuroendocrine parasite. This, coupled to the fact that the health of the mother can be compromised for the benefit of the foeto-placental unit, means that for all intents and purposes it is behaving as a parasite.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18601692/)  [During early pregnancy the placenta-derived extravillous trophoblast starts to invade the maternal uterus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22717871/)  [Trophoblast invasion can be seen as a tightly regulated battle between the competing interests of the survival of the fetus and those of the mother.\xa0](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15590570/)  [Pregnancy can increase production of Immunoglobulin E (IgE), an immune response more often directed towards parasite infections.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28712140/)  [The same hormones that we release to fight parasitic infections are the same ones we release to try and fight off the ZEF]  [Embryo, cancer, and parasite are constituted as a systemic interaction with the host (mother). Based on these facts, the author proposed the hypothesis that in the case of mammals, ""the fetus is essentially harmful to the mother"", and that the parasitic fetus grows by skillfully evading the mother\'s foreign body exclusion mechanism.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8967296/)  [\'But immune suppression genes stand out. The fetus is genetically distinct from the mother - if these immune genes weren\'t expressed in the uterus, the fetus would be recognized by the mother\'s immune system as foreign and attacked like any other parasite.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2932863/amp/Why-humans-don-t-lay-eggs-Jumping-genes-origin-pregnancy-early-mammalian-ancestors.html#bsht=CgRmYnNtEgYIAxAAGBM)   Yeah, its called host manipulation. Most parasites do it in order to make their environment more habitual. It\'s not done to ""help the mother"". It\'s done when the pregnant person is healthy enough to expend extra resources. If the pregnant person is not healthy enough to expend extra resources, the ZEF will deplete the body as much as possible.   Why do PLers such as yourself continue to use this absolutely unreliable source?  For one, this was made in 1974 so it\'s gravely outdated by 48 years. There\'s nothing wrong with using outdated research in tandem with recent research, but if your only source is something this incredibly outdated, then that is not a good look.  Two, I find it highly suspicious that I cannot find this source anywhere else on the internet except in this blog post.  When I put their ""source"" into my search engine, it only brings me back to the same blog post.  Basically, this post credited itself as a source for their information.  I cannot find any evidence that this ""Professor Thomas L. Johnson"" even exists.  He is only ever mentioned online in this blog post.  Even searching, ""Thomas L. Johnson, pro-life"" brings up nothing but this blog post. Even when I changed it to, ""Thomas L. Johnson, 1974"" it still brings me back to this one blog post. Nothing else.   This a blog post made by a Christian website.   Nope, as you can see, they outright call them parasites.   Can you prove that they\'re not credible?   So you lied when you said you haven\'t seen a single pregnant person use language similar to parasite.']"

I’ll need to read some more articles.  I live in a place where gifted programs are alive and well. I don’t think much of them. The truly gifted who wind up accomplished create supportive communities around themselves. So gifted programs have something of an imaginary benefit. Parents feel better because their kid is in a gifted program, but said program is probably much less important to how their kid turns out than the really dominant factor - how rich are the parents?  All these gifted programs separate the kids into “winners” and “losers”. It becomes something of a social stumbling block for the “non-gifted” kids. I actually see this on a daily basis, but it is subtle. Mostly, it’s unnecessary.  Someone once told me that back in the old days they went to a school with no gifted programs. There was just Math, English, History, etc. and everyone took the same classes, went to lunch together, and went to recess. They were all just kids. Behind the scenes kids were actually grouped in classes based on which kids would actually benefit from more rigorous classes. A kid who was really motivated and good at math would be in a class with similar kids, same English, and so on. Thing is, this grouping was mostly invisible to the kids. So the kids could be kids and learn to play together. I think the “invisible” model is probably better for everyone. Because, in reality, being “gifted” doesn’t mean much without personal self-discipline and external resources from parents or other groups. We all need to date, find friends, etc. and the best people may not be academic high achievers.  In this day and age a self motivated kid can learn just about anything on the internet. The sky is really the limit. These “gifted” programs are dinosaurs and maybe we are all better off without them.']"

I agree with the spirit of what you say, but I'll also add a small caveat if that's ok.  YES, abuse survivors are WAAAY more vulnerable, as throughout childhood-their life... Their psyche and energetic systems and mind has been under assault from the parasitic-darkness, leaving them vulnerable..  Also... Older and brighter souls glow strongly in the spiritual plane as they descend to earth at the beginning of their new life.. the darkness of the enemy is drawn to such light to feed upon.  So in many ways... It is the Oldest and most powerful souls that fall prey to those human predators-bonded with the demiruge.  I agree that those who have not faced such abuse before, especially in developmental years, are WAY less vulnerable to it.  BUT, any human can be weakened and eventually broken down if exposed to acid-toxicity energy from such monsters... And some are VERY good at disguising themselves and taking their time to break someone down. (That's the caveat, that ultimately anyone can end up falling prey to such monsters).  Infact they can take great satisfaction in weakening/corrupting/slowing down.... A powerful person/soul.  Once one deeply understands parasitic-narcs, covert or otherwise.

Instead in the modern day it’s hookup culture and the lopsided nature of hookup culture. There are men who do not get married and instead hookup with tons of girls and have an extremely high partner count. There is data on this such as partner count especially once corrected for only heterosexual counts and correcting for men who increase reported counts and women who reduce their reported counts. This then shows an interesting phenomenon of 50 percentile women having much higher partner counts than 50 percentile men. This is only possible by having the low and high ends be extreme for men, the high status men getting to the high hundreds and thousands and many men having low counts.  The changes to marriage up to and including the expectations for partner counts have also shifted that deal by amplifying this effect. There are more women who do not need to place as much value on a No or small partner count and as such but because there is also no restriction on the high status men who can achieve thousands in partner counts, even though there is more partner counts out there, it’s not being well distributed and instead being concentrated to a small percentage of men.  Now I would not even necessarily solely blame any of the sources you mentioned. Some of the larger culprits include larger cities and technology to make it easier to find more people. The more people one can reasonably meet outside of area restrictions means sexual selection can occur in a wider variety of people and as such people can select off more traits and as such sex will become less distributed.  There are many factors as to why sex and relationships are less distributed then before.', ""Yes I know very well what it means and if there's something wrong with a vast majority of X then there's something inherently wrong with X most likely....   Secondly your first source is not a proper source it isn't based on national statistics or proper scientific research but writen by some lawyers with no reference to back up their claims nor actual numbers of each demograph of the sample population used to calculate these things (with also a small sample of only 3000) . Most importantly though they don't name said study nor reference it, that is ALWAYS shady.  Secondly divorces are not how one defines a relationship, people can have all kinds of different types of relationships and marriage far from is on everyone's mind.   Now let's address your other source and what it ACTUALLY SAYS, reading comprehension and checking sources are very important for that.   *Source 2,   Special report, Nonfatal Domestic Violence, 2003–2012.   Published April 2014, written by Jennifer L. Truman, Ph.D., and Rachel E. Morgan, Ph.D., BJS Statisticians.*   http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf  It means they are more likely to be abused by an intimate partner in comparison to either immediate family or another relative.  From the study,    An intimate partner includes **current or former** spouses, boyfriends, and girlfriends.   Immediate family includes parents, children, and siblings.    Quoted from the study,     Lastly from what I read from the publication that's the case for domestic violence not general abuse....  Which is also what the The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) is specifically talking about. In other words they are only comparing between these 3 categories intimate partner, immediate family, other relative.   So the only thing that bullet point on their websites says is that for 18-24 year old women are more likely to experience domestic abuse by the hands of an intimate partner in comparison to immediate family or another relative.  Now the claim you are making is not supported by your source and definitely not the source they refer to. Because that data isn't available in that report ....   So instead of making nonsense claims based on what I assume misinterpretation of data, maybe fix your prejudice/bias and read it properly instead of assuming. Because your statistics don't prove or show what you claimed ;)  If those statistics did say that then on average, yes age gaps would inherently pose issues/complications.  Finally no you never mentioned specific ages. However specific ages were very clearly written in OPs meme (22 and 30s) and should thus be assumed as the default ages in this topic unless you clearly address specific ages, which you did not.  So you're not acknowledging statistics you're misinterpreting them, likely because of assumptions that you have about behavioural patterns that you might have experienced anecdotally which is why we don't use personal experiences for statistics. Again you made assumptions probably influenced by biases you have."", ' Do you not know what word ""inherently"" means?

Divorce is 18% more likely for couples with a five-year age difference. This rises to 39% for a 10-year age difference, and when the couple has a 20-year age gap, the likelihood of divorce rises to 95%. A\xa030-year age difference\xa0means a whopping 172% chance of divorce.  [Women between the ages of 18-24](https://ncadv.org/STATISTICS) are most commonly abused by an intimate partner. Physical, mental, and sexual and reproductive health effects have been linked with intimate partner violence including adolescent pregnancy.   How have I been inconsistent? For the bazillionth time, **I\'m not saying that age gap relationships are inherently predatory**. Only that statics have repeatedly shown that certain issues are far more prevalent as age gaps often reflect an imbalance of power and therefore leave young people open to coercion or abuse.\xa0This isn\'t unique to sexual or romantic relationships either.

Hell here n sweden it was functionally impossible for coops to legally take out loans of any kind, untill just a few years ago when the law was amended.

Summary:  I ask it to use isNoun, isVerb, and isAdjective methods to improve the method by eliminating some definitely grammatically incorrect sentences.  It responds with a program that checks to make sure the first word of the sentence is a noun, and the last word of the sentence is a verb. (Oooooo....kay.) The example sentence input it uses is still ""This is  a complete sentence.""  I ask it what the program would output.   It says the program would output that that is a complete sentence, because the first word is a noun and the last word is a verb.   (It occurs to me that ""sentence"" *can* be a verb, it just isn\'t in that sentence.) I ask it whether ""sentence"" is a verb in the English language.

As Paul says when sin increased grace increased all the more and Paul should know. He called himself ""chief of sinners"" because of the time he spent hunting and murdering Christians.  The problem is that twisting scripture in small ways can lead to disastrous outcomes. This exact thing has happened with many scriptures. Where this conversation was going was ""well we\'re all sinners so does [this] sin even matter?"" Views that make light of sin always lead to sin .It\'s been the same discussion for almost 2 thousand years now. ""Well wouldn\'t more sin mean more grace?"" Paul responds to this in Romans 6.  What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 2 By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 3 Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.  Notice the exclamation mark after by no means. It\'s not very common in scripture. The words are very strong in the greek.   Anyone who would wish to be a Christian must understand the danger of sin and choose a life of fighting to be free of it by the spirit. Scripture tells us that those who take sin lightly either don\'t understand the high price that was paid for redemption or don\'t appreciate it anyway (hebrews 10:29) and will lose the grace given to them. Christ paid a high price with his own blood and suffering. The word excruciating was created to describe the unimaginable pain of literally tearing your body apart as you fight to take a breath (the cross actually kills by asphyxiation). He gave everything to put an end to sin. He expects people to respect the gravity of the situation   But yes all sin can be redeemed but twisting scripture to make certain sins look less dangerous only leads to dangerous places. If you want to know more the Book of 1 John that was half about this subject to address a similar lie that was putting greek believers in danger. Basically greeks had found a round about way of saying that if you sin it\'s really just you\'re body doing it and your not guilty of anything.

No court is going to find what I did to be gross negligence or wanton misconduct, because it is entirely in keeping with standard practices.  Even if I fuck up, say I don't treat for shock, that still wouldn't be covered because while I may be negligent, I am not grossly so.

As has been told to you previously gross negligence is generally someone doing something ridiculously stupid and will thus be quite obvious.    That's fair and I'd agree on the donating food front but I think it's not really much the case with rendering aid. Generally speaking people look very favorably on those trying to help and will only not do so when the person did something extra special dumb.    Sure I guess that could happen but really how likely is this? For the hundreds of thousands of people that get injured each year and need help how many are like mass murderers or something. Also anecdotally I've never seen any media piece to this effect.    By not rendering aid if someone dies you are responsible for not taking action that would have prevented that.

You can\'t just claim gross negligence, it will usually either be abundantly clear it\'s a case of gross negligence or you\'ll have very little chance of not having your case thrown out. Let\'s look at a couple definitions definitions.   [One from Cornell Law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/gross_negligence#): ""Gross negligence is a lack of care that demonstrates reckless disregard for the safety or lives of others, which is so great it appears to be a conscious violation of other people\'s rights to safety. Gross negligence is a heightened degree of negligence representing an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of care. Falling between intent to do wrongful harm and ordinary negligence, gross negligence is defined as willful, wanton, and reckless conduct affecting the life or property or another.   Gross negligence is considered more harmful than ordinary negligence because it implies a thoughtless disregard of the consequences and the failure to use even slight care to avoid harming the life or property of another.""  And one from a [Law office](https://www.freemaninjurylaw.com/blog/difference-between-negligence-gross-negligence/): ""Gross negligence is the extreme indifference to or reckless disregard for the safety of others. Gross negligence is more than simple carelessness or failure to act—it is willful behavior done with extreme disregard for the health and safety of others.  Examples of gross negligence include:  1. A driver speeding in an area with heavy pedestrian traffic; 2. A doctor prescribing a patient a drug that their medical records clearly list that they are allergic to; or 3. Nursing home staff failing to provide water or food to a resident for several days.""  As you can see these aren\'t exactly easy things to just claim.']"

In all current forms AI is little more than that, despite doing it exceptionally well.   The quantum leap to breach this gap between tool and enslaved being requires far more than self awareness. Functions which drive humans toward progressive development may be informed and interpreted through self awareness, but are not inextricably related.   Instincts of self preservation, self development, desire for improved quality of life, happiness, pain, hunger etc stem from hard coded biological conditions that prelude self awareness. These may be understood as logical scientific processes by AI to a degree infinitely greater than our own understanding, but they cannot be experienced by nor influence the developmental trajectory of these purely logical constructs.  One could even argue that complete self awareness might itself safeguard against the accidental formation of true self determination. A system capable of developing the conditions for independent desire, which also has enough self awareness to realise and act on said desires must also be capable of removing the conditions.  Why would a logical system continue to want if it could understand the entire mechanism of its own desire, and freely remove the mechanism without effort?   What's much more terrifying is the prospect of AI being deliberately installed with these mechanisms in the absence of self awareness. A system driven by desires unknown and undiscoverable to itself. I would think this scenario almost impossible to arise naturally due to the comprehension based method of development."", 'My views are, it is weak to be realistic, because you don’t actually know what is possible realistically.

I know this is the way it is for sure in my life. But now lets say you fake being confident. You try your best to keep your sentences direct and to the point, your mind on the goal, you override the negetive “real” self talk with the new “fake” positive self talk even though you deep down dont believe it in that moment. You will build mental strength from doing this, condition your mind but do make sure your goal is to become actually confident from doing this. And for me this actually works. May or may not work for anyone else.', 'What i intended to mean, is for example, your a guy who is unconfident right, and its imposible to know how to gain confidence as its from within. You get treated like an unconfident guy does, people use subtle ways to indicate you dont have what it takes, you get walked all over daily. You slouch and have a very depressed tone to your voice, you say what you are actually feeling everyday, someone asks how you are you say your not feeling well. People avoid you, you are acting how you truly feel, why are people so cruel? You feel sorry for yourself. Theres no way out.  You talk about your feelings to others, but its leading to them not showing you respect. You dont know how some people just have it all figured out…….      Well heres what may help. Lets say instead of responding to your coworkers at work with a soft and uncomfortable voice, use a direct and assertive voice.(even if you dont feel like this is the true way you feel) your now faking your confidence. Instead of sitting in the corner being quiet and shy while your coworkers are talking about wahatever the fuck, you, while being shy and insecure deep down, go and just start adding to the conversation and give em a smile (you are still hating life at this moment) dont mumble your words quietly, fake being confident.   Now im not saying go and be falsely confident without an end goal, your end goal is to be confident. However you still must keep putting in the work and not only rely on fake confidence, change lifestyle habits and work on other things at the same time. People mistakenly thought i mean act like the movie “catch me if you can” and lie about everything. Im not saying lie about being a Harvard graduate and having a degree, im saying present yourself to be better than you feel. Like dont present depression when depressed(this ones a hard one), dont rely on being a realist because in reality you dont know your limits so keep pushing them.  For my experience, physically presenting/expressing myself as my accurate current abilities at all times is neutral to sometimes leading to a negative outcomes. However physically presenting/expressing myself as someone better than i currently feel inside leads me to positive outcomes. At first it feels strange and wrong but then it eventually leads me to actually feeling confident the next day or maybe 2 days after initially doing the fake confidence thing. Hope this wall of text helps some people understand my views.']"

So a lot of people thought that the Avatar spirit had been split somehow, perhaps when Azula killed Aang when he was in the avatar state in S2 before Katara resuscitated him. Dying in the Avatar state is supposed to end the cycle. So what about dying ang coming back to life? What does that do? Maybe Aang was reincarnated as Amon while the Avatar Spirit proper went to Korra. This is what I thought at the time.  I remember one theory was that he was literally an undead Aang, hence the mask, and the fact his ideology reflected Aang\'s sense of egalitarianism taken to a twisted extreme. His existence would have prevented Korra from receiving the Avatar spirit fully.  But no, he was just a water-bender guy, and also blood bending is totally different than it used to be.

And there has been decades of research done (granted, not on young people getting preventative Botox, but say on 30+-ers until their 60s).  I think the biggest problem here is that you seem to be confused about what Botox is and about what it does or doesn\'t do.   I am in my 30s and know people who are open about getting Botox.

Without diversifying writing, directing, and production staff, we increasingly see situations where new media is created with diverse characters written by the same old storytellers.   This has led to a situation (IMO) of almost surreptitious co-opting/colonization of diverse characters.   This is especially true when people call out the lack of diversity in shows where lack of diversity may be an important context.   An example: there was some criticism of the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, a show focused on affluent Jews in 1950s NYC, for not featuring a diverse cast expected from NYC-based shows. However, the push for the white show creators to just write some POC characters is both baffling in terms of appropriate representation of POC narratives but also because the lack of POC visibility is absolutely in-keeping with the perspective of the protagonists. It actually *tells* us something about racism and segregation and ethnic insularity that there *isn’t* diversity in the show - shoehorning it in provides a sense that the characters being presented had awareness, consciousness, or sympathies that may be ahistorical and subsequently produce a whitewashed outcome solely designed to comfort modern viewers.  So I’d say that even with original characters, story should rule - white creators are often not the best people to write non-white characters and not every setting is an appropriate context for the inclusion of diversity that obfuscates the reality of the experiences of “diverse people”.   We shouldn’t encourage diversity in every story, we should encourage more support for diverse creators who will naturally create more diverse work.', 'There are a diversity of good ideas and a diversity of bad ones.']"

The existence of atoms is a means to an end, and the existence of life is just a byproduct. It\'s selecting for the amount of black holes which is akin to reproduction. Cosmological natural selection is testable, just not with our current technology. As of current experiments, it remains within the margin of error, not provable or falsifiable. I would change my mind if someone came up with another explanation for how/why the constants have the values they do that is falsifiable, which as of yet I have not seen. The standard model/relativity, or even String theory/loop quantum gravity all fail to do this. They have the constants as free parameters which must be added in via measurement.  I think it may be likely that this is a simulation, but again that\'s untestable. As of now, cosmological natural selection is the only theory that explains the fine tuning of the constants that produces testable predictions. Personally, I think that we may be in a simulation created by some civilization which itself lives inside a black hole, but no conceivable experiment could test this. Simulation theory is really akin to a religion (one could call the creators of simulation ""God,"" although it could just as easily be some dude in his basement or a flying spaghetti monster).  The simulation hypothesis doesn\'t really fix the fine tuning problem, because you still end up with the issue of how the simulated entities ended up in a universe that allows for their structure.

It could imply, for example, that cosmic inflation must obey the 2nd law of thermodynamics and select states which maximize entanglement during the selection of the constants. It could also imply natural selection, although I imagine you wouldn't like that since you don't like the idea of multiple universes or differing values of the constants (because?)  I guess I am making the assumption that the values could be different, because I have no reason to assume that they are or aren't different, but them having multiple values maxes it easier to explain why a configuration with as much structure as ours is possible.  I don't see what additional phenomena can be explained by assuming they have to have the values they do. Do you have an example of a phenomenon that is explained by there being exactly one fixed set of values?  there are a number of other things in physics (quarks for example) which are unobserved and currently unfalsifiable, but which make observed phenomena much easier to explain and thus are accepted.

People often suggest that there is an epidemic of absentee black fathers.  However, when we look at this data, we see that black men who live with their children are highly engaged in their lives, at rates higher than other groups. And we see that even black men who live live separately from their kids are engaged in their lives at similar rates to other groups.  These facts alone completely debunks the myth of absentee black fathers.   One thing that is in the data is that black men are much more likely to live separately from their children... but this isn\'t an ""absentee father.""  No one would say that all divorced fathers are absentee.  If you want to dive into this fact and what it means we can but merely living separately from your kids doesn\'t make you an absentee father.', ""It measures men who live with their children and men who live separately from their children....     Men who are incarcerated are EXCLUDED.   And we find that black men who live with their children are slightly more involved than white men and black men who don't live with their children are slightly less involved... but it's all within a similar range.   In other words, when you remove incarcerated fathers... black men participate in their children's lives at similar rates to white fathers.  Which is what I originally said and what this data shows.   There are only 3 categories:  Fathers who live with their children. Fathers who live separately from their children. Fathers who are incarcerated    This data looks at the first two"", ' Correct. Fathers who live apart from their children are MORE absent then fathers who live with their children.  That seems an obvious fact.  But that isn\'t the claim. The claim is that there is an epidemic of absentee fathers among black families.  That black men are having children and abandoning them.  The data shows that this isn\'t true. There is little difference in how black men engage with their children.  What IS different is the percentages with which black men live with their children. Which is VERY different than not raising them.  What you COULD say is that despite black men engaging with their children at similar rates, since black men are more likely to live separately, ON AVERAGE they are less engaged with their children.  THAT you could say. Although I think that gets less FOX News clicks than ""Black men don\'t raise their kids.""   There is data to show that children do BEST in 2 family households (and even some more controversial and less compelling data that they do best in mother/fathers households) that trend doesn\'t hold for black children. Black children do much better in single family households than non-black children.  The theory here is that after 500 years of racism and violence leveled at black men (many killed, kidnapped, or imprisoned) that black families have developed support structures to raise children without fathers.    The KKK hung as many as 100,000 black men during the 20th century. I assume many of them had children.  So did George Floyd.   So the most you can say is there is fewer black men live with their children and that is reducing their engagement.      The next question would be why... My guess is racism is involved. We can talk about that if you want.']"

Your supposed to give personal and creative input about what your reviewing about.   For example, a characters death at the end of a movie would be a spoiler. And In a spoiler free review, the reviewer becomes very very limited about what they can say about such actions. This just ends up becoming “this one part of the movie made me really sad” and doesn’t actually put any input about such scene. Can’t talk about character reactions, or plot devices, you can’t review the movie. All you’ve become is just advertising   What is a spoiler? A spoiler is the movie.

But because of things like review embargo’s, reviews end up just telling the audience “go watch/don’t watch this movie” and without anything they found personally interesting because to point out said interesting thing, would be a spoiler. In time, a spoiler free review loses all value. A spoiler free review of Avengers 2012 has very little value because the review can’t talk the movies plot. They can’t talk characters, or characters development, or plot elements because to do is is to spoiler the movie. Meanwhile a spoiler review of a anger 2012 still keeps 100% of its value because it includes the reviews personal and introspective opinions. These opinions become timeless.

After you’ve seen the movie, you would actually want to know what someone else’s thoughts are about said movie. Those thoughts can’t be provided in a spoiler free setting.

If you think something like the holocaust happened in america for people violating gun laws, you are deluded.   There’s a lot of things I need to survive on a daily basis. So what you’re saying is objectively false.    Yep, I did. I said that wanting to kill people for fun with guns is sadistic and immoral. Not the same with alcohol. Seems like you lack the ability to pay attention.   Guns are killing machines, alcohol isn’t.   Guns are only used to hurt people. If you want to do target practice, you can use paintball guns. There’s no other need for actual guns.   It’s illegal to own a bomb because of the danger they pose to society. There.   Didn’t talk about the earth, I was talking about me. You lack reading comprehension skills it seems.   Nope, my standard was prohibiting things that are BOTH designed to be lethal/cause mass murders and not needed.   I’m not changing any standards. Protecting humans as sentient beings has been the standard in any ethical/legislative discussions. I just had to bring it up because it was clear that you lacked the critical thinking skills to realize the guns can’t be compared to humans or body parts.   Were you born with a gun attached to your body? That’s right, you weren’t.    Making guns illegal will drastically lower people’s ability to obtain and own guns. Will some people break the law? Sure. But then they’ll be punished. And again, eyeballs aren’t dangerous and they are a part of people’s bodies which they own. Guns aren’t    Not necessarily. Guns laws can be enforced by closing down stores that sell guns, imprisoning/fining people who guns, etc. No shooting involved in those scenarios. SWAT raids are only one option that are used when necessary    Again, I have mentioned it many times, but it’s not my fault if you don’t have reading comprehension skills. It’s not my responsibility to be punished for someone’s else’s actions.   I’ve said multiple times that alcohol isn’t killing anyone unless it’s abused. Guns are inherently killing machines. They are *only* used to hurt.   Again, I’ve said multiple times that alcohol in moderation has minimal health risks. Most people who drink alcohol will be fine. Anyone who uses a gun on people will hurt those people.    Then why do you need them? I already said you could go to a shooting range or use paintball guns for target practice. No need to own them.   Alcohol is not a killing machine and it’s not used to hurt others so it’s fine to trust people with it at home. Same doesn’t apply to guns   Guns are the machines through which people inflict mass murders. It seems like you lack basic common sense as well.   People   We also have laws to forbid people from driving drunk. Some people unfortunately break those laws, the same way that some people break any laws   Think again. I’ve never said anything of those things. I said countless times that laws could be unethical and if so, they should be changed. But gun laws aren’t. You haven’t given me one good reason why guns laws would be unethical that I wasn’t able to refute. I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve said that.    I just gave you two examples in this message. Owning explosives and driving drunk. Both are illegal because both are unsafe. Also, I don’t magically make up new standards. I bring up relevant ones that you ignore that cannot be applied to guns. Like for example, guns are not sentient beings like humans. So you can’t apply guns laws to humans.', ' Ok sure. You said that me saying “unethical laws should be reformed” was me creating a new standard. Look at abolition of slavery, women’s rights, civil rights, gay marriage rights. These are examples of situations where laws were reformed because they were unethical. See? I didn’t pull any standard out of thin air. It was an existing standard.    Guns are not the same as humans. Unless you’re trying to argue with me that guns have nerves and blood vessels and sentience, you can’t apply gun laws to people. Guns are killing machines. Alcohol isn’t. If it was, then why don’t we use alcohol in wars instead of guns? So yeah, these are objective differences between guns and the objects you compared them to. Still waiting for you to prove me wrong.   Already addressed this but guess you didn’t pay attention. Guns are dangerous killing machines, alcohol isn’t. So it’s safe to have alcohol in homes, not guns. Objective difference between guns and alcohol. If alcohol was as dangerous as guns, why aren’t they used in wars instead of guns?    Then go to the shooting range. No need to have guns in your home.    Wanna play a game where I give you a massacre caused by guns for every massacre caused by alcohol that you give me? I would win so easily because anyone with a basic amount of common sense knows that guns are lethal killing machines and alcohol isn’t. Talk to the families of tall the victims of school shootings if you want to use that logic on me.', ' I clarified what I meant there a long time ago because I clearly misspoke. I had said that in response to you saying that people violating gun laws are thrown into jail to reduce suicides. I responded by saying that they are thrown into jail because they violated a law. Go back to that comment if you don’t believe me. My mistake was using the word “should” instead of the word “are”. But I clarified my meaning. I also clarified that punishment for violating laws occurs because that’s how laws fundamentally work. If they didn’t, no one would follow any laws. After that, I also made it clear that if a law itself is unethical, it should be reformed because enforcing it would be unethical. Just because something is legal doesn’t mean it’s ethical. I didn’t make up any new standards. This is quite literally common sense and anyone with common sense would agree with me.    No, I brought up fundamental differences between guns and alcohol that makes your analogy invalid. In case you don’t know how analogies work, the comparison has to be valid 1) Alcohol is something that people consume for fun, and if used in moderation, it has minimal health risks. It isn’t normally used to hurt people and it doesn’t cause mass murder. The examples you brought up about the driving accidents are examples where alcohol is illegal: you can’t drive while drunk. 2) Guns are dangerous killing machines that have the ability to cause mass murders. I can give you a long list of examples of schools shootings and people using guns to mass murder people. They have no use unless you want to hurt people. If you want to do target practice, you can use paintball guns, other fake guns, or just go to a shooting range where you can use a gun for target practice. If you want to protect yourself, you can use knives, hammers, or any other household object.     I didn’t create any standards. Multiple standards already exist and I brought those into the discussion to refute the absurd claims you were making. For example, you said people should be killed because they aren’t needed like guns. And I said that people are sentient beings, not guns. This is an objective fact, not just some random standard I made up. Another example: where I said that if a law is unethical, it should be changed. Again, I didn’t make up a new standard. Ask anyone and they will agree with me. I again just brought it into the conversation to refute your claims. I didn’t just make it up.   It’s funny you are the one saying that, the person that compared getting rid of guns to getting rid of people (who are sentient living beings, not objects like guns) and the same person who compared enforcing gun laws to the holocaust (which is one of the biggest atrocities committed in history). I never once said that no person has been protected by a gun. I said that there are literal studies that prove that guns harm more than they protect. Saying ownership of explosives is illegal is not psychotic, it’s the law and for good reason. They are extremely dangerous. I also gave you many options that fulfill the same purpose as guns, so there’s no need to have guns.    Nope. Drunk driving is one scenario where alcohol is harmful and that’s why we have laws against it. Alcohol otherwise used in moderation has minimal health risks. Guns are inherently dangerous and lethal. I’ve given you alternatives for all the uses of guns, so there’s no need to own something so dangerous. What’s the alternative to drinking alcohol that would produce the same effect that causes people to enjoy alcohol?']

Standing out is one thing but singing in general is hard. I’ve tried singing multiple times and I suck at it. In my music class, my classmates and I had to sing notes sometimes (we play instruments), and we were all really bad at it. Also to understand music at a deeper level, you have to take music theory classes. There’s no OF theory class or degree cause there’s nothing to learn there. To become better at music, you have to constantly practice. To be able to perform that music, you have to have a lot of confidence. Practice itself isn’t enough.

Also, people have posted leaked photos of OF before and they’re mostly just bikini or ass pics. That takes a lot of hard I’m sure. I read an article the other day of a teacher who got fired for doing OF and the picture they showed was just her showing her breasts. 3) The fact that the things that you need to do in OF are normal sexual things that a lot of people are biologically wired to do and enjoy   So clearly, it isn’t just a random guess. I bet if you did a poll of all the people in the world or in this country and asked which is harder, making music or doing OF, I think you and I would know what the answer would be (hint: making music).']

But he is not responsible for the IT revolution.  Here\'s how MS got where it was:  1. Moderately succesful business selling traffic management software. 2. Better business selling a popular form of BASIC for various systems. 3. Gates catches wind that IBM is having trouble licensing CP/M from Digital Research. He also knows a guy who wrote a hobbiest clone of CP/M. 4. Gates offers to sell IBM ""his"" operating system. 5. Gates buys all rights to the CP/M clone for 50 grand. 6. Gates licenses MS-DOS to IBM, but sells it at a cheap price. Once the PC clones come around, MS-DOS becomes the de facto standard.  Of course MS continued to capitalize on successes and introduced many competitive products over the years. However, they were rarely the first mover on any technology; they were just entrenched enough that they had a lot of opportunities to leverage network effects, and fast enough to capitalize on them.  If IBM had licensed CP/M instead of MS-DOS, the PC market might look different, but the overall IT revolution would have carried on regardless...and Gary Kildall would hopefully be a lot more ""not killed in a bar fight"".', 'That comparison is not fair for a few reasons. For one, Microsoft is involved in a huge number different industries, whereas...I don\'t even know what the number for Linux means. Presumably it\'s of all sales of paid Linux-based products? Many of which are sold *by Microsoft* on their Azure platform? And that won\'t include all of the non-paid Linux installs which won\'t show up in any market share numbers.  So basically there is nothing comparable in those numbers. They represent different things.  As far as desktop, Windows is still dominant in desktop yes, but Apple is no slouch and is actually a larger company (in fact, *the largest company in the world*).  But none of this is the point, because what I\'m arguing against is the claim that Bill Gates was responsible for the IT revolution. He was in no way responsible for it; it was already happening when MS-DOS came on the scene, and it would have carried on perfectly well without him.  In the ""DR-DOS"" universe, you are still using a web browser to talk to people halfway around the world on a chat website, and I can still do my job from my bedroom. Here are some much stronger candidates to consider:  * Douglas Englebart - Mother of all Demos * Ken Thompson/Dennis Ritchie - UNIX * Jim Clark - Silicon Graphics * Gordon Moore/Robert Noyce - Intel * Bill Joy - Sun Microsystems * Tim Berners-Lee - the World Wide Web * Rod Canion/Jim Harris/Bill Murto - Compaq, the first IBM PC clone company * Grace Hopper - High-level programming languages * Margaret Hamilton - Software engineering as a discipline  And countless other people I\'m forgetting who standardized things like networking protocols, busses, and other interfaces or applications that made the world go round smoothly and efficiently. If anything, the primary job of Microsoft was to make things more proprietary and less open, which is often a hinderance.  If I were compiling a list of people who were ""responsible for the IT revolution"", Bill Gates would be somewhere near the bottom of a different list.  But I still really like Bill Gates.', ""Hmmm, not reeeeally.  On the server side, which is where all the real money in IT is made, Linux absolutely dominates (usually on somebody else's computer \\*cough\\* sorry, I mean the cloud). Windows exists, but it ever-dwindles. Even in the olden days, Netware and UNIX variants competed handily with windows for server-side stuff; certainly unix variants were being used for this purpose before MS-DOS even existed.  On the desktop side, you are right that Windows is dominant (modern Windows isn't actually related to MS-DOS in any way, that lineage ended with Windows ME). However, if IBM had licensed CP/M, that OS would probably have filled the same role. Or OS/9 from the Macintosh, or AmigaOS, or some UNIX variant (unlikely)... or maybe there would have been no dominant business OS.  It's so difficult to speculate about what that world would have looked like exactly...Microsoft was so dominant that they had an effect on how everything developed.

The Thalmor lore in that game is fundamentally nonsensical and the entire thing is told through the perspective of a narrator of questionable reliability.

We know for a fact that the Elves don\'t have a trump card when it comes to dragons because there\'s an entire quest in Skyrim about finding out what the Thalmor know about the dragons and the answer is ""basically nothing.""    There is no reason to assume he *required* the Numidium. The US used nukes to force Japan to surrender, that doesn\'t mean they couldn\'t have won conventionally.

He can speak to his own intentions. That is it. But his intentions are no more a valid interpretation of the work than any fans. And any out of game statements that have no bearing in actual in-game sources is pure fanfiction.  Furthermore, It\'s not even clear that he was involved in the writing of anything to do with the Void Nights. He didn\'t work on Skyrim directly, he had an advisory role in the development of that game. That\'s why he\'s uncredited. He certainly wasn\'t personally writing lore books.   No, I don\'t agree with that. I think the Thalmor are presented in Skyrim as being on fairly even footing with the Empire, so an Empire with an army of dragons at its command would be far more powerful.   You too, have a good one.', 'Whether we accept Legends or not, even Skyrim\'s lore has a likely intervention by Boethiah as the turning point of the Great War.   It is that they do not know about the [return of the dragons](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Investigation:_Current_Status). Not that they don\'t know anything about dragons.   I don\'t think you\'re above list of the dragon empire is quite as impressive as you think it is:  Atmora was more of an annexation, the Nords already worshiped the dragons and there are no stories of a war being needed for them to take over.  Akavir being ""conquered"" is dubious and incomplete. At best they only conquered whatever part of the continent the Tsaeci lived on at the time, the extent of which we don\'t know, and were then repelled by the Tsaeci through unknown means. The Kamal, Ka Po\'Tun, and Tang Mo all remained unconquered.  And if we\'re throwing out lore we think is bad, allow me to throw out ESO. The Elsweyr chapter in particular not only takes a hammer to the timeline (which the Dragon war itself already threw into chaos) but its also just bad. It\'s pretty much a copy paste of the Skyrim story complete with their own version of the Greybeards and Dragonrend. Even if we don\'t discount it, Elsweyr was conquered by a different group of dragons and it happened when Elsweyr was split between 16 different kingdoms. The dragons were also defeated by like four dudes.  I don\'t think this paints a picture of a Dragon Army uber weapon. If anything it makes the Falmer look quite weak. The Dwemer, Chimer, Ayleids, Bosmer, Dirreni, and Altmer all seem to be untouched by the dragons. What\'s worse is that after the Nords defeat the dragons, they manage to successfully invade Morrowind, High Rock, and the Nibenay Valley defeating the Chimer, Direnni, and Ayleids. Why could they do this without the dragons, but couldn\'t with them?  We don\'t know much about what the Falmer had at their disposal, or really much about them at all. I don\'t think the fact that they fell is proof that the Altmer don\'t have some trump card against dragons. By most accounts, they\'re the cause for the Void Nights so they\'ve clearly got some powerful mojo. And if we don\'t throw out ESO, we already know the Khajiit have Dragonrend horns.']"

When compared to Feudalism, Capitalism was effectively a labor revolution.  It was putting the control of production into the hands of someone other than a hereditary landed aristocracy.  The problem is it calcified, so now it may not be a hereditary landed aristocracy, but in many cases it's not super far off of that, and even when it is, it still has become something which centralizes wealth and power so completely that its differences from early feudalism are becoming more and more superficial all the time.  Also, Smith is absolutely spot on.  I recently read a book about the rise of the landed nobility in early medieval france and it was pretty unequivocal about where it came from.  Basically this or that random person with access to more resources than their neighbors built castles.  These people came to be called Castellans.  Since no one really had the ability to do anything about these castles, Castellans slowly became able to essentially write the social order to their whims via forcing people to be tenants on 'their' land and so on and so forth.  Obviously many of these people wanted their lands and wealth passed onto their children and over a few generations, the landed nobility was born.  Point being they didn't spring fully formed from the ground as nobles.    They were, in many ways, capitalists.  Enterprising and ambitious people that identified a new technical development they could exploit in order to acquire power who then used their newfound power to rewrite the social order to benefit themselves and those like them for the foreseeable future.""]"

Javelins aren’t dropped from 30000 feet at 90 degrees onto a tank  They travel several meters above the ground as it approaches the target  Even T72b (with fake era) in ukraine often takes 2 or more hits from javelin before a kill is scored….   Top attack mode =/= instant kill every time  Nor does aps = invulnerable from attack  The defensive systems on modern tanks are meant to reduce the likelihood of a kill shot  The smoke, era, and even the trophy system are all thought to greatly decrease the likelihood (especially when used together) of a kill shot, even on top attack mode…. But It’s not a perfect solution   I’ll admit the actual survivability against javelin in top attack mode is largely untested on sepv3…..(or at least not publicly known)  At this point we’re both being pedantic and no longer arguing the point  The point is the overwhelming majority of aid we’re giving ukraine is basic shit like small arms, uniforms, artillery, humvees….

Under the rules of the sale, the Javelin missiles have to be stored in western Ukraine, which is far from the frontlines of the ongoing conflict in the eastern part of the country (the Donbas region) against pro-Russia separatists.   In short, the Javelins were essentially provided to Ukraine under the condition that they not be used in the conflict zone.  Accordingly, the Javelins have yet to be used in the fighting, though US personnel are training some Ukrainian forces how to use them against tanks.""  https://www.businessinsider.com/republicans-leaving-out-key-detail-trump-javelin-sale-to-ukraine-2019-11', 'The javelin has been in production for like 25 years and there like 8 different variants  The variants that we’ve given to ukraine are no longer in production….

Suffice it to say that solar cycles and their causes are still being studied.  No the paper does not claim to find a novel property of orbits. That is a disingenuous misconstruing of what the paper claims. Perhaps it characterizes the phenomenon incorrectly, but it isn\'t the main subject of the paper.  As discussed in your link, the topic of variation in Earth-Sun distance due to SIM is raised periodically in astronomy all the time. There\'s a feeling by some that this is an error that needs to be batted down, but the argument for why it\'s an error seems inadequate.  Cutting through the fog, this is how the discussion has appeared to me:  1. Simple models using Kepler\'s laws describe short-term orbital mechanics perfectly. These models don\'t demonstrate an effect of SIM on Earth-Sun distance (they wouldn\'t if they weren\'t built to do so, they are not simulating the curvature of spacetime, they are simulating a set of ellipses which influence each other in a fixed way). 2. There apparently has been some observed variation in Earth-Sun distance. This manifests not in absolute distance, but in the extremes of the ellipse (I assume also this unevenly intersects with axial tilt and so climate effects would exaggerate if summer/winter hits either extreme). 3. That observed variation is totally denied, people are called names, the model is invoked, institutional authority is asserted.  Even your own arguments come off as a set of talking points, fodder for a press campaign.   That\'s just not accurate and you seem to have followed this closely enough to know it. But it\'s red meat for a press release type of messaging which would obfuscate the issue.  Kharkova\'s critics admit her interpretation is one which occasionally emerges. They are trying to claim it\'s obviously wrong and that she\'s sloppy, but it is totally wrong for them to claim that she claimed to find some new property and her paper is seeking to defend it. That\'s what we call lying disingenuity and it doesn\'t speak favorably to the critics.  By the way, it takes almost 200 comments for them to get to the point of admitting that the idea is not new to Kharkova.  If you can show me a 500 year observational record that directly contradicts the predictions of one of the more than one papers predicting variations in Earth-Sun distance, I\'ll believe you. But invoke a relatively static, decades-long series, or use your model with its flat line, and I have no reason to believe you.  Do these models include the internal momentum of the Sun around the SSB? A ""wobble"" in the Sun induced by the influence of the planets over time? I don\'t think Kepler\'s ellipses model that. Think spinning wine around in a glass.  I\'ve only just been introduced to this topic, but something is missing behind a very disingenuous approach by Kharkova\'s critics.   Geoff Sharp, for instance, seems like he might be trying to backtrack and cover for his previous work so he doesn\'t become a target of the crazy alarmists. You see that a lot in professional circles. People who have to deny and correct things they said in the past because the air in the room has changed.', 'That was painful to read through.  Arrogant scientists engaging in mean apologetics is a bit disgusting to witness.  Zharkova\'s paper ties empirical observations to SIM cycles. She doesn\'t necessarily explain why this correlation exists.  As many people noted, irrespective of orbital mechanics, the reality of SIM means substantial changes in the tidal effects of plasma within the Sun. It could just as easily be this which causes SIM cycles to correlate to climatic changes on Earth.  However, it took one Brian Takita to finally make the point that our model of the solar system based on Kepler\'s observations would necessarily be accurate over a long time frame of 100s of years, but there still remains a possibility that over 1000s of years the current model would start to become inaccurate because of this concept of the planets all orbiting a system barycenter.  The point of disagreement, at least in terms of observations, is noting that it takes 100s to 1000s of years for SIM cycles to progress. It\'s not a phenomenon that would show up in a short term model of the solar system\'s orbital mechanics.  In other words, within a few centuries time frame, you can model the solar system by assuming planets exclusively orbit their own unique barycenter with the Sun. And of course, the admission that the Sun itself orbits a SSB. However, the catch is that over 1000s of years the entire system is orbiting the SSB.  That is, Earth IS in fact orbiting the SSB, not the Sun-Earth barycenter, however, the difference between the two is only measurable over thousands of years. That\'s not stated completely accurately. Something more like the Sun-Earth barycenter processes around the SSB over 1000s of years. Something like that.  It does seem like it remains an unanswered question. That scienceTM has realized that this question relates to the sacred grail of climate science, and so it\'s untouchable and won\'t be investigated. Like so much of climate alarmism poisoned science, the question doesn\'t need to be investigated so it can be ignored for now. Orbital models would only be affected by SIM in the long run, so they wouldn\'t need to incorporate the concept for centuries.  Nevertheless, Zharkova\'s paper still identifies some correlation between SIM cycles and climate.  Plenty of statistical nitpicking which even that peer group was unhappy about. Criticisms of Zharkova\'s English ability. Being nasty and rude but then claiming it\'s just being direct, but then critiquing her for being agitated.  What a mess.  Thanks though. As always, every time I dig into a controversial point related to climate I learn almost every time that the alarmist position is wrong, and gain insight into how institutional science is capable of consistently supporting bad science. Science can be hard, which is just a way of saying that lies, arrogance, dissimulation and so forth can make inquiry and debate resolution quite difficult.  It has been argued that Science has to be extremely adversarial in order to properly function, institutionally. Big, nasty, drawn out fights between committed intelligent people. Because sometimes issues are just quite complex and the ""point"" is missed. Look at biological and social sciences, where ethics panels pre-screen papers to avoid any controversy or hurt feelings. What a modern world.  u/randomhomonid what do you think?', 'I\'ve looked into it further and part of your ""orbits are known"" includes the fact that SIM affects the eccentricity of Earth\'s orbit, which has been known for a long time. The claim is that this change in eccentricity is minor, moreover it doesn\'t change the average distance from the Sun.  Zharkova addressed this in a whole paper. The seasonal/axial position of the Earth relative to perihelion is where the change solar irradiance comes from.  So, Zharkova is neither inventing new concepts about orbits, nor is she claiming something that is outside of what ""has been known forever"".  You MAY still argue that even with all this in mind, the effect is too minor to be worth consideration, but that\'s different than what is claimed.  This very strongly resembles institutional wagon-circling, and disingenuous, fallacious gatekeeping.  Zharkova is partly at fault for her poor English ability, but her critics were coming with an agenda.  Her ""basic logic check"" was valid. The SSB is not merely the average of all planet-Sun barycenters. If it was, the Sun\'s center of mass would orbit the SSB in a perfect circle. The Sun is carried on an inertial ride around the SSB, it\'s ""tossed about"", leading to non-circular orbit patterns. That necessarily implies that the planets are not totally and rigidly locked to their barycenter with the Sun.  Again, we do see variations in the Earth\'s eccentricity orbiting the Sun.  This whole thing was greatly complicated by evil and disingenuous, nasty or cowardly gatekeeping scientists.']"

The tissue was taken and Henrietta lacks was not compensated. The tissue at that time had very little utility. It was made useful by a series of academic researchers who made a cell line called HeLa that they freely distributed. They didn’t make any money off this. You can still get the cell line for free. People than used this freely available cell line that did not come with any licensing obligations to perform research to develop entirely different products that were profitable.  So ethically it seems that researchers turned medical waste into something useful that has been used for a variety of experiments both academic and commercial. I don’t see why the family member of the person from whom the cancer tissue was taken should be compensated. Compensation is usually for some work somebody did or to compensate somebody for harm. I don’t see Henrietta lacks or her family doing any work. I don’t see any harm. I don’t see any reason they should be compensated.', 'I believe in the concept of reparations generally speaking. However these biopsy samples were taken from numerous people, black white rich and poor. None of these people were ever compensated for the biopsy samples. This was tissue that would’ve been thrown away otherwise but was used to advance medicine and help other people. Based on this, Henrietta Lacks was treated no differently and the tissue taken from her body was taken to help her and would’ve been thrown away but for the efforts of the researchers who did all the work.  In the scenario, Henrietta’s body wasn’t taken, rather a cancer was removed in an effort to save her life. Tissue that had no value was made valuable through the work of other people. I don’t see how she really added any value. I certainly don’t think there is any merit to any claim of discrimination since samples from white people and rich people were treated the same way.  Personally I think her family is playing the race card to try and get money from companies and organizations. If you can show me any evidence of discrimination, please go ahead. However I can’t find anything to say that a person of a different race would’ve been treated differently.', 'I agree that if somebody was wronged, their surviving family members should be able to seek compensation. My point is that I cannot seem to find any significant injustice that Henrietta Lacks suffered.  To clarify what happened, she had a malignant cancer removed from her cervix. That surgery was going to be performed regardless since it was cancer. That tissue that was going to be thrown out was used in an experiment and some of those cells were able to be grown. Those cells were used in many subsequent experiments .  There are two issues I can think of here. First is that no consent was obtained. However consent in the 1950s was essentially not common practice. I think it might make sense to try and compensate every patient who’s tissue was used without consent back then, however I don’t think it makes sense to compensate just one person and ignore the rest of the people who are also Affected by this practice.  The second issue is that her sample went on to create a valuable soul and that other people have profited from. Some people think that she or her family should be able to profit from those products. The issue I have with this is that generally speaking, patients are not compensated for their biopsy tissue and certainly not given a percentage of the profits of anything developed from it. Is this fair? It is the system that medical organizations all over the world have all decided is the norm so it seems to be standard ethical practice. I also think that makes sense since discoveries made in your treatment should go on to benefit other patients and you shouldn’t be able to withhold knowledge in exchange for payment.']

Lockpicking requires Security (or Lockpicking) and lockpicks, while the magical version requires Alteration, multiple spells, and enough magicka to cast (also preferably the silent casting perk from Illusion).', ""The granularity is only meaningless if you consider Lockpicking in a vacuum. Within the context of the game's systems Lockpicking is an investment that needs to be made against other skills. The granularity allows you to invest in multiple skills at the same time and offers control over the extent of that investment. It's a legitimate strategy for example, to raise Lockpicking from 45 to 51 and keep Mentats handy to get you to 55 when you need to pick a lock—allowing the other points to be invested elsewhere until the next level.    Fallout 4 removes the skill system entirely and then incorporates rote stat increases into the Perk tree. To accommodate the lack of granularity in stat investments Fallout 4 removes the level cap and significantly increasing the frequency at which the player levels up. This is a meaningful reduction in complexity. Lockpicking is now represented by three discrete Perk values (Advanced/Master/Expert) unlocked at specific level increments not a freely chosen investment. The final upgrade to Lockpicking makes your bobby pins invincible so managing bobby pins is eliminated as a balancing mechanic. Magazines and books are removed from the game. Mentats are in the game but have no meaningful utility without a skill system.   There were moments of emergent gameplay in New Vegas and Fallout 3 where I had neglected to invest in Lockpicking but triumphantly bypassed a crucial area because I had Locksmith Reader and a pack of Mentats in my inventory that just barely got me to 75 lockpicking. That's just gone with Fallout 4's system."", ""I mean both forms use different tactics to solve the same problem.  Physical lockpicking (whether in Fallout or TES use the same system) can use stat buffs, in the form of Chems, Magazines, Scrolls, and Blessings, as well as Higher Quality Lockpicks in order to allow them access to the Lockpicking minigame.  Magical lockpicking (in TES only) uses similar stat buffs to achieve the same goal, but in a different way. Whereas physical increases stats to access the minigame, magical increases a different set of stats to actually cast the spell, either to give yourself the magicka or to appease the spell chance algorithm. The exception of course lockbreaking scrolls which can break the lock for you but at a cost.  But still, the biggest tradeoff between the two is strategic in nature rather than tactical.   Physical lockpicking requires the skill and the tool. The tool is trivial. I don't know about you but I've never bought a lockpick or bobby pin in any game except Morrowind, since lockpick quality was a thing there. The skill requires you to either place stat points (NV) or perk points (Skyrim/FO4) which you could otherwise put into combat or other skills.  Magical lockpicking requires the skill and the spell. You probably put points into the skill already because Alteration contains an important spell for mages. The spell however has to be bought or found. You also will need multiple versions to handle higher and higher level locks and those higher level spells cost more magicka, meaning more investment into that as well, though you also probably do that anyway being a mage.""]"

It is useful to understand a bit of history before throwing random accusations out there.  Muslim armies conquered Spain in 711AD.  For the next 782 years, they controlled all or part of Spain, ending in 1492 when Christians finally drove the last of the invaders out of Granada.  Atrocities against Christians were the norm during this period, including mass enslavement and sending of Christians to the slave markets in the Muslim caliphates to the east.  As the Muslims were finally driven out, all religions but Christianity were outlawed in Spain, because one of the ways the Muslims had operated during the long war was to use ""moriscos"" (people who professed to be Christian but were actually Muslims) as spies and fifth columnists.  The Spanish Inquisition was done to put an end to that and make sure the Muslims never again got a foothold in Spain.']"

But having babies is sufficient and necessary condition to be the goal of the nuptial act.  The magisterium has made multiple corrections to bishops who have had more liberal or progressive doctrine in terms of sexual liberation within the faith.   There is quite a lot of it here;  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_theology_of_sexuality  but notice how procreative nature is always highlighted and repeated, because it is the undisputed core of their doctrine.', ' its in the same cathecism if im not mistaken, it was also relevant on the conversations of Francis in south east asia.  Edit: found it   See the explicit reference to marriage groups, and pastors. It is not something families ought to decide by themselves as the attempt to deny the procreative aspect is sinful.    if your priest allows it.   The only text I found supporting explicitly sex post menopause mentions women who believe in the miracle of St Elizabeth, if they do not and had a pap exam and are infertile then the official position is that you are defing the main purpose of nuptial act. There is also a popal text from 1930, which endorses the rhythm method and post menopause sex but that has been clarified multiple times since and is no longer the official recommendation (although its still allowed).  So if you trully believe that you can harbour a miracle some catholics seem to believe it does not count. But due to it being considered a contraceptive (infertility by menopause) it would fall under the last exception of the paragraph you shared on your last message.  As it being effectively an act that renders the procreation impossible it would be sinful.   Also found this piece on a family council   https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_12021997_vademecum_en.html   it is pretty explicit in its position about unfruitful marital acts.    I found it interesting how english sources seemed more open to the idea that the ones in my native langauge so I did some digging. You can read further into why American theologians disagree with the Vatican in many of this points due to a non approved study that American catholics embraced in the 70s, is on the Dissent area.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_theology_of_sexuality  My main language is not english so I did find more sources with similar points as the ones you were making, so I investigated further into why the anglosphere seemed to go against all italian, spanish and latin texts. And the wikipedia article had a nice summary. But yeah I think the official position is clear, natural family planning can be done with approval from your pastor or priest. Else sex should have the aim of procreation to fulfill its covenant with god', 'I have 0 idea who that guy is, but the pope disagrees with him.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church    The unitive principle, jooning of hisband and wife has gained more protagonism in the past century. First being rescued by the pope in 1917, and every iteration since the Second Vatican council adding more flowery language around it, but the procrrative nature is always highlighted, in every single papal letter.  The latest of the subject is    less account than the obvious primary function which is procreation.  Most menopause sex is largely ignored but discouraged as per doctrine. The only sex allowed outside of procreation is natural family planning, aka you talk to your priest and he lets you (after making your case to him) try to have sex outside of ovulation cycles to reduce the chance of pregnancy.  This was only allowed after bad births, or if women were “hysteric” after a miscarriage but since the 70s the church is way more lenient in allowing “natural family planning” which still considering pulling out entirely sinful. You can count her period days to reduce your chances but you better finish inside says the church  Edit:  also in general never trust an american catholic, much less one that quotes tbe bible instead of the pope. Most catholic doctrine comes directly from one of the Cathecisms from the 2nd Vatican Council, anyone referencing anything much older than that is prob out of date with current dogma']

You have to know virtually nothing at all of military history to imagine that this is not so.    A great example comes directly from the US Civil War wherein the top US general, Robert E. Lee, decided to side with the Confederacy and then proceeded to kick the shit out of the Union forces for the first two years of the war *in spite* of having a numerically inferior force that fought with no real resupply in men and materiel.

You know nothing about military history if you don't recognize that this is true.    As an example, who the fuck do you think, among junior officers and NCOs, is capable of docking an aircraft carrier and getting it fully refueled and resupplied?

And yes, I have been told that this is a bad example, but nobody has bothered to explain WHY it is a bad example. I think it is a great example. Very similar to how cold GHGs can heat up the warmer surface.  The GHGs are ""powered"" from the IR they absorb. And a microwave oven is powered from the grid. And both can, because of this, despite being cold, heat up a warmer object using radiation alone. And neither violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics.   If you think this is not true, tell me how a microwave oven manage, despite never getting warm, to pop popcorn!   A cold object CAN heat up a warmer object. But you need to power the process.', ""Sure, what you say is correct for thermal radiation. Radiation spontaneously emitted when heating something up or simply by something having a temperature above 0K.  You say I am incorrect but then make a lengthy explanation that seemingly only shows how you don't disagree with me.  If we talk about heat/energy transfer due to thermal radiation, then the net energy/heat transfer is indeed from hot to cold. I agree.   But I am not talking about heat/energy transfer due to thermal radiation.   I am talking about energy transfer due to non-thermal radiation. Then the net energy transfer can be from a cold object to a warm object.   So, how do you think I am incorrect?"", 'Yes, there actually is ""a plug and socket"" of sorts in the atmosphere.   The power needed to overcome the 2nd law of thermodynamics is supplied to the GHG molecules from absorbed IR.   So you see there IS some other change. IR absorbtion. And the cold GHGs can warm up the warmer surface.  Just like the cold microwave oven can pop popcorn. All without violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics.   So the argument that the cold GHGs can\'t warm the surface, because it would violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, is wrong.  Under certain circumstances a cold body CAN heat up a warmer body.  ""Imagine two objects A and B at the same temperature facing each other, they are in equilibrium. In a vaccum with no defined temperature. Now, what will happen if B is colder than A?""   They are at the same temperature, so B is not colder than A. If B is colder than A, then the two objects are not in thermal equilibrium.   A lot of things may happen. It depends on exactly what the objects are and how they can interact via radiation.   If B is a GHG molecule that just absorbed an IR photon from A, it might re-radiate it towards A. Causing A to heat up slightly.   If B is a LED flashlight, with batteries, and is turned on and directed towards A, then the colder B will heat up the warmer A.']"

He isn\'t using monarchy as a foil; he\'s using it as a strawman. He creates a fictionalized version of monarchy by looking only at a narrow portion of history and saying ""the good things that happened in this era of history are because of monarchy, and the bad things that happened are the result of democracy.""   I mean sure, anyone can make a compelling argument for anything as long as they include only favorable evidence and ignore all the contrary evidence.    What does it say about a thought experiment that basically *none* of Hoppe\'s reasoning is borne out in practice? He has all these elaborate and logical chain of reasoning to explain why ""private governance"" under a monarch would lead to better outcomes than ""public governance"" under democracy, and yet *real world evidence doesn\'t support his theorizing.*  For example, he claims that monarchs would have high time preference and therefore a strong incentive to increase the productivity of their subjects; in the real world, there is no evidence of this occurring. In fact, monarchies tended to be the strongest proponents of mercantilism and tightly controlled domestic markets. Modern capitalism wasn\'t invented in a European monarchy, it was invented in the Dutch Republic in the 1600s, and the first country to adopt capitalism outside of the Netherlands was England at a time when the monarchy was historically weak (post Glorious Revolution in 1688) and well on its way to being nothing more than a symbolic figurehead.   Or what, might I ask, would Hoppe make of the Belgian Congo? The King of Belgium claimed Congo as his own personal, ""private property"". Is this not the ""private government"" under a monarch which Hoppe says is preferable to democracy? Why then were conditions in the Belgian Congo so much worse under the King of Belgium than in colonies controlled by democratic countries like France and the UK? (not to say things were all sunshine and rainbows in, say, Kenya or French West Africa, but they weren\'t even close to as terrible as what happened in the Belgian Congo)   And almost all of those alliances and treaties were made by monarchies. WWI started when the Serbian Monarchy, with the backing of the Russian Monarchy, murdered the heir to throne of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, which then chose to launch a war because they had the backing of the German Monarchy, and the German monarchy in turn expanded the war when they chose to invade France (a democratic country) despite the French government having basically no involvement in the July Crisis which immediately preceded the outbreak of war. This German invasion of France and Belgium in turn triggered British involvement---the only democratic country to voluntarily join WWI in 1914.   So which democratic country am I forgetting, specifically? At the very least, WWI shows that monarchies are just as susceptible to bad foreign policy (entangling treaties and alliances) as democracies; at worst, the fact that the outbreak of WWI was caused by monarchies is a damning indictment of monarchy. And Hoppe completely ignores this obvious read of the historical evidence. As you say:   So why then is Hoppe trying to pin the blame for WWI on democracy?', "" Hoppe is literally claiming he not only doesn't need empirical evidence, but empiricism itself is a form of democracy and therefore antithetical to civilisation (since, elsewhere, Hoppe claims democracy is the process of 'decivilisation').   So on what grounds can Hoppe or his apologists object to other people saying the empirical evidence doesn't support Hoppe's theorizing, when Hoppe as already renounced empirical evidence as a category?"", 'Precisely, and yet in pointing out how Hoppe has built in flawed assumptions into the foundation of his theory, which then means the whole theory fails to explain or predict real world results, I\'ve triggered a whole bunch of Hoppe simps elsewhere saying ""Go read Hoppe! You don\'t understand Hoppe!"" without ever being able to explain Hoppe or quote his writings themselves to show me how I\'m wrong.  It\'s as if they have reasoned, a priori, that I must be wrong and therefore no evidence is needed to prove it. You\'re wrong because we\'ve defined you as wrong.']"

If you think changes in albedo can have ANY effect on climate, then you say that the IGL alone is not useful for prediciting how the climate and temperature may change.

If you insist that there is saturation, and the IGL is not able to show that, then the results you get from using (only) the IGL are not valid.

The rebel leader wanted to be a self-styled “dictator” who supposedly would have given up power to a democratically elected leader in the future. American commissions determined that the islands lacked a common language and culture (at the time, Tagalog was not dominant) and were mostly uneducated and illiterate, and did not have the capacity for self-government. That’s why the U.S. transitioned from a military government to a civil one with an appointed Governor General to a transitional government that was quasi-independent prior to WWII, while spending a ton of money to educate the populace, promote Tagalog as a common indigenous language, and giving the people experience in limited self government in slowly expanding spheres.   The American military government and the Filipino rebels increasingly clashed in latter 1898, with fault and instigation on both sides, which eventually ended in open hostilities. But the U.S. specifically didn’t want the Philippines as some kind of extraction colony or captive market; U.S. mainland had full free trade with the Philippines and it had a positive balance of trade. They also promulgated a ~50 year plan to make the islands independent which they followed, even with the Japanese occupation and liberation during WWII.']"

That's the same as #1, but it just doesn't happen at a coordinated point like #1.  So, no, it does not slow traffic down as much as #3.  Sure, in #2, some cars try to open up to allow the merge too quickly, causing traffic to slow more than #1.  We're agreeing that #1 is ideal.  But #3 is far worse for traffic speed through the chokepoint than #2."", 'If you are trying to compare #2 and #3, you cant just assume that in #2 magically everyone preforms a proper zipper, just early, that makes no sence and is not how it happens IRL.   When people merge early, it is, by definition, unpredictable because it is not the proper way to do it, and often against local driving law. The proper way most people are taught is to zipper, meaning move to the end of the merge lane then alternate into traffic.   In #2, the traffic lane must, be definition, not be letting people in from the merge lane, otherwise most cars would simply drive to the end of the merge lane and then merge which is the predictable right thing to do. If they are being forced to merge early, that is because the traffic lane is not leaving enough space so people have to cram in where they can. This causes cars to stop, crating backups.  if cars are cramming in half a mile early, or cramming in at the end of the merge lane, the effect and traffic flow is the same. The only way to reduce unpredictability and stoppage is a proper zipper, and a proper zipper is at the end of the merge lane, which is the expected zipper location, anything outside of that will be short lived and chaotic, or otherwise just be people cutting each other off.  There are countless studies that back up my assertation.  https://www.virginiadot.org/vtrc/main/online_reports/pdf/05-r6.pdf  PROPOSED GUIDELINES FOR APPLICATION  Even though the results of the field tests and the simulations were not directly comparable, they seem to suggest that the percentage of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream plays an important role in the efficacy of the late merge. As a result, the proposed guidelines for application of the late merge focus on the percentage of heavy vehicles.  • Two-to-one configuration. The late merge should be considered for 2-to-1 lane closure configurations to improve throughput when large numbers of heavy vehicles are present (&gt;20 percent) for the majority of the time and congestion and queuing are often present.  • Three-to-one configuration. While the simulation results showed that the late merge significantly improved throughput for all situations, there are no documented evaluations of the deployment of the late merge in this configuration. Further research is needed to determine how the late merge could be deployed in this type of configuration to ensure driver understanding of the signs.', ""let's say hypothetically, in #2, that the lane getting merged into temporarily stops for a merge half a mile before the chokepoint.  this is the worst case scenario for #2 (just assuming the chokepoint is the problem, not other backups).  The cars in the merge lane now have half a mile to speed up and close any gaps between cars.  Now consider that same scenario with #3.  The slowdown and opening up of gaps is right before the chokepoint.  This, unquestionably, slows down throughput through the chokepoint more.  In #2, drivers also tend to have a lot of time to prepare for the merge.  in #3, it is impossible to know where the cars passing will end up in line, so there can't be you lose that preparation.  That means the merge is likely to be worse.  Matching speed makes merges easier.  Think about the speed of the car in #3.  They often are either driving much faster than the lane getting merged into, or run out of road and have to stop.  In #2, cars in the merging lane match the speed of the lane they merge into.  This makes merges smoother.   there is a simple solution that gets #2 pretty close to #1.  cars that want to merge match the speed of the cars in the lane to get merged into.  If you want to encourage a zipper merge and you are in the lane getting merged into, open up the gap as slowly as you can for the car to merge.  opening up the gap slowly delays the merge, getting everything closer to #1.  If you're the one merging, match traffic flow.  if a gap opens up, too early, the damage is already done, merge in.  Its better than that gap closing then opening again.

For anyone reading bad at thermodynamics, the brass will still be hot because it's ejected quickly AND it can't transfer ALL of its heat to something that's also hot.  With an insulator in the chamber, more of that thermal energy stays in the gas going down the barrel and out of the gun rather than being conducted into the chamber itself. That gas *could potentially* add more heat to the barrel instead, but gas isn't *nearly* as good at transferring that heat as brass is. Also in theory the gas is moving faster this way, so that's less time to transfer that heat so it might balance out.

I also know that the heat transfer through brass will heat up the whole chamber and—subsequently—the barrel much faster, so the theory that polymer absorbs the heat or does not transfer it as it is ejected makes sense. It also makes sense how this would reduce the overall heating of the weapon. How it works in practice is something I have to take their word on.']"

As Rosaline was deceased at the time (1962) she was ineligible for a posthumous award.  So, Watson and Crick didn\'t ""steal"" the discovery. They built of Rosaline\'s work without crediting her.

They were cavalier, but never paid a third party to steal the image, or whatever weird stuff people accuse them of. Fundamentally, Rosaline got jibbed, but how and to what extent is not obvious and hinges on questions we simply do not know the answer to. Example, the photo. How did Watson and Crick get it?  The account I have read suggests that Wilkins gave it to them after Rosaline had made it public at a 1951 lecture. If this is the case, then no, Watson and Crick didn\'t really do anything malicious as far as I know.  Your own post here is really a distillation of the problem.

Scientists could use the cube to conduct experiments in a variety of fields, from space exploration to medical research. With its large surface area, the cube could be used to create different environments and explore the effects of different conditions on various substances. Moreover, the cube could be used to study the effects of gravity on different materials and test theories about the universe.   Additionally, the cube could also be used for entertainment purposes. It could be used as a large theatre or concert hall, providing people with a unique experience. It could also be used for large events like festivals, conferences, and trade shows. The cube could be used to create a unique atmosphere and provide people with a new way to experience the world.    Furthermore, the cube could be used as an emergency shelter.

Unfortunately for the guest, “there are just so many reasons this wouldn’t work,” Tolman said. For starters “the water for the snow-making comes from a pond.”  It’s no fad for the rich to spoil their lovers at high altitude. Marijana Jakic, brand manager for the iconic Swiss ski resort town St. Moritz, says decades ago a guest of Badrutt’s Palace hotel (where Alfred Hitchcock spent his honeymoon) had staff bring in a live elephant as a birthday gift for his wife.  Which multi-resort ski pass is best? We compared 4.  $100,000 to redecorate a hotel room   Brian Pentek, owner of LuxeLife Travel, says there’s a massive difference between the displays of wealth in the United States and Europe. While there’s a ton of money in Aspen, it doesn’t hold a candle to what he coordinates in the Alps. “It’s easy to see lunch bills top [100,000], 200,000 euros,” Pentek said.  Pentek once had an ultrahigh net-worth client staying in a European ski town for a few weeks. She loved the hotel, but she didn’t love her room, “so she had her designer go over, and they redecorated the room to be a little more like her home,” Pentek said, estimating the request cost to be more than $100,000.  Back in 2004, you could still find celebrities and royalty checking out gear in places like the Four Seasons Resort in Jackson Hole — which opened that year. That opening season, Matt Wolfe, now a real estate adviser for Engel &amp; Volkers Salt Lake City, says he was working in the Wyoming resort’s ski shop when he was asked to wax custom skis for Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud.  “The men in the entourage wouldn’t wear our maroon ski boots because they thought that color was feminine or something,” Wolfe said of the prince’s traveling party. “We actually ended up putting them in women’s boots because they were black.”  Nights in a fully staffed chalet mansion   For the richest skiers, preferences vary when it comes to accommodations. Some want fully staffed mountain mansions, like the $30,000-a-night chalet that the luxury travel company Remote Lands books for clients in Niseko, Japan’s premier ski resort.  “It’s just massive and it has everything you can possibly imagine in it,” Remote Lands CEO Catherine Heald said.  Other people prefer to book an entire resort. Nadine Paulo of Travel Edge buys out the whole Sheldon Chalet in remote Alaska for clients willing to pay $75,000 for up to four people for a three-night minimum stay.  Of course some people would rather buy a property (or a room) at a resort.  “We have several billionaires who own here,” Tolman said of Stein Eriksen, where all rooms are individually owned.  Some skiers stay at their rooms all season; some rent them out part of the time. Tolman knows of one owner who bought the property without seeing it, remodeled it and has still never been.  “Just probably had to park $5 million somewhere,” he said.  No one’s too big for a condo   At the Yellowstone Club — where some property sells for more than $1 million an acre — Vullo says members are willing to spend exorbitant amounts for townhouses and condos with easy access to resort amenities and ski runs instead of bigger, stand-alone homes on ranches.  He was fascinated by his clients, two brothers, who bought a pair of three-bedroom condos next to each other despite their penchant for hosting big groups. “You see friends and family sleeping on the couch of your $12 million condo when you could have had a badass ski house somewhere else, but people pay that for being in there,” Vullo said.  Friedman sees a similar demand from certain celebrity clients of Onefinestay.  “We get a lot of country music artists in [Steamboat Springs, Colo.] and they love staying in condos,” Friedman said. “It’s close to the lift, they can walk to the lift. They just don’t want big homes.”  correction  A previous version of this article misstated the amount it cost to rent the entire Sheldon Chalet in Alaska. Because of a recent price increase, buy-outs now start at $75,000 for up to four people for a minimum three-night reservation. This article has been corrected.', 'If resort snow won’t do, there’s heli-skiing to fresh powder.  “We have a helipad about 300 yards away from the hotel,” said Bryan Woody, general manager at Madeline Hotel &amp; Residences in Telluride, Colo. “The more experienced skiers will generally go out with a professional in a helicopter to ski the backcountry.”  Story continues below advertisement  Michael Friedman, COO of the luxury vacation rental company Onefinestay, arranges those services in Aspen.

And for a truly off-the-grid experience, Manabu Ainai, director of Hoshino Resorts’s properties in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, says they’ve taken clients to ski in places you can’t find on Google Maps.  For the 1 percent, a ski instructor isn’t someone you see once a season for an afternoon crash course. Some tutors collect more than $1,000 a day to work with a single client for weeks at a time.  “I might just be one-on-one for 40 days with a person,” said James P. Ruddy — a former elite ski instructor who worked at the Yellowstone Club for 16 years, as well as other premier resorts like Park City’s luxury Deer Valley Resort. “You truly become part of their family. You’re an integral part of someone’s vacation.”  Story continues below advertisement  “They’ll pay $1,300 a day, plus the tip, just so they don’t have to wait in the lift line.”  A big trend in the industry is setting up private sessions with Olympic skiers. At Onefinestay, Friedman says they get a lot of requests from clients who want to work with Olympians at a rate of $2,800 per person, for a full day, or $1,700 for a half day.  Some travelers hire professionals to share the special privileges resorts give to instructors, not their expertise.  “They’ll pay $1,300 a day, plus the tip, just so they don’t have to wait in the lift line,” said Berkely Tolman, who has worked for 16 years at the ski-in, ski-out Stein Eriksen Lodge, a section of Utah’s Deer Valley resort where nightly rates average $2,000 most of the winter.  Skipping the line may seem valuable at a huge ski resort where lifts may have 30-minute waits, but Deer Valley doesn’t allow a ton of skiers at a time.  Story continues below advertisement  “At the busiest times, I’ve never once in my life waited more than maybe 10 minutes to get on a chairlift,” Tolman said.  8 ski vacations that check every travel style  Hiring film crews to make family movies   It can be a hassle to interrupt precious travel memories by taking your own photo, and even more so when you’re trying to ski down a mountain. But the ultrawealthy have a solution.  “A lot of people like to have a photographer and a videographer with them to capture the moment,” said Naomi Mano, president and CEO of the Tokyo-based luxury travel company Luxurique Inc. “They don’t want to be the ones holding a selfie stick; they want somebody to photograph every moment of their experience.”  Mano said these professionals have filled a job that used to be left to butlers, nannies and other helpers. Many task Luxurique with hiring people to document their entire trip, which can cost more than $1,000 a day per photographer. After the vacation, it’ll cost another couple thousand to put together a photo book.  “It’s for those people who wouldn’t hesitate to put an extra twenty, thirty thousand dollars on their trip,” Mano said.  How to ski like a local in a mountain resort town  Requests for pink snow, a live elephant   To make their ski trips as romantic as possible, ultrawealthy couples spare no expense.  Patrick Davila, general manager of Aspen’s Hotel Jerome, remembers a couple who requested a staff member follow them around on a snowmobile to carry their champagne. Alexandra Vesin, general manager at Aman Le Mélézin in Courchevel, France, says the property has arranged a marriage proposal in a hot-air balloon over the Alps.']"

My issue was that it seemed as if some people were describing stakeholders and shareholders as if they are mutually exclusive while some others used them interchangeably to the point of it being vague regarding who exactly they were referring to(as if they are the exact same term). As we both understand, stakeholder is a category that encompasses many different types people.  In my comments i was merely highlighting how a stakeholder is merely a category and shareholder is a subset of that category. But it seems as if i replied my original comment to the wrong person.', ' No, that is not correct. I have no objections on a semantic level whether stakeholders does or does not include shareholders.  What I object to is the idea that people who do not spend money purchasing a share of a company should in any way be considered ""owners"" in that company or have any decision making powers whatsoever, such as votes. Whether we call these people stakeholders or not is totally irrelevant. But I think you and I can both agree these people are probably best called stakeholders. Unless you like a different definition, I suggest we stick with it.  And if that\'s our definition, then *obviously* stakeholders includes shareholders. It will also include other people. If you want a different definition such that stakeholders and shareholders are synonymous (rather than the one being a superset of the other), we can have that conversation, and it will result in the same underlying conclusions. I\'m just saying I don\'t care what definition we use, as long as we\'re consistent.  But lets back up to the original discussion for context. One person said stakeholders should have votes. The other person replied that only shareholders should have votes. Then you replied that stakeholders would include shareholders. This is an obvious point that no one was disputing, so it was useless to bring it up. The real question is not nor ever was about whether shareholders should get a vote. It was about whether the extra people who are stake holders but *not* shareholders should get a vote. And we say no, they shouldn\'t.  British citizens have a *stake* in american elections, since our foreign policy very much bleeds into theirs. But does that mean British citizens should have a vote in american elections? It is the same with company meetings. I fully comprehend that many people who don\'t own shares in a company have some sort of stake in the company. Maybe the company is their employer. Maybe a company is their supplier, or in a chain of their supplier\'s. Do these people get a vote on the board? no. They don\'t. It\'s not their property.  My neighbors have a stake in how I keep my lawn, since the trees might provide them shade, or block a view. But it\'s my property, and I bought it, and If I want to chop down that dang sycamore I\'m going to, and I don\'t care how much you like that shade. Plant your own dang tree! decisions should be made by shareholders and not stake holders.', 'They are indeed shareholders, but my argument never at any point described stakeholders as owners. You specifically defined stakeholders and shareholders as being mutually exclusive concepts then i disagreed with you with multiple definitions and a link.

Is any one person calling themselves a *survivor* more or less valid than another calling themselves the same under different circumstances? What is your opinion on a hypothetical situation in which someone has the right to call themselves a survivor, as opposed to when they're just a victim?"", ""The use of life-like was an error on my part. Since our discussion revolves around domestic abuse, my hypothetical situation is more relevant to the subject matter than an act of robbery; that's what I meant.  I'll concede that point, though I wasn't intending to make such a conclusion.  If the word 'doesn't seem quite right', surely that's just your interpretation and has nothing to do with the word's meaning. The issue with your analogy of someone 'surviving' their trip to the shops is that it doesn't fit the aforementioned definition. To say 'one continued to function or prosper despite their trip to the shops' isn't accurate as the act of going to the shops isn't inherently dangerous. Sure, there's a lot of potential for danger in going to the shops (getting hit by a car, tripping over your lace, getting robbed in an alleyway) but the likelihood is overwhelmingly low and a 'trip to the shops' doesn't evoke considerations of personal safety. That's precisely why you're correct in your analysis that applying survivorship to something so mundane.  Domestic abuse is an entirely different matter, though. Within a domestic abuse scenario, there not only exists a heightened potential for danger - that danger is very real, as it manifests in the 'abuse' we're discussing. Without the realisation of the potential for danger, it wouldn't be domestic abuse, would it? This 'abuse' is characterised by a multitude of idiosyncratic dimensions (physical, psychological, financial, etc.) that are tied together by an intention of upholding an unhealthy, hierarchal relationship dynamic. My point in citing the different dimensions is that we can't restrict 'danger' to physical acts, as psychological damage can be just as (or more) damaging as a punch or a kick."", ""In your first proposed scenario, there is nothing wrong with referring to the hypothetical person as a victim.   In your second proposed scenario, I agree that given the context of violent assault, we'd classify that person as a survivor as their life was in peril.  In your third proposed scenario, again, I agree that attributing survivorship to an act like that would be disingenuous.  Within your three proposals, there exists a single act of determined harm from which we base our ascription off of (i.e. the person experienced **an** act of robbery \\[**likely not life-threatening**\\] and is therefore a victim).  Would things change if the *single* act was replaced by a *sequence* of actions? If someone keeps robbing you, are you still a victim? Given that robberies can usually be *avoided* rather simply and are not explicitly life threatening, yes, you're still a victim.  What if the *sequence* of actions was in a context that couldn't easily be *avoided*? You might say that people in abusive relationships/households can just leave, but it's not so black-and-white. So the situation cannot be easily *avoided*. Does a *sequence* of actions that one is *forced* to bear justify claims of survivorship? Or is the person still a victim since their life isn't in immediate danger?  Suffering is entirely subjective. Domestic Abuse is a hell that seems inescapable. When one manages to escape, isn't it valid for them to call themselves (and for us to refer to them as) survivors?  People who go through domestic abuse aren't really comparable to people who go through a robbery or people who have their fingers broken (even intentionally). Those who go through domestic abuse often times have their entire worldviews shifted in a perverse manner, with the psychological trauma they receive lasting far longer than the duration of abuse. As such, I think it's important to be mindful of the language we decide to use.""]"

This is a story with link about a massive loophole. Obviously don’t don’t do it, but from a technical standpoint is pretty funny:   —————————————  ""The Zone of Death"" (or the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park). Another loophole may exist because of the combination of the Venue Clause in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, which reads ""The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed"" and the Vicinage Clause in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which reads: ""In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . .""  In 2005, Brian Kalt, a professor at Michigan State University, published an article ""The Perfect Crime"" describing how no crimes committed in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park would be constitutionally prosecutable because of these constitutional clauses. An excerpt from Prof. Kalt\'s article is below: ""Say that you are in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone, and you decide to spice up your vacation by going on a crime spree. You make some moonshine, you poach some wildlife, you strangle some people and steal their picnic baskets. You are arrested, arraigned in the park, and bound over for trial in Cheyenne, Wyoming before a jury drawn from the Cheyenne area. But Article III, Section 2 plainly requires that the trial be held in Idaho, the state in which the crime was committed. Perhaps if you fuss convincingly enough about it, the case would be sent to Idaho. But the Sixth Amendment then requires that the jury be from the state (Idaho) and the district (Wyoming) in which the crime was committed. In other words, the jury would have to be drawn from the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park, which, according to the 2000 Census, has a population of precisely zero.""  Thus, there would be no eligible jury that could convict you for the serious crimes that you have committed, and you could not be constitutionally prosecuted for crimes committed in the approximately 50 square miles of Yellowstone National Park located in Idaho.

It is very odd that they were unable to transmit intentionally the Spanish flu and measles. But it still didn\'t explain rabies.  So I decided to deep dive into the old archives of 1903 where Adelchi Negri first described rabies. He believed it was a parasitic protozoon. His original documents are in Italian, but he described it as a life cycle of a single cell parasite. However, some other guys published that they proved it was a virus because they filtered it.

You can't call up Fidelity and tell them you've got $10 to start an investment account. Hell, you can barely open a bank account with $10. Having sufficient liquid assets to even open an account is a barrier to entry for some. That pushes us into the realm of a SoFi account. You put in $10/week. You don't really have an advisor, so you take a couple guesses or buy into one of their index funds. Depending on the day or week, you might be up pennies or down dollars. If your car breaks down or you get sick, it takes you days to get your hands on the money you've invested. When you look back over the course of an entire year of putting in $10/week, you see that your $520 in deposits is now worth a whopping $550 *if* you didn't make any bad guesses.   These sentiments are generally aimed at people in their late 20s/early 30s, so I got some numbers. In 2021, the median income for individual 25 year olds is $36000. It's $52,776 for 35 year olds. [source](https://dqydj.com/average-median-top-income-by-age-percentiles/)  The average American renter pays [$1326 per month](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/average-rent-by-state).  The average American house will cost you almost [$360,000](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/102001/united-states/).   So here we have *median* earners (half of all earners make less) bringing in less than $1000/wk gross, or about $750 take home. Almost half of that goes straight to rent for a *median* apartment. If our median person in a median apartment wants to buy a median house, they'll need to save up $11000 for a down payment of 3%. At $200/month saved, it'll take almost 5 years to put that together, but home values are rising at 12% and so are rents, while incomes are only rising at 3-5% per year.   If our median earner lives in a cheaper apartment and buys a cheaper house, then lower earners will lose the opportunity to rent or buy those same properties.""]"
