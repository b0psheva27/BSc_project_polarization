Why are you saying it's impossible when we literally do it for K-12?   Yeah, and? Taxes pay for K-12 as well. Your point?   So that they can send their kids to college without having to pay for it independently out of pocket. Instead it gets paid for through taxes. I suggest taxes on the rich, that way even middle class families won't have to pay a dime for it.  You know, people in this country used to work and fight for the next generation to have it better than they did. Free higher education would make it better for the future than we have it right now. Why do you fight so vehemently against a good thing?"", 'Yeah I really don’t care if you’re condescending or sarcastic. I mostly found it amusing you’re telling me to do more research and that I’m not listening, when you don’t understand the legal system as well as you think you do.   Let’s try this one more time. The 6th circuit case you keep citing was regarding one specific rally, in which Trump never uttered any phrases which could be construed as encouraging violence. He also mentioned to his crowd to not hurt the protestors. These two factors led the appellate court to strike down the lawsuit.   January 6th and other rallies are entirely different because he *did* utter phrases which can be construed as inciting violence. His usage of the term “peaceful” could very well be mitigating, but that’s for a jury to decide. The 6th circuit case in no way is precedent that he can’t or won’t be charged, as you keep saying.   If you want case law that is directly relevant to Jan. 6th, try this on for size. A federal judge earlier this year rejected Trump’s efforts to dismiss a lawsuit, saying the court believes Trumps speech that day was not necessarily protected by the first amendment, because it incited violence.   https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-lawsuits-donald-trump-48fef5775a0043339fb38aa84ad419be  That ruling is currently being appealed to the DC circuit, but there’s a gem in there as well. The Trump lawyer recently told one of the appellate judges that civil suites should be barred because it sets a bad precedent for future presidents, but admitted that “Trump could theoretically face criminal liability over the riots.” Which is another good point: there are legal differences in civil cases, like the one you keep citing, and criminal ones. But his own lawyer admitted he could face criminal liability.   Trumps other statements that day behind closed doors are highly relevant. In order to prove incitement, prosecutors need to show intent. If you listen to Trumps statements throughout the day, it can be dismissed as Trump being Trump. On the other hand, his actions behind closed doors add context to his state of mind, and you’re flat out wrong if you think they’re not relevant to a charge of incitement or conspiracy.   I honestly couldn’t care less about the house impeachment managers editing a video. Impeachment is a political process, not a criminal one. And if that video was shown in criminal court, you don’t seem to understand how exculpatory evidence works anyways. The Brady rule only requires that the government hand over evidence that could show a defendants innocence, not that they themselves have to show it in court.  If Trump is ever indicted on incitement and/or conspiracy charges, prosecutors can use videos of his statements that day without mentioning his peaceful claim. Maybe they would to preempt the defenses argument, but prosecutors don’t play the role of defense attorneys…  I’m well aware that people are fanatical in their wish to see Trump go to prison. But it’s up to DOJ, not two people on Reddit who don’t have law degrees.', "" Please make your argument. How did the author define a healthy marriage. What characteristics? What are your reasons to believe that women seeking abortions and their sex partners share those characteristics?  I need a citation that in the referenced studies that the parents who were married wanted to be married to each other. It is your claim, so you can define what that means? Wanted to be married on the day they were married? 50 years of uninterrupted marital bliss? Whatever it is, please provide your citation that in the studies that demonstrated that children of married bioparents do better that the bioparents wanted to be married.    You mean all other things being equal. Actually, I am getting confused by your argument. Are you arguing that the children of a single woman who got married and got a marriage payment would not be better off if she got married and didn't get the marriage payment. Or are you arguing that the children of the woman would be better off if she got the payments even if she was married?   Sorry, typo. I meant to say: You seem to think single parents can't just go marry the other parent.    Because the data show this is less than ideal for the average child. If I am going to make these levels of changes to society, I really want to aim for the best possible situation.    I mean, how often do you think that happens? Laws don't exist to make sure that every possible thing in your life is already laid out for you, including everything that is highly unlikely to happen. People have to live their own lives. If some rare exceptional thing happens, you may be faced with rare exceptional choices. But for the hundreds of millions of other people, the law can provide some practical, broad support.    I don't want to incentivize gestation. I want all parties to get what they want. PL - no abortions. PC - more choices. Society - more and better citizens.  Society is not satisfied with women gestating and then abandoning children in garbage cans.    What are you talking about? Can you show me any US state marriage law that requires people certify they love each other? Are you serious with this?   Look, if you want to look for creative solutions, you cannot have such an inside the box attitude.    I think you will not get society on board. Paying women to give birth but having no expectations on what happens to the child after that. Perhaps all the claims of PCs about PLs not caring what happens to kids once they are born is just projection.    This is just discrimination. You can hire the best person for a job. The data show married bioparents are the best parents for kids.    Except marriage ties together two people's financial situations. The man is incentivized to marry the woman, as they now both have claims to the payments.    I already said either way. Are you in with no abortion restrictions? It seems like no.    Good thing this never happens, even if everyone is trying to get there.    The problem with this suggestion is why should I do it? Tell me why I should give money to a woman just because she gave birth. That seems like a horrible idea. Women would literally give birth, get the check, and throw the baby in the trash and get pregnant again. I am not paying for that.    Tell you what. If you want this, lets go to the mods and ask for a rule that anything that happens after birth is off limits on this sub. No more PCs saying that PLs don't care what happens after birth, because it is not about abortion and banned. Or is this a silly thing to say? I hope my point is getting clearer.""]"

I also have a sex like that."", 'Yes, I’m sure some were. This post might have been made and worded to be directly about my experiences on reddit, but they’ve happened outside of it too  Who cares? I\'m still waiting for evidence that you were insulted on this sub ""just for being a woman"". And if it happened outside of this sub, then why is it relevant to you leaving this sub?        ""It wasn’t a competition""  People say that but talking about problems as ""women\'s"" or ""men\'s"" issues inherently makes it a competition. That\'s not a problem specifically with ""you"", I\'m just saying that\'s how this whole debate works if we\'re being honest.  ""Yes, although it may not be in the titles it’s definitely in the comments. They’re displayed so vague sometimes""  Yes some comments aren\'t really the most accepting towards women... but how does that relate to YOU specifically? And it doesn\'t change the fact that MOST comments are okay and direct their anger towards feminists. Something you clearly also resent.        ""Even if it is rare, it still happens and it makes my blood boil when I see it""  But it\'s not even directed at you. And I also think you\'re blowing this supposed ""misogyny"" way out of proportion. The truly misogynistic comments here are almost always downvoted. So why would these comments bother you? If they got tons of support, I\'d get your outrage. But this doesn\'t happen.  ""18\\* I see where you’re coming from. It’s difficult to take someone seriously when they’re probably in a completely different age group than you are""  It\'s not that I don\'t take you seriously because you\'re 18. It\'s that you are still so young and haven\'t taisted what the real world is truly like. To form such strong opinions at your age is not particularly wise.  No joke, at your age I barely knew what ""sexism"" meant. I also didn\'t really know what ""feminism"" meant. And I think that\'s a good thing, regardless of how weird that sounds. Because what that means is that I went through my teenage years not being exposed to this awful topic and I never was brainwashed by excessive social media feminist pandering, unlike people (especially girls) from your generation. You\'ve grown up in a time where being a ""feminist"" is considered the default (at least publicly). I have seen young women become extremely radicalized over the last ten years. This is stuff that you couldn\'t possibly comprehend. I\'m talking about a time when you could barely even read.  Trust me, in ten years, you will cringe at the opinions and prejudices you have now... and you will realize just how ignorant you truly were. And that\'s not a personal attack, it\'s true for everyone. But I do take issue with lack of self-awareness. Everyone is oblivious at your age. EVERYONE. So was I. Still am to some degree I suppose. But I didn\'t freaking pretend otherwise either. I didn\'t act like I had the world figured out. Meanwhile, you talk about history &amp; feminism as if you\'re an expert. Don\'t lie to me &amp; yourself, we both know very well that you have never seriously researched feminism &amp; its literature. Your understanding of feminism is extremely superficial.  ""it’s something that affects me and other women on the daily""  Yeah... now multiply that by a billion and then you know what men are going through. Women are simply not being demonized 24/7 by men, least of all by the media, academia, entertainment &amp; education or politics. That objectively does not happen whatsoever. There has literally been research on this (admittedly, I don\'t remember the exact source). But it showed that ""men"" as a group are talked about in a negative light the majority of the time in the media. No such bias exists against women.  Don\'t tell me you know what it feels like to open the internet &amp; see a dozen ""kill all women"" posts. Don\'t tell me you know what it feels like to watch TV &amp; hear something along the lines of ""women are trash"". Don\'t tell me you know what it\'s like to listen to the radio and for some guest to appear and talk about how privileged women are and how they are responsible for all of human suffering. Women are NOT demonized en masse. Sorry.        “How do they perceive me?” “Do they think I’m not capable?” “If I mess up they’ll think it’s because I’m a woman.”  What are you even talking about??? I don\'t know any man who genuinely believes this.        ""I suffer with anxiety""  Evidently. Precisely why I told you to delete all social media.  ""It affects the way I play video games. I waited until I was 18 to change my gamertag so people wouldn’t shit on me for being a woman when I die""  I\'m sorry but if this is the extent of your ""oppression"" in life, I can\'t take that seriously &amp; all you proved is how privileged you truly are. If you can\'t handle generic video game trash-talk, then mute the chat or don\'t use a mic. 99% of online gamers don\'t use a mic. Those times have passed. You were literally 5 years old when the peak of trash-talking happened (CoD MW2). And that was overwhelmingly (young) guys shitting on other guys.  ""Sounds dumb, but it’s genuinely a thing""  It IS dumb and I couldn\'t care less even if it was a ""thing"". Literally no one is going to ""shit on you"" in an online game if you die. No one has the time to look at your gamertag and follow the leaderbord during a game. That\'s just silly. They might harass you if you talk with the mic, but again, if that bothers you, don\'t use the mic.        ""You probably don’t take it all too seriously because I’m young, but these problems are just as valid to me as they would be to someone in their mid 30’s""  I was circumcized as a young boy because men don\'t have genital integrity rights anywhere in the world. That\'s a REAL fucking issue. You\'re goddamn right I don\'t take you seriously if you\'re going to whine about something so petty as ""potential online harassment"". Btw, Pew Research shows that men face more online abuse anyway. It\'s not a ""female"" issue.        ""Yes, I don’t have all the answers to the original concept of feminism. No one really does""  No one? It\'s not hard to educate yourself on its history.  ""But I can assure that when women wanted jobs, to go to school, to vote, it wasn’t their intention for those horrible things to happen to men""  Wtf are you even talking about? Women have ALWAYS WORKED. This is what I mean when I say your generation has been brainwashed by feminism. Women have always went to schools. There are records of female voters dating back 400 years. You could say there were barriers, but feminism has deliberately ignored the reasons as to WHY those barriers existed in the first place. Fundamentally, it had absolutely nothing to do with ""oppressing women"". Also, all men got the vote a meager TEN years before the suffragettes got the vote. And this is interpreted by feminists as men ""always having all the rights for thousands of years"". This is SUCH a joke.  And it\'s not true to say it ""wasn\'t their intention"". It was EXPLICITLY their intention, as they were more than happy to enforce &amp; perpetuate it.        ""If all that was normalized then, I think women would’ve been drafted""  Bullshit. Anyone in any relevant position who\'s pushed for women\'s inclusion in the draft has always been immediately blocked, to this very day.  ""But it wasn’t normalized, hence why women had no part in it. Nowadays we see women participating in going to war because their opportunities have grown.""  For fuck\'s sake... there is a very big difference between being ""allowed"" to go to war, and being FORCED to. I don\'t give a shit if a very minute % of women ""want to fight"". What I care about is that MILLIONS OF MEN were FORCED to. If war breaks out in Europe with all the fuckery going on right now, I will be drafted &amp; there\'s nothing I can do about it.        ""It’s not about equality at this point, it’s equity. Both genders have different needs that need be met in different ways.""  Right.... can you even name me one legitimate female issue? I\'ve asked several women this question and NOT ONE has been able to give me an answer that wasn\'t complete bullshit.', "" I don't disagree. But none of the progress we've made has included men.     Sure. But what is the world's foremost gender advocacy doing currently aside from working towards the interests of that same group?     They would if we included men in the first place.      I mean. Why do you think they haven't?      I feel I am being realistic. The number one movement in the way is feminism. Because men cannot suffer under feminist paradigms. We are only ever oppressors. We have all the rights, all the power. Everything good happens to men and everything bad happens to women because of men.   This is currently the paradigm society is working under.   This is feminism.   I do not see feminism in any way as a movement against gender inequality. As such I do not think movements for gender equality would be nonexistent without feminism.""]"

Likewise, if someone you met *was* a Christian Anarchist, they wouldn\'t necessarily tell you, because a lot of Anarchists have the same attitude as you toward them, and they\'re likely sick of defending themselves repeatedly. Same with other minority Anarchist positions. They\'re not necessarily going to reveal this, if they\'re sick of answering the same questions again and again.

There are a lot of single-flavor Anarchists who want their favorite specific Anarchist system to be the only one. I mostly see this with AnComs, but I\'ve seen other Anarchists do it too. Anarchists are not exempt from petty infighting about which Anarchist system is ""reaaaaally"" Anarchist. Meta-Anarchism is, currently, a fringe position within Anarchism. Related things like Anarchism-without-adjectives are also trying to cut through the infighting, but when you get down to brass tacks with some of them, they also have a favorite Anarchist flavor that they hope is ""the"" outcome of revolution, as though there can be only a single system that results.         Eh. Political action is organized on the basis of political ideology, and political ideology comes from the juxtaposition of idealized systems (political philosophy, including that of Anarchists) and reality. So an Anarchist essayist composing a work outlining a new flavor of Anarchism (say, meta-anarchism) is contributing to Anarchism in a different way.      I find it funny that many of us will reference Marx, who only wrote and spoke about his ideas, then turn around and call any Anarchist thinker who isn\'t going out and doing Anarchist praxis an ""armchair Anarchist."" There\'s no such thing as an ""armchair Anarchist,"" besides perhaps someone who secretly believes in Anarchism, but never tells anyone anywhere, and does nothing on this basis, even private, individual praxis. If you do absolutely anything with Anarchism, including just telling people you are, then you are doing Anarchism, because that builds awareness of Anarchism, the ideology. One person who tells each of their friends or coworkers or whoever about Anarchism might create three people going out and doing other Anarchist praxis who otherwise might never have arrived at that.', ""This is half correct. Anarchy and communism are not the same thing, after all, it's the reason we call it anarchist communism or anarcho-communism, however, *What Is Communist Anarchism?* exists as a single book about both anarchy and communism.

With the tx22 I can reasonably shoot with almost any grip even utilizing poor stance and technique while expecting decent results. The same can not be said for the 9mm.   If you utilized the 22 only for training this would lead to poor habits in technique that are masked by the low recoil and ease of use. Then when you transition to a firearm that you do not shoot often because of your training crutch you are going to experience far more misses and potential issues like losing control of your firearm. I have seen folks transition to larger calibers that expect the same results and let the recoil wildly throw the firearm around. If you do that in a defensive situation where you are going to fire multiple shots in succession you are going to let rounds fly that you have no idea where they are going to impact. These rounds may end up in your neighbors or loved ones. If you aren’t using 22 defensively then you should leave firearms like that to plinking or casual shooting only.  The correct procedure for the OP should be to visit a gun range with an instructor and rent several firearms to determine which size, weight, and configuration they are comfortable with then take some classes to develop the correct technique and increase confidence behind the trigger. Then to continue to drill and train on their own while periodically taking further education on practical shooting. Ideally taking part in events such as IDPA or USPSA so they can understand dynamic shooting as opposed to static shooting in a controlled environment. Having a firearm should not be a light decision where you buy a plinking pistol and shoot it once in a while and consider yourself proficient enough for a defensive situation where you have shot your primary firearm little to none. We have a responsibility to those around us as well as our loved ones so we shouldn’t allow poor training or concepts to potentially make the situation worse.']"

Paleoclimatology allows scientists to determine temperatures and atmospheric conditions from 500+ million years ago, which helps draw conclusions about modern climate behavior.  In the 70s, only [a third of research papers were claiming there would be cooling](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/89/9/2008bams2370_1.xml), and the ones that did argued that it would be because of the cooling effect of aerosol/CFC emissions. Even the cooling papers acknowledged that CO2 causes warming, they just believed aerosol emissions would outpace CO2 emissions. These aerosol emissions were banned under the Montreal protocol in the 80s, thus no more cooling.   We know modern warming isn’t caused by cycles because natural climate cycles tend to happen on 100,000 year time scales. [NASA can explain this better than I can.](https://climate.nasa.gov/ask-nasa-climate/2949/why-milankovitch-orbital-cycles-cant-explain-earths-current-warming/)  The empirical evidence that makes global warming more than a theory is plentiful: We have satellite measurements showing decreased outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere, real world data that our emissions are trapping heat. We know that this CO2 was emitted by us because it has a chemical signature associated with burning fossil fuels. Natural influences on the climate are thoroughly studied and factors like changes in solar output and volcanic impacts have had little measured effect on climate in the past couple centuries.

Trans people who transition medically in some form are roughly .5% of the population in wealthy western countries, maybe less.    That\'s rare enough that unless you have a large social circle you might not know any of us.

Or athletes?     I know some older trans people.  And yeah, they are mostly trans women.  I suspect the numbers are scewed by biology.  A trans person who realizes they are trans in their 30\'s or 40\'s is likely to have young children, and it is socially even less acceptable for mothers to leave or break up the family than it is for fathers.  So more older trans people are women because more trans men said ""screw it"" and lived their lives as women.  Trans women were usually the breadwinner, they had the money, trans men were more likely to be a housewife, comparably trapped.      I have met trans men.  Most of them are quietly living their lives.  That\'s another reason I think most older trans people are women, most trans people that are visibly trans are trans women.  We have a harder time passing, and it gets harder still with age.  Trans men struggle to pass with baby face early in their transition and that goes away with time.  Older trans men don\'t need the queer groups and support groups as much because they are less visibly trans and don\'t experience as much transphobia.  With hormones they become big bearded guys that are just slightly shorter than average.    We are people.  That means some of us have shitty ideas and some are criminals, and .5% of everybody is still millions.  Just because your child is, statistically, almost certainly cis, doesn\'t mean *they* are not trans.  If your child gives no indication they are trans you can comfortably assume they aren\'t.  But if they say they are, the odds are much, much higher.    There are 25 million children in the US.  .5% of that is 1.25 million but most of us didn\'t know as children so half that to 600 thousand.  That\'s still half a million families with a trans child that knows they are trans.  Hormone replacement therapy is dangerous to **cis people.** For  trans people it\'s *healthcare.* Just like if I took blood pressure medication, I could die or be hospitalized, but for someone with high blood pressure, it\'s just part of their treatment.

So although drag shows can exist that have been censored and made suitable for children, this is not the case, the examples I\'ve posted refute this.  - On the topic of drag and drag shows not being inherently or commonly sexual, there is evidence that sexual undertones are a pervasive and key element of drag:  The below are extracts from two articles that are PRO drag, describing drag without an an anti-drag agenda.

So, u/-HypocrisyFighter-, do you see your own hypocrisy on this? If you actually believe what you\'re saying, then you shouldn\'t support the Electoral College.   As for this new argument, it\'s basically circular. We\'re a constitutional republic, and a constitutional republic needs to have this convoluted electoral college system, so therefore we need the electoral college. Right? But in addition to being a circular argument, that\'s not even true about constitutional republics. A republic is essentially just a kind of representative democracy. So a ""constitutional republic"" is just a representative democracy that\'s bound by a constitution. So why exactly couldn\'t we have a representative democracy where everyone gets an equal vote for president? What is inconsistent about that? It\'s actually pretty simple. France, for example, is a constitutional republic with a president who is elected in a popular vote.   And again, it\'s worth remembering the original purpose of the Electoral College. It has nothing to do with any of the arguments you\'ve made here. The point was that the Founders didn\'t trust people to vote for president. They thought people would be too dumb and ill-informed. So instead, each state would send a few local political elites to join this temporary political body that would then choose the president. Of course, we\'ve essentially abandoned that system -- and for good reason! Each state lets people vote for president, and it\'s mostly irrelevant that they\'re technically just voting for a slate of electors that then picks the president. The electors don\'t really get to exercise any independent judgment. But then that eliminates the entire original purpose of the Electoral College. We end up with this system that usually (but not always) reflects the will of the voters.   Since we don\'t even have the system the Founders originally intended, why not just replace the Electoral College with an actual popular vote? That way the candidate with fewer votes doesn\'t weirdly become president some of the time.', "" I've explained this 8 times now- people vote and don't vote based on the electoral college- this is how the electoral college being the deciding factor changes the popular vote in a way that isn't representative of the american people.

That seems to go right past you.  Read the above again.  Since the Constitution and BoR are well after the revolution, wen the FF fathers write militia into the Constitution, etc.,  they don't want standing armies and put the State/Feds in charge of a militia they know won't work well in an invasion.  But no one wants the expense and are suspicious of standing military in peacetime.   The South was worried about their militia being disarmed and not being able to keep down slave rebellions.     And once again, THE MILITIA WRITTEN INTO THE CONSTITUTION IS THE ONLY MILITIA RECOGNIZED BY THE FED AND STATE.  The other civilian militias you think hearken back to the old days are not anything recognized by the Constitution, so you cannot point to the Constitution to support their existence.  You mix arguments supporting Constitutional militia by the founders along with frontier defense units against Indians, etc.  So when an argument for militia is deployed to support the ratification of the Constitution it is supporting the Constitutional militia FED/STATE concept.  Denials by you mean nothing.  The only vestige of the Constitutional militia left are the words - relics from a day gone by, and the National Guard.       The militia groups around today do not hearken back to the early militia.  The early militia were there to deal with a very real problem and there is no problem today, just an imaginary one.   The are pretenders, unless they are doing reenacters, and that is pretending too.  I'm still waiting for you to explain how we've been under tyranny for the past 100 years."", ""It's literally the first amendment to the US Constitution."", 'The collective rights claim started in the 1870s, by judges who wanted to deny people of their rights. It was strongly taken up by progressives, as a way to deny people of rights they did not want them to exercise. It was also rejected by Miller, Heller, McDonald, Bruen, and Caetano.   The founding fathers never talk about collective rights. It’s not mentioned in our founding documents. What they did talk about, repeatedly, and what is recognized in our founding documents, are individual rights. Our country is founded on the concept of individual rights.   Even with the argument that 2A only applied to militia service, you’re talking about an individual right, because militia members are expected to supply their own arms; thus they must individually have the right to possess arms. Furthermore, 2A protects a right to keep, meaning own, arms. It doesn’t protect a right to bear community held arms in militia service. Personal ownership is an individual right.   Those who hold a collective rights position on 2A are those who want to deny rights. The writings of the founding fathers and the ratifying debates are very clear that it is an individual right that all Americans have.  As far as 2A being a right that is intended to allow the people to resist tyranny: it was mentioned in the oral arguments for Bruen. It was also noted, in the McDonald case, that 2A was enumerated to allow the people to resist a tyrannical government.   The Heller ruling specifically notes that 2A was enumerated because the founding fathers feared the government would disarm the people, and this would allow a standing army to rule. In other words, it was enumerated to allow the people to resist tyranny. Heller further notes that, although this purpose is written in the prefatory clause as a reason for the right, it is not the only purpose for the right. Notice, it did not say that this was not a purpose for the right; just that it was not the *only* purpose for it.  What did the heller ruling say?  1. 2A protects an individual right, not a collective right  2. 2A did not just protect those arms useful for a militia, but all arms commonly used at the time; meaning it doesn’t just protect the keeping of arms in use at the time of ratification. It does not state that it only protects those arms used for self defense; although, in truth, all arms can be used for self defense. 3. The constitutional standard of review for 2A is one of text informed by the history and tradition of gun laws at the time of ratification.   What did the Bruen ruling say?  1. There is a right to bear arms outside of the home.   2. States could not have arbitrary conditions for carry permits; that prohibit average Americans, who are not prohibited people, from exercising their right to bear arms.   3. Self defense is a constitutionally valid reason to be armed.   4. It reaffirmed the standard of review for gun regulation, that was established by heller. In order to show a modern gun law is constitutional, it is the burden of the government to show a corresponding law from the time of ratification. Laws from the time of reconstruction can be used, although they will carry less weight, as long as they do not contradict the tradition of the time of ratification. It did not establish that the only purpose for 2A is self defense.  You don’t have to wait to see if this standard of review applies to 2A, as a whole, or just CCW. Besides the fact that the language of both Heller and Bruen plainly stated that all gun regulations have to pass this standard of review, the Supreme Court took up a few AW bans and mag bans, after the Bruen ruling was released. They struck the lower courts’ rulings in favor of these laws, and sent the cases back to the lower courts with insurrections to make new rulings **based off of the standards set by the Bruen ruling**.  So, it’s very obvious that the standard applies to 2A, as a whole.   A militia is a military force drawn from the civilian population *to supplement the army during an emergency*. Throughout all of history, militiamen have been required to furnish their own arms and equipment. You can go back to Anglo Saxon England and see that Fyrd( militia) members were expected to have their own arms. The king did not supply their arms.  NG members do not supply their own arms. The government arms and equips them. Yes, they have limited times of service, like a part time military, but their required NG time is not limited to training. They also do not supplement the other military branches, as additional forces to aid the primary military. They are put to use, instead of other branches, the same way each other branch gets applied to its own tasks. I imagine you are familiar with the army reserve. They serve one weekend a month and a two week summer camp. Very similar to the NG, really; except they don’t get called into service unless the regular army needs more soldiers. In spite of this similarity, the army reserve isn’t considered a militia. It’s part of the army: meaning it’s standing army. The NG is considered another branch of the military.   “The NG is a state based military force that becomes part of the reserve components of the US Army and US Air Force when activated for federal missions. It is a military reserve force composed of NG *military* members or units of each state...”  https://constitutionalmilitia.org/national-guard-not-a-militia/  DeSantis planned to revive Florida’s state militia, although there is a Florida NG, and this is because the NG is not a state militia.   Your anecdote about Washington is being misapplied. Originally, the founding fathers had not wanted to give the federal government the power to even have a military. They wanted to solely use state militias for national defense, because standing armies get used against the people. They changed their minds about this, because they realized militias, alone, could not properly defend the country. So, they gave the government the power to have a standing army, and felt that the fact that all of the people would be armed would prevent that military from being used successfully against the people. It was always intended that all the people be armed in similar manner to the military, and history will show you that this was the state of things, until the 20th century. Therefore, by the Bruen standard of review, the unorganized militia ( meaning all of the people) definitely have a claim to all the weapons of a soldier.  “Congress have no power to disarm the militia. **Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American**.... [T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.”  -Tenche Cox    The number of civilian ( unorganized ) militias, in the US, has exploded over the last few years, so I think reality disagrees with you.   You don’t sound too skeptical of government to me. In fact, you seem to think our rights come from the constitution and the government, and that government has the just power to decide what our rights are and what their powers are. Our rights do not come from the government. They do not come from the constitution. They come ‘from our creator’. They are natural rights. The constitution protects them. Government is not the supreme law of the land. The constitution is. Any law that contradicts the constitution is not valid- Alexander Hamilton.   If you let the government determine your rights, you will end up with no rights, and if you let the government determine its own limitations, it will have no limitations.  You should check out the Tenth Amendment Center. You’d be better informed of your rights and the constitution.  https://youtube.com/@TenthAmendmentCenter']"

Again, I literally said that there's nothing inherently wrong with age gap relationships, and that the nature of the relationship is dependent on someone's motives.   Does the older have a pattern of sexually pursuing very young adults? If so, why? Would they go younger if it were legal?   Agai,n while there are exceptions, it's not a little-known fact that age gap relationships tend to be unsuccessful, for a multitude of reasons.   Possibly, it's still not the majority. Many people seem to forget that these older women (and men) who dislike age gap relationships are parents, and simply don't want their kids being taken taken advantage of by older adults."", "" I think you're seeing this backward. The actual age gap isn't the issue.  If a 75-year-old dates a 50-year-old, most people don't care—still a 25-year age gap but in much closer stages of life.  But when you're a 50 year which dates a 25 year (especially if you show a pattern of doing it), it begs the question, why? Assuming you aren't just hooking up with the other person, why do you want to be in a relationship with someone you probably have little in common with?  Are you super immature?  Or is it more nefarious because you know you can use the age gap to manipulate the other person in many ways? Even if you're intentions are good large age-gap relationships can lead serious issues, with one person taking advantage of the other. The age gap is an indicator the relationship may be unhealthy. It doesn't automatically mean it is, but it's a pretty good indicator, especially if the younger person is in their teen or early twenties.   I'm a gay woman getting close to middle age. Do I find women in their 20s objectively attractive? Sure. Would I date one? No. Because I would like to have something in common with my partner. I would like them to be at a similar stage in life, both emotionally and career-wise. And yeah, I'm going to side-eye most people (regardless of gender) who date people much younger than them. Especially if they actively seek out those relationships because it means there's a particular reason they want someone much younger. And almost none of those reasons are wholesome.   Yes, there are many ways people can be abusive in relationships.  Did someone imply that non-age gap relationships were always rainbows and butterflies? But would you deny it's easier when one partner has been making money for an extra 25 years for financial abuse to occur?""]"

But sure we can cover it all.  From the Canadian Paediatrics Society’s review of the medical literature:  [“It has been estimated that 111 to 125 normal infant boys (for whom the risk of UTI is 1% to 2%) would need to be circumcised at birth to prevent one UTI.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) And UTIs can easily be treated with antibiotics.  [""The foreskin can become inflamed or infected (posthitis), often in association with the glans (balanoposthitis) in 1% to 4% of uncircumcised boys.""](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) This is not common and can easily be treated with an antifungal cream if it happens.  [“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) And condoms must be used regardless.  [""Decreased acquisition of HSV   NNT = 16""](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) Comparatively better than hiv, but the repercussions are still not in line with removal of body parts, either preventively or once infected.  HPV has a vaccine.  Last note regarding all STIs: STIs are not even relevant to newborns or children. So the informed decision can go to the informed patient themself later in life.   [“Decreased penile cancer risk: [Number needed to circumcise] = 900 – 322,000”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision).  [""An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction. This therapy ... allow[s] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision.""](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision)  These stats are terrible, it\'s disingenuous for these to be called legitimate health benefits. And more importantly, all of these items have a different treatment or prevention method that is both more effective and less invasive.    The standard to intervene on someone else\'s body is medical necessity. The Canadian Paediatrics Society puts it well:  [“Neonatal circumcision is a contentious issue in Canada. The procedure often raises ethical and legal considerations, in part because it has lifelong consequences and is performed on a child who cannot give consent. Infants need a substitute decision maker – usually their parents – to act in their best interests. Yet the authority of substitute decision makers is not absolute. In most jurisdictions, **authority is limited only to interventions deemed to be medically necessary.** In cases in which medical necessity is not established or a proposed treatment is based on personal preference, interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices. With newborn circumcision, medical necessity has not been clearly established.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision)  To override someone\'s body autonomy rights the standard is medical necessity. Without necessity the decision goes to the patient themself, later in life. Circumcision is very far from being medically necessary.   See the medical ethics above. There doesn\'t need to be a reason ""not to cut"". Those that want to circumcise others have to prove *medical necessity*. That\'s the direction this goes, and what the burden of proof is.     Arguably the complication rate is literally 100%, since [the foreskin which is the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847)) And since circumcision is not medically necessary.  Only by ignoring the removal of the foreskin can a lower complication rate be claimed. Or complications be limited only to surgical complications.   Ethicist Earp discusses the claim that it’s easier at birth: [“This claim is based on retrospective comparisons on non-concurrent studies using dissimilar populations, dissimilar methods and criteria for identifying complications, and they fail to adequately control for the method used, the device, the skill of the practitioner, the environment, and so on. So this claim which is oft repeated why it must be done early, because you’re running out of other reasons, is based on a very poor data analysis.”](https://youtu.be/SB-2aQoTQeA?t=32m21s)  This also portrays it as an either-then-or-now scenario, which is a false dichotomy. It doesn\'t need to happen at all.   Only by ignoring the removal of the foreskin can a lower complication rate be claimed. Or complications be limited only to surgical complications.  Ethicist Brian Earp discusses this idea: [“if you assign any value whatsoever to the [foreskin] itself, then its sheer loss should be counted as a harm or a cost to the surgery. ... [Only] if you implicitly assign it a value of zero then it’s seen as having no cost by removing it, except for additional surgical complications.”](https://youtu.be/SB-2aQoTQeA?t=2m32s   Continuing from above:   “Fine-touch pressure thresholds in the adult penis”  Which finds that [the foreskin **itself** is the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847))   That study’s conclusion: [""The transitional region from the external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis. Circumcision ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis.""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847)   You can make that argument, and as such you are free to decide for your own body. The standard to intervene on someone else\'s body is medical necessity. Without medical necessity, the individual themself can look at the information themself and make their own informed decision, later in life.

Which is why it\'s good that I never did this. I just mentioned other terrible things that she has said.   Who else? I genuinely am not aware. I don\'t doubt it since Bernie makes terrible judgement all around.   In some ways yes. But being anti-Israel is not the same as being anti-semitic. I support a one-state solution, but find a two-state solution to be the next best thing. Am I anti-semitic for my ideal proposal having the result that Israel stops being an ethnostate?    This article is unclear to me in one regard- is believing that Israel should open the borders to anyone who left during the Nakba as my first proposal for peace the same as me ""denying Israel the right to exist?"" If so, then I take issue with being charged as anti-semitic. I have a problem with an awful political institution, not with Jews.   The ADL\'s definition of anti-semitism (linked in the article) is actually my biggest problem here- it states that opposing Israel\'s right to exist ""as a Jewish State"" is anti-semitic. Am I anti-semitic for opposing Israel\'s 2018 law which stated that Jews have the ""exclusive right of self-determination"" within Israel? Am I anti-semitic for opposing their marriage naturalization policy involving marriages from Palestine, which Israel does out of anxiety of having a larger number of Palestinians? Am I anti-semitic for wanting Palestinians to have travel to  Israel?  I actually agree with a lot of points that this article makes. I think that many people end up being reductive and see Israel as the only aggressor in many scenarios. I believe that a massive issue is black and white thinking. The overall point about the way that anti-semitic ideas spread among the left is something that I\'ve thought about for a long time.  I kinda have a take about this. While people on the far left DO often end up being anti-semitic in their blind obedience to, people who blindly support  Israel\'s actions are anti-Palestinian. However, being anti-Palestinian in the West affects fewer people, since few Palestinians live here. Large numbers of Jews live here, so anti-semitism has actual effects. Additionally, anti-Palestinian sentiment has historically been less targeted at individuals and institutions in the US.   My answer to this is to teach people to stop seeing things in black and white. I\'ll be honest, I get extremely frustrated with people on the left when they use unclear language to mask what they mean like ""Decolonize Palestine"" and then refuse to acknowledge any facts. I had a friend like this. But I still find it strange to condemn all of the left for this.    You had me until here. The BDS organization might be run by terrorists and anti-semitites, but I believe that boycotting, divesting, and sanctioning is an acceptable way to express outrage at what Israel is doing to Palestinians. This is similar to how BLM means more than what the founders of the BLM movement say it does.', 'American Jews support Israel. American Jews have plenty of saying in Israel politics since Israel is a US colony. American Jews could ask their politicians to stop supporting Israel. Like biden said: silence is complicity. If American Jews do not speak out they are complicit, twice: once as Jews, since Israel purports itself as the country for all the Jews in the world; twice because as American citizens they can oppose USA aid to Israel.', 'I never disputed that. You’re still “simplifying” the situation by ignoring that 1. The Palestinians and Arabs attempted to do that exact thing in Israel, 2. Jews were ethnically cleansed across the Middle East and now reside in Israel, comprising more than half of the Jewish population, 3. Palestinians actually can (and many do) have Israeli citizenship and rights there, while Jews cannot elsewhere in the Middle East, and 4. Palestinian leadership still aspires to cleansing Israel of Jews.  None of the above is meant to excuse what Israel is doing, but rather to point out that it isn’t so clearly good vs evil. There is good and evil among both Israelis and Palestinians (and every people on earth).  It’s also questionable that some people’s first reaction to an article about anti-semitism in the US is to turn the thread into a critique of Israel. Criticizing Israel certainly isn’t anti-Semitic on its own, but I can guarantee some of the folks writing above certainly are.']"

We even have 382 kilograms of Moon rock that Apollo astronauts brought back to Earth. These rocks have been independently verified as lunar by laboratories around the world.        Also, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) takes high resolution pictures of the lunar surface from a low orbit. During its mission, it captured [the landing sites](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-sites.html)and the abandoned descent modules and rovers from the Apollo missions. And its resolution is so good it has picked up the dark squiggly paths that the astronaut’s footprints made. Spacecraft from China, India and Japan have also spotted these landing sites, providing further independent verification of the landings.

Using foster care as your example is improper, since not even every child in foster care is even eligible for adoption, and those that are have issues that an infant would generally not have.    There is a waiting list for infants to adopt.  The foster system is not where infants go when adoptions are arranged for them.   Being alive is only half of the equation.

Generally, Child Protective Services (CPS) takes a child into the foster care system after reports of abuse or neglect. Instead of the parents choosing foster care for their child, this is usually done on court orders.

On-campus dorms could house fewer than 4,000 students out of a total student body of more than 30,000. Most facilities were badly outdated, and the average student paid $12,800 a year (in 2016 dollars) in tuition to attend.  Today, Temple, where I work, looks very different. Beautiful new buildings are the norm rather than the exception. A recently built 24-story dorm and adjoining dining center highlights the university’s transition to a residential campus. Each of the dorm’s apartment-style suites comes equipped with a flat-screen TV and other amenities. The number of administrators in management and executive positions has grown by 40 percent to over 900. Oh, and tuition now runs $19,000 for the typical student after accounting for scholarships and other aid.  It’s tempting to blame Temple’s shiny buildings and new administrators for the big increase in tuition. But there’s another, much more important reason for the rising costs: Over the same period, Pennsylvania’s state government cut its per-student appropriations by $6,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars.  The rapid increase in the cost of college in recent decades — and the associated explosion in student debt, which now totals nearly $1.3 trillion nationally — is all too familiar to many Americans. But few understand what has caused the tuition boom, particularly at the public institutions that enroll roughly two-thirds of all students at four-year colleges. Many commenters,\xa0particularly\xa0in the\xa0popular press, focus on ballooning administrative budgets and extravagant student amenities. Those elements have played a role, to be sure, but by far the single biggest driver of rising tuitions for public colleges has been declining state funding for higher education.  It is true that today’s students enjoy better amenities — usually in the form of nicer gyms, dorms and dining halls, though some campuses feature\xa0lazy rivers and climbing walls\xa0— than I or, especially, my parents did during our time in college. It is also true that today’s universities employ far more administrators and staff who don’t have any direct role in either research or instruction. When my father attended the University of Florida1\xa0in the 1970s, professors were required to also serve as academic advisors and meet individually with students to plan their schedules. Today, schools retain many staffers whose role is to assist both faculty and students. Some of those jobs are easy to mock: One\xa0frustrated grad student\xa0built a\xa0job-title generator\xa0that spits out bloated titles such as vice executive for the committee on dining relations.  Recent Stories from FiveThirtyEight  ￼Top Storiesby\xa0FiveThirtyEight00:3701:12￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼33 Cool Charts We MadeIn 2022  And it is also true that professors (at least those on the tenure track) are paid better than the people who held those same jobs years ago. Average salaries for full professors (the highest rank) at\xa0top public institutions exceed\xa0$160,000 annually. Salaries for full professors have risen 12 percent in excess of inflation since 2000.  All of those trends add to the cost of college, but not by that much. At most, about a quarter of the increase in college tuition since 2000 can be attributed to rising faculty salaries, improved amenities and administrative bloat. By comparison, the decline in state support accounts for about three-quarters of the rising cost of college.  Consider Pennsylvania’s four public research institutions,2\xa0one of which is Temple.3\xa0Average tuition revenue per student (adjusted for inflation) increased by $5,880 between the 2000-01 and 2013-14 academic years (the most recent available data). State appropriations per student have declined nearly $4,000 over the same period, from about $7,750 to $3,900. Put another way, if Pennsylvania restored funding for higher education to its 2000 levels, Pennsylvania’s public research institutions could reduce tuition by nearly $4,000 per year without altering their budgets. For students, the impact could be even greater once loan fees and interest were taken into account.  By contrast, imagine that each of these institutions cut per-student spending for student services, administration and instruction back to 2000 levels, then passed those savings on to students in the form of lower tuition. How much would students save? Reducing student services would save each student $380 per year. Dropping all those new administrators would save $150 per student per year. And rolling back spending on faculty salaries would save $850 per year for the average student. Together, those three categories have added $1,380 to the cost of attendance since 2000, about a quarter of the total increase. At least some of that spending benefits students directly: Student-service spending has been found to increase the\xa0likelihood of graduating, and increased spending on instruction leads to\xa0higher earnings\xa0later in life.  National trends for all public four-year schools mirror those from the research institutions of Pennsylvania, although there are sizable differences across states, as the table below shows. In the median state, South Carolina, the decline in state appropriations explains 81 percent of the increase in tuition revenue. Only three states — Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming — have kept funding for higher education on pace with inflation and enrollment growth (represented by negative numbers in the table). In 17 states, the price of college would have actually\xa0declined\xa0since 2000 (states with a share greater than 100 percent in the table) if funding had been kept constant and the schools applied that money entirely to students’ tuition bills. While state funding has rebounded somewhat during the economic recovery following the Great Recession, most states’ increases have not kept pace with enrollment growth.']

That second one would be a really good source for you to read honestly.     When prostitution is legalized, human trafficking and sex crimes increase. This fact is well-documented and researched. There are other ways to protect people that don’t involve harming many more.     Yes, that is my argument. There are many border towns where destination prostitution occur—these places have lots of very depressing problems.     Many prostitutes in developed nations are migrants, and the money is a huge factor bringing these workers in to do the jobs. And yes, many are trafficked. But the ones who aren’t are financially coerced, at the very least. They are financially taken advantage of, there’s no way around that fact.     And I think you’re in denial. Also that you’re applying a narrow scope stance based on personal liberty while failing to see the bigger picture and its problems (especially if you look beyond the individual case).     Many pornstars have quit and have criticized the industry, heavily. There is a lot of coercion, pressure, fraud/changed terms, etc—it can be very, very fucked up. Also most pornstars aren’t really paid all that well, especially for what the labor involves. And I’m serious, you should read some of the accounts from ex-pornstars; some people have been very harmed by that industry, and that’s putting it lightly.    I would say that your advertisement would be sexual coercion. I don’t understand how you can think that paying someone to use them like an object or commodity for your own pleasure isn’t gross. Like at some point the thought has to enter your head that they wouldn’t want this or be doing this if you hadn’t leveraged financial pressure on them, right?

Guide to Interpreting VAERS Data Evaluating VAERS Data Person looking at charts on a hand-held device When evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event.  VAERS Data Limitations Millions of vaccines are given each year to children less than 1 year old in the United States, usually between 2 and 6 months of age. At this age, infants are at greatest risk for certain medical adverse events, including high fevers, seizures, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Some infants will experience these medical events shortly after a vaccination by coincidence.  These coincidences make it difficult to know whether a particular adverse event resulted from a medical condition or from a vaccination. Therefore, vaccine providers are encouraged to report all adverse events following vaccination, whether or not they believe the vaccination was the cause.  When reviewing data from VAERS, please keep in mind the following limitations: VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning that reports about adverse events are not automatically collected, but require a report to be filed to VAERS. VAERS reports can be submitted voluntarily by anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, or family members. Reports vary in quality and completeness. They often lack details and sometimes can have information that contains errors.  ""Underreporting"" is one of the main limitations of passive surveillance systems, including VAERS. The term, underreporting refers to the fact that VAERS receives reports for only a small fraction of actual adverse events. The degree of underreporting varies widely. As an example, a great many of the millions of vaccinations administered each year by injection cause soreness, but relatively few of these episodes lead to a VAERS report. Physicians and patients understand that minor side effects of vaccinations often include this kind of discomfort, as well as low fevers. On the other hand, more serious and unexpected medical events are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes.  A report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described. It only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after vaccine was given. No proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for VAERS to accept the report. VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine.']"

It just...has never covered all our bases. It\'s never enough. Charity is too reliant on people feeling giving which varies by wealth, age, location, and awareness.   Some charities are easy to get in the city but have no reach in rural areas, meaning if you want to use the charity you have to move (""just move"" is thrown out on this sub too often as if it\'s only a matter of getting off your ass to do it, as opposed to an event that is expensive, requires coordinating jobs or having savings, and severs community or family ties).   Where I live it\'s incredibly rural and poor. Charities only exist in the city. But there are rural hospitals.   Awareness is a big one. Let\'s say there\'s a really good charity that is full of heart and doing meaningful work - but no one knows about it. It could reach so many more people if it had donations, but due to it focusing on something perhaps not very charismatic, or a seemingly niche issue, it\'s not getting funding. This is pretty common in LGBT+ stuff. Charities that focus on helping them get off the streets or find therapists or find jobs that won\'t discriminate are chronically underfunded because people just don\'t give a fuck.  This isn\'t void in the government, which is why lobbying exists, but it\'s less of an issue. Or at least when it is an issue it\'s a smoother graph. Government programs for the homeless are not *only* for select cities. They tend to be province wide.  So in short, I\'m all in favor of those private entities doing everything they can, just that I\'m not convinced they alone can ever be enough due to the demons of human nature.  Government is run by humans, so is corruptible too. But it\'s *possible* to put in really robust systems and transparencies to keep them somewhat on task and they have greater reach.  For things that I think are fundamental to human wellbeing such as food, water, shelter, education, and healthcare this is where I think the government\'s reach is highly valuable.  We already compel some things through the government, and I see no distinction between public defenders, public educators, and public doctors.  I will never say charity is a bad thing in general. I think there are bad charities - I\'ll never give to the Salvation Army because they actively fight LGBT+ assistance. But in making that choice I am now causing someone else who\'s only able to benefit from that church to get less. Because populations are asymmetrical, so too will be the things we donate to.  A government is supposed to put in hospitals and schools etc. when there\'s a need, regardless of what the people think. It\'s imperfect, but I think a better solution *in general* to these issues.  But in tandem they do even more. There are people wealthy enough to afford taxes AND donate. Were I wealthy enough I\'d be doing so. If I won the lottery I\'d be setting up programs to help LGBT+ and homeless people find safe homes, medical assistance, counseling, and jobs. I\'d also pay my taxes. But I can\'t because I don\'t have much money. Academia has money in it, but I burnt out and I\'d end up on a rope if I stuck in it too long so I sacrificed the money for something I can live with.   And this is another issue. That charity idea is pretty narrow. A lot of charities are people\'s pet projects. 1/4 of charity money in the US is for religious causes. What that means is unclear, but I grew up religious and the food bank we ran got less money than the neighboring church spent on ""charity concerts"" which raised money to host more concerts so they could expand the building and add a gym...some of these ""pet projects"" are undoubtedly less valuable to society than others, but get masked.   I don\'t like America\'s extreme disdain for even the hint of collectivism. I don\'t want a communist state, but I don\'t think it\'s either or. I think it\'s possible to have some amount of ""hey, we live in a society and we owe one another. A bunch of you aren\'t giving to charities, or you\'re giving to charities which discriminate, and that is against the spirit of our nation of helping one another without judgment.""   I think it\'s possible to lean just a little into forcing everyone to pull their weight without devolving into a dictatorship.  So, to conclude and repeat, I don\'t think charity is enough, and I don\'t think it will ever be enough.', 'You think I’m saying that when you give money to charity, it doesn’t go to a good cause?', 'It’s a government not a charity.']"
126	261	126_job_employer_employee_employers	['job', 'employer', 'employee', 'employers', 'work', 'compensation', 'employees', 'fired', 'owner', 'jobs']	"[' As well as if they didn\'t.   And I am saying that if you do a better job for a reason other than compensation, you incentivize employers to unfairly compensate you. ""Because you like your job"" is such a reason.   This is a half truth. It is good for the company *because* is is guaranteed to benefit from your increased labor per wage dollar spent, but it is only good for you if your employer notices the extra labor and fairly compensates it.  It is always good for the employer. It is only good for the employee if a company acts against its profit hoarding interests. Which is rarely.  So no, it is not also good for the employee, because they have to give the extra wages, and then *hope* to be compensated. Would it be reasonable for business to operate on that model? Go into McDonald\'s and argue that giving you extra burgers on your order is good for everyone, because your hunger will be more sated, and good for them too, because hopefully you\'ll recognize the above and beyond offering and pay more afterwards.  Such an idea is obviously unreasonable. And yet that is exactly what employees are asked to do every day.  So no. It is not good for the employee to give extra, and *hope* to be taken care of by a company that sees them as a number.  You give exactly what you are paid to. No more. No less. And whether you enjoy your job or not shouldn\'t factor into that. Because it\'s *business*.', ' And what is *actually* true is everything before ""which will lead to you getting better compensated."" Which is why it is unwise to ""do a better job"" when you\'re getting paid ""adequate job"" wages. If an employer wishes for you to do a better job, then they should include compensation for increased performance in your work agreement. If they do not, they are attempting to get the deluxe car wash after paying for the economy. That is wage theft.  ""Hey, give me the value meal for the price of a burger for a year, and hopefully I will start paying you more later.""  In *any other context*, such an arrangement would be considered an idiotic bargain, only accepted by the most naive.  But somehow, the working class has been brainwashed for.a century to accept this notion that they have a burden to prove worthy of pay before getting it, while business needn\'t prove worthy of quality work before expecting it. It is the height of entitlement. And it is exploitation. That is the status quo.   Tell me how many ""feel better about your job"" are needed to pay a car note? Is that about the same exchange rate as being paid in exposure?  You know what\'s a huge bonus? An agreement to pay a huge bonus for exceptional work. You know what isn\'t a huge bonus? Non monetary compensation. Because until a company lets me buy their widgets with job satisfaction, it has no business being in a discussion on fair compensation.   And there\'s nothing that says that everyone in the country can\'t be a millionaire. But it doesn\'t reflect reality. Appropriate salaries are things employers avoid paying as much as possible, which is why 50 years ago, the bottom 50% of earners controlled 20% of the wealth, and today, that group controls 2% of it.  Money is consistently and uniformly being funnelled away from the working class to the oligarchy. So I suppose the only people that say you can\'t get paid an appropriate salary are the people responsible for paying salaries.  The notion of surviving on job satisfaction while waiting for employers to come around on pay is possibly the most naive thing I have read today.  You can love your job. 100% support that. There are benefits for the employer and employee. *But none of those benefits should be work that is valued above what an employer is paying for.*  You can hate your job and still do it. Not my business. *But your dissatisfaction should not lead you to provide work valued below what your employer is paying for.*  In other words, job satisfaction should have no relevance, at all, to the value of the labor you provide. The only thing that should be relevant to the value of the work provided is the value of the compensation for it. Period.   Any advocacy for an increased amount of value provided, above what is paid for? Is advocacy for the exploitation of workers. You are advocating worker exploitation, despite the lip service you occasionally throw to ""that\'s wrong, but still love your job and your employer who is underpaying you and work reeeeeealllly hard so that one day, you might get noticed and rewarded, if you\'re really lucky. I mean, yeah it\'s wrong, but my message is basically to shut up, love your job, and take it.""  That\'s the message you communicate when you levy zero accountability to employers. Which is exactly the level you are levying.  This CMV is not on the benefits of job satisfaction. It is on the acceptability of providing labor exclusively based on the monetary compensation provided. My arguments are about providing labor exclusively based on the monetary compensation. Your argument is a nebulous red herring about whether or not people that like their job work harder.  It is off topic and irrelevant to the CMV.', ' I get your point. I do. It is as true as it is irrelevant.  If someone who enjoys their job.does better work because they enjoy their job, even without additional compensation, they are incentivizing an employer to exploit them.  It is fine to like your job. There are a whole host of benefits for the employer and employee. Healthier work environment and better job satisfaction are two.  But one that should never, ever, *ever* be an employer benefit is ""better quality work"". Because you liking your job is not relevant to the work you do. Or more appropriately, if the only way you will attain a fair work level is if you love your job, *you\'re a bad employee*. If you\'re a good employee, giving fair labor already, and you do more because you love your job, then every day you are not compensated for that, your employer is demonstrating that they are a bad employer.  ""Loving your job"" should have zero impact on the quality of your work. If it does, it points to the likelihood that the employee has poor willpower and self motivation, which are not  \'good employee\' traits.  I get your point. I understand it. *It just doesn\'t accurately reflect truth*.  Your employer is entitled to a fair day of your work for a fair wage.  You are entitled to fair compensation for all work you do.  Employers have been consistently failing to meet their obligations, resulting in the consequence that any employee that does being exploited.  Before you talk about being a good employee, show me a single example of a good employer, that employs over 500 people.']"

But I have links to Canada, strong links to it in Toronto and elsewhere in Ontario. I\'m not going to go against that, because I feel strongly attached to Canada as well.   Quebec did not have the same struggles as people of color, and whatever happened there is not comparable. Besides that, what is it that Quebec doesn\'t have today in Canada that is comparable to how people of color in the USA? Like I said, Quebec is the second-biggest GDP in Canada. Quebec has considerable power in anything that the federal government does, most politicians in this country come here to get votes because they cannot win without Quebec. Quebec is literally essential to Canada.  What exactly would be necessary to make enough amends for what was done in the past?   Deny what? Quebec has been given two referendums, and if they wanted a third they would get it. You\'re being denied nothing. Yes lost twice. Maybe you should stop denying that, and maybe you should stop denying that the other Québécois have made their choice to stay in Canada.   Because I already know where this goes. You\'re trying to guilt-trip me by saying things like ""why would you deny Quebec this or that?"" when that is not true at all. I know what comes next, and I know what you\'re going to say, because every time this conversation comes up and separatists find that someone does not agree with them, they resort to cheap tactics. It\'s all over the movement, and that shit with the n-word was exactly that as well.   A moderator from arr Quebec did it once, blocked me because I asked him to produce evidence of how Parizeau was denounced, he couldn\'t, so he blocked me. Others went around calling me a colonizer, a Russian partisan, or denying that I am Latino and calling me an anglophone instead. You want me to see your side? Then start to acknowledge the problems of yours. There\'s a debt to pay in there, and you can blame your fellow separatists for that.   I didn\'t do anything to them. I learned the language, I integrated, and I chose to move here instead of every other place in Canada. I\'m not sure what more can be asked of me. I\'m not some fucking bum coming to Quebec to demand special privileges or ask that I be spoken to in English. But I will also not let people talk me down and tell me shit, because I don\'t agree with their viewpoints. If their cause is so weak that they have no good arguments to convince me then that is their fault.']"

It’s getting old at this point.   You’ve said my friends and family are wrong in saying it helps them. Why are they wrong? Well because “I’m right”. That’s your argument.   Your position is “my opinion is this. And it’s fact. Therefore anyone else’s opinion is invalid”. Everyone who says therapy helps them is ignorant and wrong. Why? Because “I’m right”.   You have it all figured out. Therapy doesn’t work because you say it doesn’t work. People who need or benefit from therapy don’t need or benefit from therapy. Why? Because “I’m right”.   A healthy person can’t go to therapy and get benefit from it regularly. Why? Because “I’m right”  The same way someone gets benefit from a personal trainer, that can’t happen with a therapist. Why? Because “I’m right”.   You’ve convinced yourself your opinion is fact. That’s why your response to direct examples is either deny their existence or say they’re wrong. Why? Because “I’m right”.   You’ve made no argument beyond “I’m right”. There’s no nuance to your view. There’s no argument as to why it doesn’t work beyond “it doesn’t work because I say so”.   Therapy can’t be for stability and improvement. Why? Because “I’m right”.   In your mind, therapy is only “you need fixing and when you’re fixed, you’re done”. So someone going to therapy for any other reason is invalid. Why? Because “I’m right”.   Absolutely none of your arguments or comments go beyond “I’m right” why are you right?

That’s like me arguing going to a personal trainer makes you less physically fit. There’s no logic there. And there’s no logic in you saying a therapist makes you less mentally fit.   I’m telling you why some people go to therapy. Your argument is “I’m right and you’re wrong” and “I know what’s best” and “I know what’s best for these people”.   Again, the argument of this post is that therapy is bad for you. I have specific examples where people benefit from regular therapy. This isn’t to say it’s for everyone or that everyone would benefit from regular therapy. Same goes for physical fitness.   Some people don’t want or need a personal trainer to be physically fit. Some people do. And going to one helps you in objective ways. The same is true for therapy. Not everyone wants or needs therapy to be mentally fit. Not everyone wants or needs regular therapy. Some people choose to because it helps them.   Your argument of “no. These people who say they benefit from this are wrong. I’m right” isn’t an argument. That’s you plugging your ears and going “lalalalalala” to preserve your own opinion, when presented with evidence that contradicts your view.   You’re working backward from “I’m right and nothing will change my mind”. That’s why you deny the existence of the specific group of people I mentioned who choose to go to regular therapy to maximize their mental fitness.   I’m working from “therapy helps these people stay mentally fit”. You’re choosing to listen to yourself over others while saying others are saying “I’m right and I know what’s best”. Your argument is pure projection.   You’re making a blanket statement that regular therapy doesn’t and can’t work. All I have to do is give one example of it working for someone and benefiting them to prove you wrong. Which I’ve done. You refusing to acknowledge that reality isn’t an argument. And you saying “nope. They don’t exist/they’d be better off without therapy/therapy is bad for them” isn’t an argument.   I’m not making a blanket statement. I’m saying regular therapy can help people. To prove me wrong, you need to prove that regular therapy in all cases is bad and never works. You haven’t done that. You’ve simply repeatedly said “I’m right. Therapy is bad”.  And then you pretend all therapy is fixing someone, when that’s not why all people go to therapy. Some go to stay mentally fit, not to get better. Your refusal to a acknowledge this group of people and respond is a forfeiting response.   I give examples of refusal therapy helping people and you respond with examples of how it could be bad, which is irrelevant to the examples I gave and my argument still stands.   You need to provide evidence that therapy doesn’t work. Saying “therapy doesn’t work. I know what’s best” isn’t an argument. No matter how much you want it to be. Lol']

Its only subjective to a point. But if you really want to see whats logically moral then calling morality subjective is you really not wanting to see what really is moral by logic.', ' It does have a basis which is that it is considered a sin, and homosexuality is not conducive to reproduction, something that is needed to keep the human race going. (For the record, I’m not Christian, nor do I support these beliefs. I’m playing devil’s advocate to show you the flaws in your argument)   Every moral does have a reason. The homosexuality moral does have a reason behind it. How do you determine what’s a *good* reason and what’s not? What makes you qualified to decide what’s a good reason or not? (I don’t mean that in a rude way) All of that would be subjective right? Hence why morality is subjective.    (This was in response to the morality of eating cows) I would argue that the reason is pretty good: don’t kill the animals that give milk to you. Now you might disagree with me. Hence why morality is subjective.   What you’re proposing is not an objective definition of what’s moral but rather a logical definition of how to *enforce* morality, which I already talked about in a previous comment. Referring to your example: If I decide that I can kill someone to prevent them from suffering later in life, then they can do the same to me before I get to them. If I decide to force my morals on others, they can force their morals on me and effectively cancel out whatever I do with my morals. So logically speaking, you have to let everyone practice their own morals without inflicting it on others. But that doesn’t mean that morality itself has an objective definition. Going back to the cow example, I’ve decided that it’s immoral to eat cows and I have a reason to back that up. As long as I don’t force it others and they don’t force their morals on me, we’re all good.', 'The definition of what’s moral itself is always subjective   However, the only logical aspect of morality are that you can’t force your own morals on others and that you have to be consistent in your morals. And the reason why I say that is that if you force your morals on others, they can do the same by your own standards, and that would be paradoxical. For example, if I force you to give me your shirt on the basis that it’s moral for me to do so, then you can just force me to give it back by my own morals, and we would be back where we were.  So maintaining moral consistency and respecting individual boundaries in morality are the only logical aspects of morality. The actual definition of what is or isn’t moral is entirely subjective. I can say that wearing a red shirt is immoral, and that would just be my own subjective definition of morality.']

However I do still think that someone who makes a confession and claims it is false should be treated as having done the crime they confessed to (unless there is irrefutable proof they didn’t do it.) For the simple reason that this prevents actual criminals from recanting their confessions if they think they can get away with it.', ""You just accepted option 1. Meaning that you're sentencing two people for two crimes, *of which we know each of them are innocent of one of the charges*.  So, Person 1 and Person 2, in this very constructed example, we (somehow) know one of them are guilty of the murder, and one of them has falsely confessed. When they are tried in court, **what is the charge you're sentencing them for**?   You can't sentence them both for 'Murder' ***and*** 'False Confession'. No matter what, one of them is a wrongful charge, and those have to be thrown out. If you allowed multiple contradictory charges, any jury will be instructed to declare not guilty anyone for which there is insufficient evidence forwards of, and since both charges would be insufficient on their own, both would be thrown out. Any prosecutor would be screwed tried to prosecute such crimes because they'd be working against themselves as they tried to put forward their case. Your very view would guarentee the killer gets off scot free along with their inadvertent accomplice.  The jury can't decide both charges as well at the same time. These would be different trials most likely, since each defendant is not cooperative but against one another, asserting the other is the murderer. What happens if the two different juries instead decide on the individual charges?  1. If they charge the same person for both charges, it'd be easy on appeal to show that the charges are impossible! The person can't falsely have confessed AND been the actual murderer. Contradictory convictions lead to appeals, leading to retrials or potentially letting the culprit go. 2. So the jury instead charges guilty on one of the crimes... but if they declare its the Murder one for both Person 1 and Person 2, we can again guarantee an impossible charge, which would be thrown out and redone. However, now it's impossible to get either man on the false confession by Double Jeopardy, so only one of them can be found guilty of murder. You've now created a coin flip chance of sending an innocent man to jail and a murderer scot free to kill again. 3. If they declare False Confession on both, not only will the trials have to be redone, Double Jeopardy applies to the murder charge, meaning the murderer gets away with it. 4. The only thing left is to risk it on a gamble, a 50/50 chance that the juries come to different conclusions, of which both juries would not be allowed to know the other outcome if it happened earlier (as it would be poisoning their decision and easily be thrown out on appeal if they knew the other decision since it would mean a different jury had sway over the second conviction without the input of the second conviction's defendant or their defense team).  Your idea creates the perfect scenarios for murderers to get away with it by creating a terribly confusing situation that make it hard to convict, and the other person, the false confessor, has no reason to cooperate with the justice system since they're being charged to, meaning you've made enemies of the only other individual who could actually help resolve this situation.   Also, you can't prosecute conditionally, say 'Murder or False Confession'. If we allow that, then corrupt prosecutors and investigators would be only pushed forward more into punishing and harassing individuals into confessing anything whatsoever since they can guarentee a 'False Confession or \\[Other Crime\\]' charge, use whatever means of abuse they can, since the very act of any mistaken admission, nor matter how slight, guarantees them being charged under this new conditional charging. No one would ever want to cooperate with police if they'd risk being punished for anything they say to that degree, you'd make it far more riskier for people to cooperate and much easier for murderers to get away with their crimes with people more often scared to talk about anything under risk of it being taken as confessing to crimes. This makes it even easier for murderers to get away with their crimes."", ""Fine but you're equating the crime of false confession to be equivalent to every other crime up through and including murder. Even if I agree false confession is a crime it is not a crime equal to rape or murder.""]"

What about the labor extraction that the enlisted in the larmy” and the Navy, Air Force, Marines, and the National Guard, and the Coast Guard experience? Remember when I mentioned all the sexual assaults? (Side note: at no point was I saying that you didn’t care about them, I was making the point that the DoD didn’t care) Why is it they all those victims of sexual assault not part of your calculation of “loyalty.” What about the work sucking and the shitty pay? Does that factor into the military’s loyalty?  If the point was to have a ideologically loyal military regardless of strength, why wouldn’t they encourage more women and gays to join by actually preventing them from getting raped? If they wanted college educated soy boys to join more, why would they be reducing ASVAB requirements and paying only slightly more? Wouldn’t they start coming up with reasons to reject recruiting from demographically conservative places like Texas and Florida, when those states are actually recruited more per capita than any other state? Why not drop recruitment numbers and just focus on blue states?  If loyalty is the concern, why do a majority of American vets find a lot of non-ideological reasons to hate the military when they get out?', ' Again, thank you for telling me about the cultural context of the organization I’ve been inextricably a part of for 7 years person who’s not even from this fucking country. That is literally what happened you fucking dope. 10% of the American military sees active combat: the majority of the American military, including the Marines, are non-physical administrative and support roles. *Material* changes to those gender and sexual orientation restrictions were implemented to increase the potential recruitment pool without significantly increasing compensation and pay, the PR therein was just a secondary benefit. Just like it is in any other industry that wants to expand its labor pool. *Appearing* to be inclusive is the goal behind actually getting more numbers in the board.  Physical fitness standards have been loosening in the military for years. Is it because they don’t want to be fatphobic? No, it’s because the majority of enlisted roles are technical and they were losing out on retention and recruitment goals on those technical roles since America as a whole has gotten fatter. Now active field and combat roles have additional physical requirements.  The American military has also started to loosen its rules regarding usage of marijuana and anti-depressants for new recruits. Is it because they believe these people are heckin valid and vouch for #selfcare? No, it’s because it’s becoming more legalized and that they were loosing out on recruitment goals by precluding people who smoked. They still ban marijuana usage while active and severely limit access to psychotic medications because **ding ding ding** readiness matters most.  And yeah, please go to literally any forum with actual active duty members who were around since the changes in allowing homosexuals, and every single one of them will tell you that DADT wasn’t enforced and that homosexuals were serving openly prior to the official integration in 2011, because people in the military aren’t some monolith and they don’t actually care about that kind of shit, they just care that people do their jobs.  I literally had a drill instructor that was a flaming gay man that called everyone ratchet. 25% of my recruit division was too stupid to even notice that he was gay, and not a single person in bootcamp actually gave a fuck that he was a) because he was a good instructor and b) because we were significantly more worried about doing what we were supposed to be doing, not worrying about being indoctrinated. He only ever officially disclosed his orientation to a recruit on the last day during a relaxed Q&amp;A about Fleet life when a recruit asked if he was ever scared during DADT. He literally said to them “no one cares that you’re gay, just do your fucking job.”  Because the only thing that actually matters from the enlisted personnel is their role as a *LABOR FORCE.* The DoD has, and will continue to, shift their cultural decrees and public relations stances for the purpose of maximizing their recruitment pool and effectiveness of extraction of labor from their workforce, regardless of who is in power “in the regime.”', ' Oh hey, look at that, a direct quote from a General with the material justification for a progressive policy. Absolutely incredible to me that you quote that SCOTUS case without any irony despite the actual argument West Point is making about how the officer corps needs diversity in order to more effectively organize the labor of the enlisted military. Almost as if this “ideological purity” they’re striving for is a position who’s primary purpose is to maximize the effectiveness of extracting labor from the enlisted. Rather than arguing with their material claims or conclusions, you just write off the decision as being “ideologically motivated.”   Inb4 you act like I approve of West Points argument: I don’t, simply because people by and large don’t actually care about racial representation in their leadership, they just want good leaders who have similar material contexts. West Point goes wrong when they think a poor black enlisted person would be better off with rich black officer, when in reality a poor black enlisted person would have a better functional relationship with a white officer who grew up in comparable material conditions.   Yeah man, any time they do something you ideologically agree with it’s because they’re trying to trick you or play the long game despite the risk that’d supposedly have on their ideological purity a year away from an election. There’s no material explanation like recruitment and retention that better explains it.   You know enlisted branches don’t even have diversity quotas right? Even in your West Point example, that was a studied they did with regards to race balancing in context of reflecting the racial make up of the enlisted sections of the military. The service academies are legally excerpt from Affirmative Action and are statistically less diverse than non-service Universities. Again, I’ll say this till I’m blue in the face, please give me any proof that the *enlisted military* has any ideological requirements of its labor force and how those trump the effectiveness of those peoples’ labor.     That’s exactly my point! The military establishment was literally *behind* the culture and ideological context of its labor force! It was literally illegal to be gay but the culture of the labor force was able to counteract that **top down** policy because they cared more about the work getting done. Funny that when it’s a conservative ideologically position it’s “lingering” but when it’s a progressive one it’s “unanimously unpopular and ideological warfare.”    I don’t even disagree with you doofus. My point is that progressivism is only a tool in order to maximize the extraction of labor, and that progressivism will be thrown out in favor of conservatism if Capital seems if and when it’s effective to do so. But to use your homosexuality example, why is it that when something because popular enough you just don’t have to call it progressive regardless of what legal and political power is behind that idea?  Again, if you’re gonna wax poetic about culture and ideology, at least talk to real people about it for 5 fucking seconds before assuming some bullshit study that won’t even be implemented is more important than labor conditions.']

Yes, it has in the past, but population growth globally has been declining for decades, and most population scientists agree that the human population will balance out at around 10-12 billion people.   You are absolutely correct about the economy having to grow with a global population though, everyone wants a comfortable place to live, and everyone should have those basic necessities. The economy will have to be bigger than the economies, and to get there the economy will have to grow.   Growth is not good or bad, you are correct about that also, and if my post made it seem like I was saying it was good or bad, that's my bad for misspeaking.    The problem is how we use our resources. Apple could make a cell phone that is more easily repairable, but does not so it can sell more electronics.  That's not a sustainable use of resources, but the demand for growth in profits is demanded from the shareholders.   We could build better houses that last longer, and will be cheaper in the long run, but investors in development firms demand the growth of profits. Those homes use more energy than they otherwise would have, and will have to be torn down sooner than an otherwise better built house.   That's not sustainable, and that uses more resources.    That's the fundamental issue here, is the growth in how many resources we are using.  You agree that the population will grow, and we can make everything more efficient, but ultimately the Earth can only replenish resources so quickly, and the Earth can only support a certain number of people at a certain consumption level.  We can make things more efficient, but we can't escape physics.    We need to reduce the resources per Capita that we are using, otherwise our modem society will collapse in the not too distant future.    Companies and shareholders demanding greater profits, selling more electronics, selling more beef, selling more and bigger car, are driving us towards this cliff, and the growth in wasteful business practices like that is the growth that I am arguing against."", ""The fertility rate in developed countries is low, but they consume the most per capita so can reduce emissions more by reducing population.  I don't think it's difficult, just un-attempted.   The free birth control is just a very cheap/obvious/effective thing we could do to reduce consumption if we had the political will.  It's not that we can't act to reduce the population in a non-sinister way, we just don't care to.        It's counterintuitive, and may require some foreign aid, but [reduced infant/child mortality does reduce the fertility rate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1670537/).      There's other things we can do in developed countries like making population/environmental issues &amp; sex education part of the basic educational curriculum, increase access to abortion, make “ending population growth” one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and greatly increase the amount of foreign aid going to family planning.               In developing countries we can focus on female education (ideally beyond the age of 16) which also reduces fertility rate.  Immigration from developing Countries to developed ones will also help people reduce the birth rate as they live a higher standard of living with social safety nets (like a national pension) they will have less kids."", ""Aren't fertility rates already low in most developed countries? Outside providing birth control, I think it would be very difficult to limit population growth in a way that does not seem sinister.

This happened in most major nations before ending the gold standard, specifically the British Empire did it repeatedly in the lead up to the Great Depression in an effort to fight rampant deflation.  * Governments ending the gold standard, removing its value as currency entirely.  * Gold rushes like those of the late 1800s devastating the price of gold.  * Gold based currency was regularly being debased by governments from the Roman Empire until it was finally replaced by paper money.

Which is why it\'s bad to talk about sexual orientation with those words, especially in schools, because a lot of kids will absolutely understand that negative connotation.

Both the Subjective theory of value and the Marginal theory of value have their place but keep in mind all theories use the term value but actually mean very different things.   The SNLT of mudpies is not changed. How many hours of work are needed to produce something isnt affected by how good or bad it is for society. Of course is society is damaged by something like and decides it is worth it to get rid of it that consumes labour time as well but is a second calculation of the SNLT of a service with a positive impact. Use value (utility) can be negative such as the example with nuclear waste on its own or positive such as a wanted product. Value (SNLT) can not be negative because no method of production consumes negative  time. Finally the exchage value (Price) is the relationship between one comodity and the market (aka. all alternative purchases).

Trade with the USSR in particular in resources like rubber that the USSR could obtain from Asia is how the Nazis got past the British naval blockade. And this is at the best time to deliver the killer blow to the beast when 3 million men and almost all the aircraft and tanks were committed in the west.   Then why no blow in 1940?

Without all that imported oil the germans would never have achieved their victory spearheaded by concentrated armor in the Battle of France. Without gold and equipment from Czechoslovakia the germans would never have even been able to win the war from 1939-1940 so decisively.  The Soviets traded with the Germans to buy for time, their armed forces were not ready for a decisive invasion of Germany at that point. You are again spreading your western liberal propaganda, trying to act like the west is on a position of imagined moral superiority. In reality in 1939 there was nothing about the British, Americans or French that gave them any kind of ""moral superiority"". They were all vicious and brutal imperialists that massacred thousands and hundreds of thousands of people to feed capital and profit, they were worse than the nazis before 1939 but relatively better (and still very very evil) than the nazis after their genocide in concentration camps, noting of course that the Germans murdered atleast 15 million civilian slavs in the balkans and east.   The Soviet army was not ready for a war with Germany yet. They needed until 1943 to go on the offensive even after the war started in 1941.   I don\'t know, ask them lol.

So he doesn't count. Where's a prominent leader voted out by the people?   1939 is after 1921 and after 1934, so I dont care. Its besides the point. The Poles were able to send up to 700k troops and the French 3 million. The French leadership turned out to be cowards and lost their country as a result, quite deservingly. The USSR wasn't even necessary to counter the Germans in 1939 had the Western allies put their heart into the 1939 offensive. Fortunately they helped the USSR out a lot with lend lease and strategic bombing campaigns.  Since we're stuck on ww2 for some reason or another let me close with Phillips P. O'Brien in the Journal of Strategic Studies, East versus West in the defeat of Nazi Germany  from the evidence in the survey is that the Second World War in Europe was, economically speaking, an air war. The German war economy was geared, more than anything else, to the construction and supply of aircraft and anti-air weaponry. In the crucial year of 1943, more than 41 per cent of German munitions production was devoted to making aircraft alone.  The next closest area, at a little more than 29 per cent, was ammunition, followed by naval vessels at 8.43 per cent, weapons (from anti-aircraft guns to artillery pieces to small arms) at 8.02 per cent, motor vehicles at 4.08 per cent, and halftracks at 1.78 per cent. The production of Panzers, considered the queen of the battlefields on the Eastern Front, took up only 6.27 per cent of German war production. In other words tank production took up only three-quarters as much of German production as naval construction, and less than one-sixth as much of German production as aircraft building. The domination of aircraft production continued for the rest of the war. In 1944 the percentage of the German economy devoted to building planes rose and in July of that year, when overall German munitions production reached its peak, over 48 per cent of German war production was aircraft. A further way of measuring the importance of aircraft production within the framework of the German economy can be seen not only by measuring the value of product assigned to each combatant service, but in the allocation of the German workforce. In a speech given by Albert Speer in August 1944, the Reichminister stated that even after the enormous relative increases in tank and self-propelled gun production achieved since early 1943, aircraft production still occupied far more workers than any other single part of the German war economy.   At that time more than 2,100,000 workers were involved in aircraft production while only 1,900,000 were involved in all army production, and 500,000 were employed by the navy. The preeminence of aircraft construction in economic production should lead to a reevaluation of how exactly Germany was defeated. This can best be done by looking at 1943, a year which is often seen as the turning point of the Second World War in Europe. The year 1943 is crucial for several reasons. In 1939 and 1940 the Germans were primarily occupied fighting the West, while in 1941 and 1942 the war against Russia received the highest priority. In 1943, however, the Germans came under attack from both sides. It was the year that saw the great Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk, victories that ended the possibility of any further German strategic offensives on the Eastern Front. In the West, 1943 was when the British and Americans launched their invasions of Sicily and Italy, and began the first large-scale strategic bombing campaign against Germany. Thus, 1943 is also regularly used by those who like to minimise the West's contribution to the defeat of Germany. Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk are thus described as vital steps in the defeat of Germany, while the Anglo-American strategic bombing offensive is usually denigrated. The year 1943 is also important because it was the first year during which German armaments production began to expand dramatically. German war production, as is widely known, was surprisingly limited during the first years of the Second World War. Inefficient utilisation of economic resources in 1939, 1940, and 1941 led to only marginal increases. Between the beginning of 1940 and the end of 1941, total German armament production hardly increased at all.16  In almost every area of weaponry Germany was actually outproduced, in quantity if not in quality, by its opponents before 1943. From this point on home defense received the lion's share of new German production. By 1 January 1944, over 54 per cent of all Luftwaffe operational front-line aircraft strength was in Germany or the West resisting the bomber offensive, with an additional 10 per cent in the Mediterranean and approximately 35 per cent on the Eastern Front.  This kind of deployment would continue for much of the rest of the war. At the same time that the West was soaking up more and more German air resources, it was destroying proportionally more and more as well. Air combat for the Luftwaffe was always more dangerous against the British and Americans than against the Russians. The technological inferiority of the Soviets led to a considerably smaller percentage of German losses on the Eastern Front, even when the Luftwaffe was greatly outnumbered by the Red Air Force. As a point of comparison 3,936 German planes were lost fighting the British and American air forces in the Mediterranean between January and November 1943, while only 3,773 aircraft were lost on the Eastern Front.  When one adds the even larger figure of 4,225 aircraft lost in either Western Europe or the defense of the Reich in the same period, it becomes clear that the British and Americans played by far the largest role in tying down and destroying the German air force in 1943. In percentage terms about 68.5 per cent of all German losses were caused by the British and Americans and the remaining 31.5 per cent by the Russians. These increased losses are extremely important because 1943, as said above, was a year in which German aircraft production leapt markedly. Almost all of this increase occurred in fighter construction. In 1943 the Germans built 10,898 fighters compared to 5,515 the year before.39 However, the Germans were unable to reap any advantage from this extremely large production increase because it was almost all diverted or destroyed by the even larger effort put forward by the Western Allies. Instead of being able to overwhelm the technologically-inferior Russian Air Force on the Eastern Front, the Luftwaffe saw its newest and most professional units continually ground down over Germany's own skies. Again, when one compares the allocation of German fighters at the beginning and the end of 1943 the importance of the West stands out clearly. In January 1943 1,045 single-engine and twin-engine fighters were based in the West running from Norway to Germany into France. At the same time280 fighters were based in the Mediterranean and Balkans, and 445 were fighting in Russia. By 1 January 1944 the number of German fighters in the West had grown by 605 to 1,650, while the corresponding figures for the Mediterranean had grown by 85 to 365 and that for the Eastern Front had actually dropped by 20 to 425.

An interview with Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos By Christine Johnson Continuum Autumn 1997 http://virusmyth.com/aids/hiv/cjinterviewep.htm  **Robert Gallo is a fraud** https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html  Dr. Peter Duesberg states:  “For them to justify their existence and their expenses, and make their careers they have to find infectious diseases.”  “The more diseases that they could lump into this AIDS syndrome, ‘S’ stands for Syndrome, the better the chances are they get patients under that umbrella. The more patients they could catch.”  **PCR inventor Kary Mullis writes:**   “In 1988 I was working as a consultant at Specialty Labs in Santa Monica, CA, setting up analytic routines for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). **I knew a lot about setting up analytic routines for anything with nucleic acids in it because I invented the Polymerase Chain Reaction. That\'s why they hired me.**     Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), on the other hand, was something I did not know a lot about. Thus, when **I found myself writing a report on our progress and goals for the project, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, I recognized that I did not know the scientific reference to support a statement I had just written: ""HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.""**     **So I turned to the virologist at the next desk, a reliable and competent fellow, and asked him for the reference. He said I didn\'t need one.** I disagreed. While it\'s true that certain scientific discoveries or techniques are so well established that their sources are no longer referenced in the contemporary literature, that didn\'t seem to be the case with the HIV/AIDS connection. **It was totally remarkable to me that the individual who had discovered the cause of a deadly and as-yet-uncured disease would not be continually referenced in the scientific papers until that disease was cured and forgotten.** But as I would soon learn, the name of that individual - who would surely be Nobel material - was on the tip of no one\'s tongue.”   “After ten or fifteen meetings over a couple years, I was getting pretty upset when no one could cite the reference. I didn\'t like the ugly conclusion that was forming in my mind: The entire campaign against a disease increasingly regarded as a twentieth century Black Plague was based on a hypothesis whose origins no one could recall. That defied both scientific and common sense.     **Finally, I had an opportunity to question one of the giants in HIV and AIDS research, DL Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute,** when he gave a talk in San Diego. It would be the last time I would be able to ask my little question without showing anger, and I figured Montagnier would know the answer. So I asked him.     **With a look of condescending puzzlement, Montagnier said, ""Why don\'t you quote the report from the Centers for Disease Control? ""**     **I replied, ""It doesn\'t really address the issue of whether or not HIV is the probable cause of AIDS, does it?""**     **”No,"" he admitted, no doubt wondering when I would just go away.** He looked for support to the little circle of people around him, but they were all awaiting a more definitive response, like I was.     **”Why don\'t you quote the work on SIV [Simian Immunodeficiency Virus]?"" the good doctor offered.**     **”I read that too, DL Montagnier,"" I responded. ""What happened to those monkeys didn\'t remind me of AIDS. Besides, that paper was just published only a couple of months ago. I\'m looking for the original paper where somebody showed that HIV caused AIDS.**     This time, DL **Montagnier\'s response was to walk quickly away to greet an acquaintance across the room.”**     “We have not been able to discover any good reasons why most of the people on earth believe that AIDS is a disease caused by a virus called HIV. There is simply no scientific evidence demonstrating that this is true.     We have also not been able to discover why doctors prescribe a toxic drug called AZT (Zidovudine) to people who have no other complaint other than the fact that they have the presence of antibodies to HIV in their blood. In fact, we cannot understand why humans would take this drug for any reason.”  http://www.duesberg.com/viewpoints/kintro.html']"

In 2002-2003, it was discovered that the Service was contributing far more than necessary to fully fund its pensions, and Congress allowed the Service to contribute less to the Pension Plan. Congress decided the pension “savings” could help patch the retiree health benefit underfunding.   CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE December 27, 2006  H.R. 6407 (enacted as Public Law 109-435) changes the laws that govern the operation of the United States Postal Service (USPS), **particularly those regarding the cost of pensions and health care benefits of retired workers and the requirement to hold certain funds in escrow.**  (The) CBO estimates that H.R. 6407 will result in on-budget savings of $44.2 billion and offbudget costs of $45.7 billion over the 2007-2016 period. (The net expenditures of the USPS are classified as “off-budget.”) **Thus, CBO estimates the net cost to the unified budget will be $1.5 billion over the 2007-2016 period.** All of those effects reflect changes in direct spending. The legislation does not affect federal revenues.  H.R. 6407 will not affect how much the federal government spends on pension or health care benefits for USPS retirees. By changing how much the Postal Service pays to finance those benefits and by eliminating the escrow account requirements, however, **the act will decrease future budget deficits—as measured by the unified federal budget—for 2007 through 2010,** and will increase deficits for 2011 through 2016.  Eliminating the requirement that the USPS maintain an escrow account for the savings from legislation enacted in 2003 will allow the Postal Service to increase spending for capital improvements or other projects, pay down its outstanding debt, postpone or diminish future rate increases, or some combination of these options   ------ Yea the Postal Employees actually prefer the current system.  It benefits to union negotiations for the pre-funding and the idea of canceling that prefunding has been brought up by the GAO in 2014, and Congress has worked to cancel it 3 previous times   It always is dropped from resistance from the retired postal service union  Postal Service Reform Act of 2016  Postal Service Reform Act of 2018  Postal Service Reform Act of 2019  ------ But back to the History of the actual USPS issue.

The shift in the mail mix from First-Class Mail to lower revenue-per piece classes has resulted in stagnant revenue growth and shrinking contribution. By 2008 1st Class Mail fell into a steep decline in  the Great Recession of 2008. From 2008 to 2010, First-Class Mail volume declined by 13.4 billion pieces.   * This decline persisted through 2010, beyond the official end of the recession.   As bad as the First-Class Mail decline was, it was dwarfed by the decline in Marketing Mail/Spam Mail. USPS had projected that, Standard Mail volume would have had to grow by 43.2 billion pieces by 2010 to help in revenue offsetting. Rather than increasing from 2008 to 2010, Standard Mail volume fell by 16.6 billion pieces.  * The 2008 recession was a true advertising depression. In 2008, Standard Mail volume declined by 4.3 percent, only slightly worse than the 3 percent decline in 2002 recession. Rather than recovering as it did in 2003, Standard Mail went into a nose dive, falling 16.8 percent more in 2009  Having lost First Class Mail in 2008, the USPS was dependent on Junk Mail post 2008 Recession.

Compatibiliists also believe, if I understand correctly, that humans are either free or they are not. I do not agree with that. I am saying that there's every possibility that humans are both free and not free simultaneously. And that possibility could exist in different forms. Perhaps it means people are partially free. Or perhaps it means that Free Will and Not Free Will are not true opposites. Or perhaps it means that they are different dimensions of something larger. I know what I'm saying is hard to understand. That's why I used the examples. You are right that the computer one is a poor one.  And I wasn't clear whether you were stating that autonomy is synonymous with free will. Since you reject the analogy of pouring water on someone, clearly you don't see them as the same. I think the equator analogy fits my view best. Regardless of the river analogy, and whether you can move side to side, on the equator if you go exactly down the line, you are going a straight line. You cannot deviate. However, that straight line is also a circle when looked at from a different dimension. Or an oval when looked at through another one. What I'm getting at is that free will and determinism are not necessarily the same measurement even if they are measuring the same thing."", ""Well for a start, your original definition of determinism is obviously incorrect because clearly every person has a will. But it states that they do not. You post is not even questioning whether people have will or not. You are questioning whether that will is free. For instance, if I pour a glass of water on your lap, I did that because I wanted to. That is my will. But was that decision free to make? That is the biggest problem with your original definitions.  Now, as to disproving your main argument, you seem to believe that because people's actions are predetermined, that they cannot also choose to do those actions. However, that is not necessarily the case. It is very common in the Americas and Europe to think that two opposites cannot coexist, cannot be partially true, or cannot be both false. However, often in life these are not the case. For example, is the equator a straight line or a circle? It is both. Are dogs dangerous or safe? Both. Neither.  It depends. Similarly, both Free Will and determinism can coexist. Here are some scenarios to help explain:  1) Perhaps life is like a river. You are forced to go down it, and you cannot fight the current so nothing you do will make you go down any slower. However, you do not need to fight the current to go side to side. So while your destination is predetermined, you are still making your own actions in some ways.   2) If you design a true AI, and then ask it whether it would like an apple, it chooses that apple for itself. But at the same time, you designed the programming that let it choose that apple, and you engineer the situation that gave it that apple. So in that way, even though it is a pure AI, it is not making its own choice. Yet, it is. So from its perspective, it does have free will, but from our perspective, it only has partial free will. One might say the same about god. From and overarching perspective, we have no free will, but from an individual perspective, we do.  3) There are consequences for the actions you do, if I were to pour water on your lap, what would be your response? You would probably yell at me and tell me not to do that. But why? If life is deterministic, by your argument I didn't have a choice in the matter. But clearly, I did.  4) Perhaps free will and determinism aren't reversible at all and perhaps that is a logical or mathematical fallacy. Perhaps they are related or dependent on each other, but not on the same scale. When one thing leads to another, that doesn't mean the reverse will also be true. For instance, if I said that all people would like to die rather than be brain dead, it is not also true that all people would like to live if they're not brain dead."", 'Why are you coming at this like determinism is the default option and free will needs to prove its existence? What logical argument is there that universe and everything in it is deterministic?']"

Same argument for ""convenient"": you could argue it is more convenient to do it as a baby compared to an adult, but this doesn\'t count if the adult just doesn\'t get piercings at all.   This has no value. If an adult didn\'t get pierced as a baby and wants to, they can; the opposite isn\'t really possible, as after 10 years of having them they\'ll take a lot to close and/or will leave visible scar tissue; not to mention people who end up with crooked piercings because they were done too young.', 'Not every adult wants pierced ears. By piercing them as a baby, the parent is depriving the child of the choice not to pierce them ever.', 'Yeah, most adult women have pierced ears, that doesn’t mean they wanted them since we are acknowledging that it’s often done when they’re quite young.

FWIW I had my ears pierced very young and a have a lot of other piercings and tattoos. The only one I wish I could take back is my ears. I hate them and I wish they weren’t pierced. The only way to “reverse” them is to go to a plastic surgeon and have them closed because they were done when I was a child. I don’t use them, I hate the way they look, and I don’t know if the scars incurred by fixing them is worth it.

Those are the benefits. Just because they clearly aren’t something you personally value doesn’t mean they don’t exist as benefits for other people.   I know that I’m glad I had mine pierced as a baby: I can’t remember any pain, and my parents were taking care of keeping them clean, so it wasn’t any bigger risk of infection than as an adult. As a matter of fact, at least I have those: I tried to get another helix piercing and half of them ejected because I developed an allergy at some point after childhood, and it took trial and error to find a replacement which was again, painful. Meanwhile, My sisters didn’t have theirs pierced and it was a bigger inconvenience and more pain for them. Especially because one had her piercing that she paid for as an adult with her own money end up rejecting that one, which seems to be more common for anyone over age 11.\nj17a962\tchangemyview\tj179zva\tzsbfhe\t20221222\t0\tOrionExalted\tAnakin Skywalker literally becomes Darth Vader and suppresses the Galaxy in part because of his love for a woman.

Les choses que tu dis n'auraient jamais été acceptés pour personne.  Je le trouve ridicule que tu peux utiliser ça comme un argument s'il n'y a pas d'outrage. C'est plus ridicule que ton argument est de dire que les gouvernements élus démocratiquement ont supprimé ça. Pour moi c'est contradictoire. Les québécois sont un peuple fier mais à même temps ils sont un peu de soumis. Dis-moi comment est-ce que ce que tu dis fait du sens ?    C'est une excuse, c'est ce que tu dis. Si le fédéral avait triché, et les séparatistes avaient évidence ils pouvaient faire quelque chose. Je ne sais pas si t'as réalisé mais c'est impossible d'argumenter en contre de toi. Il y a une explication pour tout sans importance s'ils sont ridicules et irréalistes.    C'est trop mal pour eux, mais le fédéral est correct. Ford et Smith sont un peu d'imbéciles et ils veulent détruire le système de la santé. Tu pense seulement au Québec. Moi, je penses au Canada, et je suis d'accord que le fédéral doivent imposer conditions. C'est les premiers qui sont en faute de cet embarrass avec Covid. En tous les cas c'était Trudeau qui devais intervenir, en Alberta et en Ontario, parce que Ford et Kenney ne savaient pas comme gérer la situation. C'est mal pour Québec, mais trop mal nous sommes partis d'une fédération. C'est comme ça que les choses fonctionnent.    Bien, je suis désolée. J'étais incorrect. Mais, je ne comprends pas pourquoi les immigrants sont une chose pour les séparatistes. Si on décide de déménager au Québec sans français on aura une mauvaise expérience, même dans Montréal.   C'est une stupidité complète de faire ça, et les nouvelles lois l'ont fait plus difficile, chose avec laquelle je n'ai pas de problème. Même si la plupart qui viennent ici apprendre.  Pour conclure ces statistiques m'indique qu'il y à plus gens qui parle les deux langues au lieu d'un. Pourquoi est-ce que c'est mauvais ?  C'est comme j'avais dis, c'est pas sur le français, c'est sur le séparatisme et son manque de pertinence. Les séparatistes vont a créer tous les homes de pailles pour dire que la culture québécoise va disparaître, mais c'est pas ça qui va disparaître, c'est le séparatisme. La culture québécoise n'est pas en recul, elle change et évolue, les séparatistes ont peur parce qu'elles n'ont pas un lieu dans cette nouvelle culture. Ces sont les gens comme moi qui seront là face du Québec a l'avenir, pas les bêtes comme Parizeau ou PSPP."", ' C\'est pas assez. Je veux évidence irréfutable, pas d\'articles et des opinions. Ça ne marche pas pour moi. Sinon, c\'est pas différent des choses que Trump et ses partisans font quand ils disent que leur élection avait été volé. La spéculation sur gouvernements libéraux élus démocratiquement ne m\'intéresse pas. Si tu me vas dire qu\'ils ont triché aussi, ne t\'embêté pas. Tes arguments ne sont pas valides. Tu ne peux pas juste venir ici, dire que le ""non"" a volé le referendum et que leurs gouvernements ont supprimé le mouvement de l\'indépendance.  J\'ai besoin de plus qu\'articles et choses qu\'un juge avait dit. En plus, il n\'y a pas d\'outrage, si les choses que t\'as dites étaient vraies, la société québécoise n\'aurait jamais accepté ça. Ce que tu dis est impossible, et si c\'est un point commun des souverainistes, il sera moins possible de que je leur donne mon soutien. On ne peut pas simplement nier le choix des gens, et le choix dans 1995 était ""non"". Si tu veux une autre referendum, bien, tu peux exiger ça, mais tu ne peux jamais dire que les choix des gens sont invalides à cause de spéculation des articles.   Oui, et c\'est pour ça que le Québec à pouvoir pour changer ces décisions, en plus d\'avoir un parti fédéral, chose que les autres provinces n\'ont pas. Je suis désolée, mais ces choses sont les conditions pour être partie du Canada, chose que le Québec avait décidé de faire dans 1980 et 1995. C\'est la loi, si tu ne l\'aimes pas, chiale aux autres québécois qui ont décidé de rester au Canada.   C\'est trop mal pour toi, parce que les traites sont avec le fédéral, pas avec Québec, et les autochtones ont dit maintes et maintes fois qu\'ils ne vont pas négocier avec Québec.   Dis-le dans la rue, alors. Quel est le problème ? Si tu ne le trouves pas acceptable à le dire comme ça, pourquoi est-ce qu\'il est acceptable de le dire dans un débat télévisé en face d\'un femme noire ? Est-ce que les politiciens séparatistes ont carte blanche à dire ce qu\'ils veulent ?   Quel est le problème ici ? Est-ce que c\'est impossible de trouver un compromis ? Legault parait qu\'il est ouvert à ça, non ?  Honnêtement, je suis fini. Si tu ne vas pas donner évidence valide pour dire que le fédéral a volé l\'élection, alors ces sont mensonges, mensonges qui ont le même caractère que les mensonges de Trump.  C\'est la même chose avec le n-word, tu ne peux pas attendre que j\'accepte ton explication si tu vas me dire que c\'est incorrecte de dire le n-word dans la rue, mais pas dans un débat télévisé où il y a une femme noire.  C\'est assez, il n\'y aura jamais un compromis entre moi et les séparatistes. Je voterai toujours contre eux. Leur cause ne m\'a pas donné une bonne raison de penser qu\'ils savent que c\'est ce qu\'ils font. Tes arguments moins.  Je ne vois pas une voie ou je serai d\'accord avec l\'indépendance. Ce mouvement est un poison, et c\'est plein de fanatiques.', "" C'est la nature de ces choses, t'as ton point de vue et j'ai le mien, mais peut-être, il y a un compromis. Je continuerai cette conversation en français, et nous nous comprendrons dans la langue du Québec.    Plus évidence. Je ne crois pas qu'un article de 2013 et une affirmation d'un juge sont assez pour dire que le referendum était invalide.  Non, c'est pas assez, si tu vas dire ces choses, to dois avoir évidence qui le confirme 100%. Comprends-tu ce que tu dis ? C'est une accusation sérieuse et si les choses étaient comme ça, alors, j'aurais attendu à un outrage. La société québécoise n'aurait jamais accepté ça.    Dans les médias anglos. Qu'est-ce que tu vas dire ? Que ça ne compte pas ? Pourquoi pas ? Non, c'est complètement raciste. Il y avait un million d'autres choses à dire et PSPP avait choisi de dire le n-word et de forcer à une autre personne a le dire aussi. Les deux chefs séparatistes l'ont dit, en face d'une femme noire, en plus du monde entier. Plus tu combats ce point, moins je fais confiance à ce mouvement. Il y a 0 justifications pour ce comportement, 0. C'est pas une chose culturelle, non, on ne dit jamais le n-word, et ce n'est pas une chose anglaise. Si tu penses d'autre manière, je mets au défi d'aller dire ça au milieu de la rue.  En France, on ne peut pas dire ces choses, moins à Montréal. Il n'y a aucune raison pourquoi je devrais accepter ce type de choses dans un débat télévisé.    Oui, c'est pas facile pour moi. J'aime le Québec, plus que mon ancien pays. Québec c'est chez-moi. Je ne veux pas avoir à choisir entre eux, et les séparatistes ne comprennent pas la difficulté de ces choses pour nous, les immigrants. Il y a plusieurs personnes que disaient de choses méchantes pour nos choix. Nous n'avons pas choisi d'être insérés dans ce conflit, mais nous recevons les balles des deux côtés. Oui, il y a des anglos imbéciles qui viennent à dire choses tout le temps, spécialement quand on défend aux québécois et au Québec. Ils ont beaucoup à dire aussi. Par exemple, je suis d'accord que le serment au roi est une stupidité. Un imbécile anglo m'avait dit que c'était temps pour moi de sortir du Canada, et que si on était dans les temps anciens, ils m'auraient viré sans problème et qu'il n'aurait pas de problème avec ça.   La seule chose que j'exige est respect. On peut croire ce qu'on veut, mais je ne comprends pas pourquoi je devrais supporter des choses comme ça.    Non, jamais, nous sommes Canadiens, pas Américains. C'est pas la même  chose de toute façon. Si le Québec sorti, Canada ne sera jamais le même chose. En plus, sais-tu les implications de ça ? Il y a plusieurs complications comme les disputes de territoire avec les autochtones, le St. Laurent, les traitres de commerce avec les [États-Unis](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/u-s-wouldn-t-have-recognized-quebec-independence-in-wake-of-yes-vote-in-1995-1.1730253). C'est un cauchemar social, économique et politique pour tout le monde.   Quand les séparatistes attendent mon soutien, ils attendent que je suis à faveur de potentiellement détruire le Canada. Ça n'arrivera jamais, pas pour moi.    Je ne sais pas, pourquoi est-ce que tu continues de faire référence à ce thème si t'as cette opinion ?    C'est pas vrai. Je suis immigrant, et je sais comme le système fonctionne. Tu ne peux pas immigrer au Québec de la même manière que le reste du Canada. Si tu fais ça, tu devrais traiter avec le gouvernement Québécois et t'as besoin de suivre leurs procédures. Si tu ne connais pas le français, bonne chance, tu ne vas pas rester au Québec. En plus, c'est pas assez d'obtenir autorisation du gouvernement québécois, tu devrais traiter avec le fédéral aussi.  Le Québec a beaucoup de pouvoir pour choisir leurs immigrants, plus que les autres provinces.    Ouais, et rappelle une chose, j'ai choisi de faire ça. Ma langue maternelle est l'espagnol, ils ne parlent pas français à mon ancien pays. J'ai fait ça avant d'arriver au Canada, qui est 130% plus que tous les autres immigrants, et en plus que les Canadiens eux-mêmes qui rarement parlent français.    J'ai choisi le Québec et Montréal comme chez-moi, pas Toronto et l'Ontario, pas Calgary et l'Alberta, et pas Vancouver et la Colombie-Britannique. C'est beaucoup d'exiger que mon opinion soit respecté ? Je ne suis pas un colonisateur, un partisan qui suivre les ordres du fédéral ou un envahisseur qui vient à supprimer la culture québécoise.   Je pense que t'es raisonnable. Ne pense pas tu, que c'est injuste quand les autres séparatistes disent ces choses méchantes ?

I mean “evolution is just a theory like the theory of gravity, oxygen theory, the germ theory of disease, or the theory about the shape of the Earth” does pretty much convey what I’m trying to say. I already said that we know the theory of gravity isn’t absolutely true and we also know that there’s a high possibility that all of these others will have some small mistakes that have been overlooked by practically everyone, but just treating the ideas as “best guess based on what we know so far” we just run into the opposite problem.  Then it turns into “you and I just interpret the same evidence differently.” How do you know it’s the best explanation so far? Doesn’t that require that you know that it’s more accurate (“factual”) than the other ideas put forth?   That’s why I said that it’s a fact that evolution happens and that it’s a fact that when we observe evolution happening that the theory describes what we observe. Mutations, heredity, genetic drift, selection, the whole bit. The theory may not be absolutely correct in every regard but it seems to be pretty damn close as we don’t find the same types of inconsistencies with the theory of biological evolution as we do when we try to make the theory of gravity work on the quantum scale.   At this point it’s time to just stop beating around the bush. The current theory of biological evolution is the only theory that still stands. There are possible ways it could be wrong and the corrections will be made as they are discovered but it’s not like Intelligent Design or some alternative idea is even in the same playing field. We shouldn’t give credence to ideas that don’t deserve it. We don’t have to wait for absolute truth to consider an idea correct.   “Factual” in the colloquial sense applies to things like the theory of evolution, the theory of oxygen, and the law of gravity. In science we just reserve “fact” for points of data. Theories are always open to revision **even if no revision is required** because if they weren’t they’d have to be replaced or we’d stay wrong. They remain the best explanation for the evidence so far and that stays the case even if they’re never falsified because they aren’t false.  Another way to look at it without calling the theory itself factual would be to consider every aspect of the theory and all of the sub-theories that make it up, such as the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, and work out how many times the theory is built upon and backed by factual data. Now we don’t have to call the theory a fact but any replacement to it will still have to account for all of the same facts the current theory already accounts for and it’ll have to do it in such a way that doesn’t rely on ad-hoc fallacies and apologetic excuses. It’ll have to be something built from the evidence rather than altered simply to avoid being precluded by it.', ' Same with evolution', 'You can also say that the theory is factual, in the colloquial sense, being as observed evolution happens as the theory suggests it should. The theory is built from facts and it has led to many confirmed predictions and it’s about as close to a factually accurate description of biological evolution and how it works.   In science “fact” is more like a verified/demonstrated/observed data point but that doesn’t mean that theories aren’t all pretty much all factual to some degree. It’s a fact that evolution happens pretty much as the theory says it happens and not just that evolution happens at all.   Creationists have very little trouble accepting that evolution happens at all. It’s the explanation for how evolution happens, the evolutionary history or life, the concept of universal common ancestry, and how this *could* be extended to include a large portion of what we call “abiogenesis” considering how autocatalytic RNA molecules evolve and form spontaneously via ordinary physics and chemistry. The problem is when God is taken out of the equation. That’s why they treat science like it’s an atheist cult that a lot of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Taoists, etc. participate in. I’ve even had people tell me that science is just one giant conspiracy that the people trying to prove each other wrong don’t realize they are propagating.   It’s a fact that the theory of biological evolution is pretty damn factual. It’s also a fact that populations change. Creationists object to the first but they can’t hide from the second. It’s too obvious.  **Edit:** In terms of calling the theory “factual” I should reiterate this by stating that the theory describes how evolution happens and then when we watch evolution happen it’s the same as the theory describes. There may be some nuance or you could hypothetically say that there’s a god toying with us by creating things that only match our expectations when it comes to what we didn’t watch evolve. You could say we’ve been implanted with false memories when it comes to what we’ve observed.   You can make up all sorts of unfounded assumptions about what might really be going on that we only mistake as the theory providing an actual factual description of evolution, but outside of these unfounded assumptions you’ll see a one to one correlation between what the theory says happens and what observe happening. There’s always room for improvement and there’s always the hypothetical chance we’re wrong, but I had a rather drawn out discussion about how we can’t consider theories factual because that implies that we already found the absolute truth, or something along those lines.   To be clear, this was never my intention. The theory of evolution is one of the best supported theories in science. It’s the most hated by fundamentalists. It’s withstood over a century of scrutiny. It holds up. What it describes is what we see. It’s like the germ theory of disease, oxygen theory, or the the theory about the shape of our planet. It’ll always be the provisional truth just in case we’re wrong, but at this point in time there’s no reason to consider it a false explanation for how evolution occurs. It seems pretty accurate. As far as we can tell it provides a factual explanation. As such, it’s not too absurd to treat it as such.']

Inflated civilian casualties over many conflicts point to impractical tactics still being used.  Because the comment cited it as the first Iraq war I was thrown off and confused it with the 2003.   Either way, my point still is consistent as the gulf war (desert storm) had substantial civilian casualties.   The 1990-91 conflict was an invasion of Kuwait.

The point in that article is the media might not be giving enough attention to sexual abuse in schools, which is possibly true.

The subpoenas are among a dozen issued by the plaintiffs in that suit this week.  The lawsuit was filed in March by a coalition that includes the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and several individual voters who claim the congressional boundaries approved by the Legislature in 2021 violated the Utah Constitution. The suit names Lt. Gov. Diedre Henderson, the Utah Legislature, Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson, Utah Senate President Stuart Adams and the Legislature’s Redistricting Committee as defendants.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs refused to provide a copy of the subpoenas, saying they do not publicly release such documents during litigation.  A source familiar with the case, speaking on background, told The Salt Lake the subpoenas are seeking documents and other records relating to the drawing of the new maps during the redistricting process.  Odd: Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) just had to announce to the House (via the reading clerk) that he’s been served with a subpoena from the 3rd judicial district court of Salt Lake County and has not yet decided if he's going to comply with it...  — Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) December 22, 2022   A separate court filing requesting information from the Utah Legislature demonstrates what the plaintiffs seek. They’ve asked for draft maps that weren’t approved by lawmakers, including data and analyses related to those draft plans. Plaintiffs are also seeking any communications with current or former members of Congress or legislators and members of their staff and contacts with Gov. Spencer Cox and Lt. Gov. Diedre Henderson and their team.  Plaintiffs are also seeking any contacts between lawmakers and Adam Foltz, a Republican political operative who has played a role in Wisconsin’s 2010 redistricting process that federal judges slammed as “needlessly secret.” In 2021, Foltz was hired by Republicans in the Texas Legislature to help shepherd their redistricting efforts, The Texas Tribune reported.  Lawmakers have also been asked to provide records of any contact with Adam Kincaid, who heads up the National Republican Redistricting Trust, the GOP’s main mapmaking organization.  Other Utahns subpoenaed about the case include former congressman Rob Bishop, who served on the independent redistricting commission until he resigned in protest near the end of the process, former state Rep. Paul Ray, who co-chaired the Legislature’s redistricting committee and Rex Facer, who chaired the independent commission.  The subpoenas were issued after a Utah district judge refused a request by lawyers for the state to throw out the lawsuit.  In a separate court filing from earlier this month, lawyers for the plaintiffs complained lawmakers were hiding behind a claim of “legislative privilege” to avoid answering their questions.  “No Utah court has ever recognized a special ‘legislative privilege’ to refuse to engage in discovery in a civil case, especially when the Legislature and its members have been found to be proper parties,” the filing reads.  Last month, lawyers for the state asked the Utah Supreme Court to intervene and dismiss the case. That request is still pending."", 'Romney is not a real republican', ""We're not just talking about Utah though. We are talking about 49 other states as well.

You saying so does not make it so. Everything I wrote was correct, although it could be further expounded upon to provide more clarity. Furthermore, nothing I wrote contradicted itself, so I don't know were this idea is from.   I should have been more clear, I was talking about the slums you see in most of Africa and Asia, especially in India. Nobody actually owns the land the slums are on in any official or legal sense, nobody holds title to the land. What this means is that a person cannot seek any legal recourse for theft or damage, nor will anybody be punished for infringing on what the people own. This is why you see shacks built on top of or touching the shacks of others. A person cannot stop another from building on top of them or touching them, since they do not own their land. People cannot build nice homes or apartments in these places because they hold no title to land, meaning that it will be taken over by squatters before they can plan and construct something other than a basic shack. People cannot provide utilities to their homes for the same reason, having title means people tap into your power, water, sewage, etc. and you would have no legal recourse. There can be no planning and organization and vision for this area, since no land is secure and stable.   This is just not so. Capitalism is a system that recognizes private property and respects it, unfortunately, in many places there is no respect for private property and no protections for it, as in the case of the slums, where people have no legal or official title to land. Nobody recognizes the ownership of the land. There is a movement to help people in 3rd world countries get legal title to their lands so that they can seek recourse and protection, which is a great development."", ' There\'s no such thing as ""the owner"", nor is land being sold against anybody\'s will. Empty land has no owner, by every legal definition it reverts to the public or the commons after years of disuse or having never been used. This is the fundamental problem: capitalist ideology propagates disinformation, as if there\'s existential squares written on a map somewhere by political sanctity.  Ownership is a broad spectrum of Rights receding and proceeding over time, the only issue are ""claims"" when it comes up in the judicial system. The state does not actually sell land, it sells deeds and titles. Land is just the surface of the earth and it doesn\'t move.  Here\'s an example of the contradiction:   Of course they do, ownership is established by law everywhere in the occupancy of land.   They do hold title to the land, hence the effort to formalize that as you mentioned later.   That\'s because their government is weak, and doesn\'t have any normal means to prosecute what you\'ve just described. It\'s not because of lacking some weirdly existential ""title"". By any normal customary use of land, each shack has a ""curtilage"" which extends the zone of dominion from the structure etc.  You\'re telling me that free concerts when people put down their blankets, it\'s normal to edge my space right up to yours and intrude on your enjoyment. It\'s definitely NOT normal, and concertgoers tend to complain to each other if somebody was parked too close.   If we live in a culture that\'s founded on disrespect and nobody cares, then it might look like a third world slum. You need a magical fetish to ""make"" it be title, even though all titles derive from possession at some point.    There\'s rowhouses and apartment dwellings in every modern city, but I doubt you\'d question the title of real estate in that instance.   That is completely wrong, people are not assigned the existential ownership of land in any case. You believe in a false god here, called ""deed trespassing"". All trespass consists of invading actual space or constructively belonging to another. The development of slums in the third world is happening according to the customary standard of that area, and it would be the same if legal title was recognized to build row houses and condos. Everything would touch, and get built right on top of each other like in every other Urban environment.   Notice you cannot define that property, which doesn\'t appear to be private either. I\'m talking about constant sales of land, which results in the development of vacant areas or their reversion to public use. All titles are subject to all other claims anyway, so it\'s just a method of selling off the public domain.  That\'s how tax sales work, there\'s no guarantee that deed has any efficacy or merchantability for any purpose. It\'s just selling off the potential of state dominion, and then you have to work it out in the Civil environment. The land described may not even exist, and this is publicly disclaimed by every tax authority.   Of course they do, it\'s all context to the environment.', "" This was my misunderstanding then. I thought you were talking about reselling all land, not just vacant lands.      Nobody actually owns the land the slums are on in any official or legal sense        Of course they do, ownership is established by law everywhere in the occupancy of land.  This is not a contradiction. In much of the world, people are technically living on land illegally, as much of the land is owned by the government or has no official claim, which is why governments routinely engage in slum clearing operations, bulldozing the slums or why they can forcibly relocate these people. Furthermore, a large number of people cannot go to court to defend their property or seek protection from the government because they don't have legal ownership. Governments don't recognize the property of hundreds of millions of people around the world, meaning they don't legally own the land.      They do hold title to the land, hence the effort to formalize that as you mentioned later.  People actually do not hold title to the land the live on in much of the world. It is simple and easy to look this up. In many of the poorest countries, almost all land is owned by the government, with large populations technically being squatters. Only about 30% of the population worldwide has actual title to their lands. There is a reason there is constant conflict over land in places like Africa, there is a reason people don't invest in their property, it is because they hold no legal title.   I am not talking about hypotheticals from countries with property rights, I am talking about actual practices around the world, where private property is rare and protections are weak.      There's rowhouses and apartment dwellings in every modern city, but I doubt you'd question the title of real estate in that instance.  This is completely different and has nothing to do with what I was talking about, therefore irrelevant.   Townhouses and Row houses are very different from slums and are able to be developed because of private ownership of land. It should be obvious the differences between a slum with no property ownership and a townhouse or row house and how these come to be developed.    I don't think you understand how property works. Simply living on land does not make it yours. Having title to land certifies that it is yours and allows you to legally force someone off your land and gives you the right to go to court to protect land since you have proof that it is yours.""]"

I have myself back more than ever in my entire life, although I have lost almost everything, my life is simple and humble and beautiful in many ways, I spend a lot of time outdoors and I am fit and heathy and strong.  I also feel DEEP contentment and satisfaction, I KNOW my purpose as a man in this life, and what I must do and what I must become. I feel peace within myself and trust in the world, in life itself.  I can appreciate that YOU had such an experience, and truly I'm sorry that you did. And that you suffered.  But whatever conclusions YOU came to about your own story.... What I speak of IS real, as is the ever deepening of my knowing, there is nothing wobbly about it that is at risk of falling apart...  There is a chance you have repressed trauma within yourself, a strong focus on body based awareness and theraputic modalities (TRE, somatic therpay, somatic experiencing) will help you ground and digest such experiences in a way that does not lead to you losing yourself in such a way as you allude to.  During my process of remembering, absolutely there were times I feared I was losing my mind. For example when I relived memories of also being raped in the military as a grown man, for a few days I lived in paranoia-fear that EVERYONE I'd ever know had once raped me.  *(It also didn't help that unbeknownst to me at the time, the woman who is now my ex, a covert/vulnerable narcisisist, a modern day wicked witch was covertly abusing me while I was reliving hell.)*  *(It is far more difficult to remember and to heal when we are surrounded by such parasitic-narcs... So if you're struggling check your six for one.)*  But because I was grounded in my body, and come to know what truth feels like... So I rode out that particular storm... And so once the shockwaves settled, I was left with a few names and faces of old colleagues that stood out and who I had strangely and compeltely forgotten up until that point. Data points that had resonance within my body, horrifying as it was.  The body is the grounding rod, and what I lean upon first and foremost, NOT the mind, as the mind can be easily confused or even fractured or broken.  Also that you are making such assertions, without even watching the video... I.e. not doing your due dilligence, is lacking on your part.  And as a result you project your own experience onto me, and inaccurately so at that.  I wish you all the best, and I do not think we will have any further/fruitful conversation, so I also wish you farewell.""]"

They withheld this critical infor\xadmation from the commanders in Hawaii, who might have headed off the attack or prepared themselves to defend against it. Why? Because the impending attack constituted precisely what they had been seeking for a long time. Secretary of War Stimson even wrote in his diaries:  _""The question was how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.” After the attack, Stim\xadson confessed that “my first feeling was of relief … that a crisis had come in a way which would unite all our people._  This is evil, pure and simple.

Their defeat in border skirmishes with the Soviets and Mongolians solidified this policy (Nanshin-ron) over trying to conquer Siberia (Hokushin-ron).   The diplomatic moves you mention unfold against the backdrop of a decade of relentless Japanese aggression in Asia and the Pacific. First the unprovoked invasion of China, brutality like the Rape of Nanking, then the conquest of French Indochina and the declaration of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.   The latter two made it clear conflict was inevitable, which is why the US started responding so forcefully to Japan.    No, they knew an attack was coming, but they didn’t know precisely where or when. There wasn’t any way to prepare for it beyond generally increasing readiness. In fact, this is why USS *Lexington* wasn’t at Pearl Harbor; she was delivering aircraft to Midway to strengthen the island’s defenses.  And you’re ignoring the simultaneous attacks Japan launched on American territories in the Pacific.

Most importantly though they don't name said study nor reference it, that is ALWAYS shady.  Secondly divorces are not how one defines a relationship, people can have all kinds of different types of relationships and marriage far from is on everyone's mind.   Now let's address your other source and what it ACTUALLY SAYS, reading comprehension and checking sources are very important for that.   *Source 2,   Special report, Nonfatal Domestic Violence, 2003–2012.   Published April 2014, written by Jennifer L. Truman, Ph.D., and Rachel E. Morgan, Ph.D., BJS Statisticians.*   http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf  It means they are more likely to be abused by an intimate partner in comparison to either immediate family or another relative.  From the study,    An intimate partner includes **current or former** spouses, boyfriends, and girlfriends.   Immediate family includes parents, children, and siblings.    Quoted from the study,     Lastly from what I read from the publication that's the case for domestic violence not general abuse....  Which is also what the The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) is specifically talking about. In other words they are only comparing between these 3 categories intimate partner, immediate family, other relative.   So the only thing that bullet point on their websites says is that for 18-24 year old women are more likely to experience domestic abuse by the hands of an intimate partner in comparison to immediate family or another relative.  Now the claim you are making is not supported by your source and definitely not the source they refer to. Because that data isn't available in that report ....   So instead of making nonsense claims based on what I assume misinterpretation of data, maybe fix your prejudice/bias and read it properly instead of assuming. Because your statistics don't prove or show what you claimed ;)  If those statistics did say that then on average, yes age gaps would inherently pose issues/complications.  Finally no you never mentioned specific ages. However specific ages were very clearly written in OPs meme (22 and 30s) and should thus be assumed as the default ages in this topic unless you clearly address specific ages, which you did not.  So you're not acknowledging statistics you're misinterpreting them, likely because of assumptions that you have about behavioural patterns that you might have experienced anecdotally which is why we don't use personal experiences for statistics. Again you made assumptions probably influenced by biases you have."", ' Do you not know what word ""inherently"" means?

Divorce is 18% more likely for couples with a five-year age difference. This rises to 39% for a 10-year age difference, and when the couple has a 20-year age gap, the likelihood of divorce rises to 95%. A\xa030-year age difference\xa0means a whopping 172% chance of divorce.  [Women between the ages of 18-24](https://ncadv.org/STATISTICS) are most commonly abused by an intimate partner. Physical, mental, and sexual and reproductive health effects have been linked with intimate partner violence including adolescent pregnancy.   How have I been inconsistent? For the bazillionth time, **I\'m not saying that age gap relationships are inherently predatory**. Only that statics have repeatedly shown that certain issues are far more prevalent as age gaps often reflect an imbalance of power and therefore leave young people open to coercion or abuse.\xa0This isn\'t unique to sexual or romantic relationships either.   I\'ve spent time in Europe as well.    I never tried to equate the two, and I\'m not referring to 22 or 23. Please read though my previous comments.   I\'m referring to older adults who purposefully pursue barely legal teens and very young adults because they know they\'re less likely to instill boundaries, due to their lack of life experience.

474	69	474_obsolescence_products_technology_tech	['obsolescence', 'products', 'technology', 'tech', 'planned', 'product', 'manufacturers', 'technologies', 'fridge', 'consumers']	"[""No, it's accurate. Longevity is a goal mark in many proposals we receive. A proposal is the criteria thresholds manufacturers would like to achieve.   Very often, products would like to meet a use scenario of X quantity. This is usually in excess of what consumers would use the item.     For example, many washing machine manufacturers would like to hit a usability of around 1500 loads of laundry at a minimum. With many EU and US regional models having PRLs around twice that. That would be around 3x that average number of uses for that product yearly.   When manufacturers fall short of these proposals, they redesign the product usually. Like Samsung did when LG started making better models.   Some things are designed to be cheap/disposable. Yes. To be frank, it is obviously so too.   Such as many Sony loud speakers are very cheaply made and sold at a way lower price point than other products from, say Mackie, Fluence or Klipsch.   However, it is accurate to say many people not familiar with product testing and research have a somewhat fantastical view of planned obsolescence.    A Ninja blender being sold for $100 that does10 things is not the same product as a $800 Vitamix. A cosumer may just think they are two blenders, but that's not the way to look at it."", 'The average is around 300 loads a year in the US (I live and work in the US, but this varies by region). They shoot for a 5 year duration, 1500, and often double or triple that in the PRL. After a certain point, the engineers predict the product is unlikely to fail if it hasn\'t failed in 1500 cycles, hours uses, etc.   Certain models are made at different price points, sizes, and regulation standards by region. Often, they can\'t use X or Y components from one model to the next.  This partly is why they have different criteria per product or model for testing.  Most products will fail early in their use cycle, if at all. Generally,  manufacturers would like to not have to replace products or have their brand perceived to be low quality.   Most things will fail in time. Even ""old"" stuff made back in the day, so to speak, will eventually fail. Many of them did in their day as well- it\'s just a bias your grandma\'s old stove didn\'t break down, or your grandpa\'s old Monte Carlo ran perfectly for decades. That\'s the reality of physics, friction, material wear &amp; tear, etc.   Sometimes manufacturers don\'t care about longevity, absolutely yes.   Some products are made cheaply or quickly and not meant to last decades. Though many products are not desired to be cheap or low quality as they hurt the product brand or consumer confidence in the manufacturer.   Testing is done by customers/consumers in real scenarios when possible. The manufacturers like to test in phases; lab test, home use test, observed use, focus testing, etc.   Vitamix, Kitchenaid, Staub, AllClad, Breville Le Creuset, Matfer, Global, OXO, for example, all make kitchen related products that the engineers try to make as durable and long last as possible. Their PRLs are pretty hefty.   But even so, Le Creuset or Oxo also makes cheaper stuff at lower price points. This is made less durable, cheaper.   It\'s not accurate to say, ""Le Cresuset builds stuff to last generations,"" as is often claimed.    Planned obsolescence does happen. Though not to the degree often misunderstood or exaggerated by general consumers for a number of reasons not related to the actual products at times.', 'Well, the OP had cookware that cost thousands of bucks. As an example of ""long lasting"" products. Yeah, and they still make that cookware today, and yes, it will last generations. It will cost significantly.   That\'s just the reality of physics. It takes a lot to engineer products that last for a long time, usually. Not all these things are equal either.  A cast iron skillet is a relatively simple product. Technology might change the offerings of refrigerators, washing machines, or cellphones much more than a pan or light bulb.   I have old flip phones in the garage that still ""work."" But one might upgrade their phone for new features, form factor, newer hardware, etc.   When I was young we had an old fridge handed down from my grandmother that ran ""fine"". We upgraded to a new fridge with features such as an ice maker, a water dispenser, and so on. The old fridge went into the basement as a spare.   Many products cut corners in the service of greed, naturally. Though, quality products are still made today as in the past.  There were likely a lot of fridges of the same model type as my grandmother\'s old fridge that didn\'t last as long. Pointing to the one that didn\'t fail and assuming they all ran for decades without error is a bias.   There are factors like more things being made out of plastic, product complexity, user familiarity, and many items being more difficult to repair or service by laymen that feeds that bias as well.   My grandfather was a musician and made acoustic guitars. He also repaired them - people had high quality, expensive guitars, and cheap ones that needed more or less repairs back in the 60s and 70s as today.   My dad was a car mechanic. Cars broke down in the 70s and 80s.   My uncle owned a furniture repair business. Furtiniute broke down in the 60s and 70s, too.  The surviving products are not always indictive of greater attention to longevity than today. There is more to it than that. This is why I said earlier that consumers have an overexaggerated sense of ""planned obsolescence.""   Planned obsolescence is real. But that doesn\'t mean all products are such and a lot of them are made to last. But you might not find a saucepan sold at $10 will last the same as a $1000 Mauviel saucepan either.']"

If that’s your view, then say that. Many people, myself included, focused on the relation to YouTube because that’s what your title and most of your responses focused on. You can have a more general discussion on nudity if you want, just be more upfront with it.   I guess the analogy feels weird to me, because dancing is an activity that many people may never do or do so rarely as to not seriously interact with, and it is usually done with other people. Nudity, on the other hand, is a state that people experience with their own bodies every day, constantly, but privately, without others around. Rather than nudity, if feels like “sex” would be the more accurate replacement for dancing in your analogy:   I know that’s not what you mean, though. You are explicitly advocating for de stigmatizing non-sexual nudity. But the existence of so many sexual related things *off* of mainstream websites like Facebook and YouTube show that taboo and stigma are not enough to cause this stifling of creative, interesting content.

So, all that to say, if we are missing creative opportunities with non-sexual nudity, it’s probably not the fault of social media choosing not to promote it.

As Paul says when sin increased grace increased all the more and Paul should know. He called himself ""chief of sinners"" because of the time he spent hunting and murdering Christians.  The problem is that twisting scripture in small ways can lead to disastrous outcomes. This exact thing has happened with many scriptures. Where this conversation was going was ""well we\'re all sinners so does [this] sin even matter?"" Views that make light of sin always lead to sin .It\'s been the same discussion for almost 2 thousand years now. ""Well wouldn\'t more sin mean more grace?"" Paul responds to this in Romans 6.  What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 2 By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 3 Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.  Notice the exclamation mark after by no means. It\'s not very common in scripture. The words are very strong in the greek.   Anyone who would wish to be a Christian must understand the danger of sin and choose a life of fighting to be free of it by the spirit. Scripture tells us that those who take sin lightly either don\'t understand the high price that was paid for redemption or don\'t appreciate it anyway (hebrews 10:29) and will lose the grace given to them. Christ paid a high price with his own blood and suffering. The word excruciating was created to describe the unimaginable pain of literally tearing your body apart as you fight to take a breath (the cross actually kills by asphyxiation). He gave everything to put an end to sin. He expects people to respect the gravity of the situation   But yes all sin can be redeemed but twisting scripture to make certain sins look less dangerous only leads to dangerous places. If you want to know more the Book of 1 John that was half about this subject to address a similar lie that was putting greek believers in danger. Basically greeks had found a round about way of saying that if you sin it\'s really just you\'re body doing it and your not guilty of anything.

It\'s the same problem. A lot of these bootcamps (to my knowledge) teach javascript based frameworks which while useful, doesn\'t make sense for many employers. If I ran a dev agency or software company, I\'d be equally skeptical of a dev fresh out of a bootcamp. ""Oh, cool, you learned react in 6 months.

Your depiction of this strawman bootcamp sure sounds like a scam, but pointing out counter-examples can\'t really disprove this strawman argument without a more specific example.  I\'m talking about any camp that claims to get people sustainable high paying work quickly. Maybe some of these camps are really good at networking but my experience has been devs that can\'t keep up lose their job and any junior making 75k+ is likely to be seen as disposable.      Not all bootcamps are ”0 XP to $75k in 6 months"". Not sure if this is in line with your question given my previous point, but I do think there\'s value in bootcamps focusing existing knowledge to hirable skills.  There is absolutely value in focusing on hirable skills. My skepticism comes from the ads selling the salary vs the experience. It just seems like a red flag given most people going to those bootcamps don\'t even know basic html. Some camps maybe legit but many of the ads are an immediate turn off.']"

It's been a while since I researched this (as part of a uni course) but at least at the time the data shower worker coops to be equally or more efficient in the actual work, but fell short due to lack of capital availability (since banks were vary to lend to them and the owners of coops don't have the personal capital relationships available that capitalists generally do).   Also there were some loose data showing that coops also lose out because suppliers refuse to serve them either because of their own ideological grounds or because non coop competitors pressure the suppliers to refuse to supply the coops.   Also finally as someone that spent half a year studying nothing but worker cooperative regulations as part of my graduation work for law school , I can with confidence say that coop regulations are a hodge podge of incompetent lawmaking and outright sabotage of the firm model.   Hell here n sweden it was functionally impossible for coops to legally take out loans of any kind, untill just a few years ago when the law was amended.   Simply put, unless you harmonise all firm regulation and prohibit ideological denial of service then it's outright impossible to gauge coop efficiency contra ltd/sole owner firms efficiency.

Humans have a lot of attention biases, and I\'m sure you\'re paying more attention to those drivers who are going fast along with you than the ones who are going much slower in the right lane.  I\'ve been ticketed for going 72 in a 55, and I\'ve been ticketed for going 85 in a 70, both Ohio (I don\'t even live in Ohio lol). I don\'t speed &gt;5mph since I got hit by a car who was speeding recklessly, but I used to speed. I do a ton of regular interstate driving, although admittedly just around the MidWest. It\'s very possible that you live near a particular highway that\'s technically a 55 but functions like a 70mph highway.  On your average 55mph highway tho, it\'s definitely more dangerous to be going 80-85mph. On a 70mph highway, going 95-100mph is insane and reckless. I agree that some politicians need to hurry up on updating the speed limits on some rural intrastate highways, but saying that ""25-30mph over the limit"" is a safe rule of thumb is wrong and dangerous. Just slow down a little bit man, you\'re gonna get there just fine.', 'At this point, I literally don\'t understand what you\'re talking about.   You, earlier: ""A decent driver can easily go 10 to 15 MPH over without a substantial risk of an accident, and on a highway, that number just increases""  You said that it\'s safe to go more than 15mph on the highway. Most highways are 70mph. I don\'t get what you\'re trying to argue here.   Again, completely wrong. The study showed that the average person goes a little over 65 in a 55 **interstate highway**, not 70. This has nothing to do with your primary contention, which you STILL refuse to provide a source for: that the average driver regularly goes 10-15mph **on most roads**. I guess you can\'t find a source for it, unsurprisingly.  # The fact that people speed 11mph over the limit on one specific type of interstate highway does not in any way prove that it\'s SAFE to drive 10-15mph over on all roads.

At this point, I\'m convinced you\'re either trolling or the densest dude on Reddit. You really think people are more likely to be struck by lightning than killed in a car crash? In case you really need to know, the difference between lightning deaths vs vehicular deaths is \\~2000 vs 37,461. I\'m not gonna source that; if you need a source to know more people die by car than by lightning, then you need to go outside for once in your life.

Without diversifying writing, directing, and production staff, we increasingly see situations where new media is created with diverse characters written by the same old storytellers.   This has led to a situation (IMO) of almost surreptitious co-opting/colonization of diverse characters.   This is especially true when people call out the lack of diversity in shows where lack of diversity may be an important context.   An example: there was some criticism of the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, a show focused on affluent Jews in 1950s NYC, for not featuring a diverse cast expected from NYC-based shows. However, the push for the white show creators to just write some POC characters is both baffling in terms of appropriate representation of POC narratives but also because the lack of POC visibility is absolutely in-keeping with the perspective of the protagonists. It actually *tells* us something about racism and segregation and ethnic insularity that there *isn’t* diversity in the show - shoehorning it in provides a sense that the characters being presented had awareness, consciousness, or sympathies that may be ahistorical and subsequently produce a whitewashed outcome solely designed to comfort modern viewers.  So I’d say that even with original characters, story should rule - white creators are often not the best people to write non-white characters and not every setting is an appropriate context for the inclusion of diversity that obfuscates the reality of the experiences of “diverse people”.   We shouldn’t encourage diversity in every story, we should encourage more support for diverse creators who will naturally create more diverse work.', 'There are a diversity of good ideas and a diversity of bad ones.']"

The existence of atoms is a means to an end, and the existence of life is just a byproduct. It\'s selecting for the amount of black holes which is akin to reproduction. Cosmological natural selection is testable, just not with our current technology. As of current experiments, it remains within the margin of error, not provable or falsifiable. I would change my mind if someone came up with another explanation for how/why the constants have the values they do that is falsifiable, which as of yet I have not seen. The standard model/relativity, or even String theory/loop quantum gravity all fail to do this. They have the constants as free parameters which must be added in via measurement.  I think it may be likely that this is a simulation, but again that\'s untestable. As of now, cosmological natural selection is the only theory that explains the fine tuning of the constants that produces testable predictions. Personally, I think that we may be in a simulation created by some civilization which itself lives inside a black hole, but no conceivable experiment could test this. Simulation theory is really akin to a religion (one could call the creators of simulation ""God,"" although it could just as easily be some dude in his basement or a flying spaghetti monster).  The simulation hypothesis doesn\'t really fix the fine tuning problem, because you still end up with the issue of how the simulated entities ended up in a universe that allows for their structure. Same with invoking ""God"", which leads to the question of where ""God"" came from.', ""Fine tuning could just be to maximize structure. It doesn't necessarily imply intelligent design. It could imply, for example, that cosmic inflation must obey the 2nd law of thermodynamics and select states which maximize entanglement during the selection of the constants. It could also imply natural selection, although I imagine you wouldn't like that since you don't like the idea of multiple universes or differing values of the constants (because?)  I guess I am making the assumption that the values could be different, because I have no reason to assume that they are or aren't different, but them having multiple values maxes it easier to explain why a configuration with as much structure as ours is possible.  I don't see what additional phenomena can be explained by assuming they have to have the values they do. Do you have an example of a phenomenon that is explained by there being exactly one fixed set of values?  there are a number of other things in physics (quarks for example) which are unobserved and currently unfalsifiable, but which make observed phenomena much easier to explain and thus are accepted.  How is it falsifiable that the constants could have only one value?   also, why/how are you attached to the idea that there's exactly one universe?"", ""It's stable and structured, but has a period in the beginning/middle with stars and planets and galaxies. The vast majority of combinations of the free parameters in the standard model would give the same cooling soup the whole time (or a bunch of black holes).

If the gravitational constant was too high, or there was too much dark matter, it would be just black holes.

I\'m going to poke around again for the time frame.    Found this interesting bit: ""The proximate causes of most crashes are human behaviors including speeding, inattention, tailgating, impairment, improper passing, disobeying a signal, failing to yield right-of-way, or other infractions.""    This is a half truth, at best. Proximate causes can include equipment failure, road conditions, weather, sunrise/sunset blindness, etc.    But it also overlooks the fact that an accident can be a combination of behaviors of both drivers in a two car collision, or that someone can be in an accident where THE OTHER DRIVER IS SOLELY at fault. There was no information in here, that I recall seeing that accounted for the fact that two car\'s worth of drivers and passengers (and pedestrians) could have received emergency car for the same collision, and how the numbers might be skewed to account for who is at fault. (Eg. Car #1 with one vaccinated driver pulls out of a parking lot without checking the road first, and causes a car with 1 unvaxxed driver and two unvaxxed passengers to swerve and crash, while winging an unvaxxed pedestrian. All the unvaxxed people get care, while the vaxxed driver at fault is not recorded because he did not suffer injury.)    Found another nugget: It appears they pulled all the records as of July 31, 2021, so presumably the 30 day window was around that date. Over half the records available were excluded. Some, as previous commenters noted, were people who were dead, non-residents, etc. But a whopping 12% of those omitted were omitted for having ""no activity in the prior year"". IOW, if they were healthy enough to have avoided seeing a medical practioner in their home province, they were excluded.     More fun facts. Questionable ways of accounting for those that ""died at the scene"" and therefore were excluded and for those who may have been vaccinated subsequently:    §7 Accounting for Scene Deaths The study examined serious traffic crashes based on emergency care throughout the region and thereby did not include deaths at the scene. In turn, we considered extreme assumptions to examine how results might change based on these missing deaths. Specifically, traffic statistics for this setting (602 total deaths in Ontario, 2018) suggested that 50 total deaths might have occurred in our study during follow-up (602/12). Taking into account the 8 deaths that were included, therefore, we estimated potentially 42 total deaths at the scene (50−8). Making an extreme assumption and assigning all these deaths to the vaccinated group yielded minimal changes to final results. In particular, the observed event count increased from a total of 5000 crashes to 5042 crashes, equivalent to an absolute risk of 535 per million (rather than 530 per million). This observed absolute risk was still substantially lower than the observed risk of 912 per million in the unvaccinated group. These results suggested that extreme assumptions about the deaths at the scene make minimal difference to final estimates of relative risk. §8 Accounting for Later Vaccinations The study examined vaccination status based on records on July 31, 2021 and did not include possible later vaccination that might have eventually occurred. In turn, we retrieved information on these subsequent vaccinations and considered extreme assumptions to examine how results might change based on the crossover cases. Specifically, we found 219,740 individuals who were eventually vaccinated from the cohort of 1,8450,290 who had been classified as unvaccinated. These individuals accounted for 155 total traffic crashes during follow-up. Making an extreme assumption and assigning all individuals to the vaccinated group yielded minimal changes to final results. In particular, the observed event count increased from a total of 5000 crashes to 5155 crashes, equivalent to an absolute risk of 534 per million (rather than 530 per million). This observed absolute risk was still substantially lower than the recalculated risk of 939 per million in the unvaccinated group. These results suggested that extreme assumptions about possible eventual vaccination during follow-up make minimal difference to final estimates of relative risk.']"

People often suggest that there is an epidemic of absentee black fathers.  However, when we look at this data, we see that black men who live with their children are highly engaged in their lives, at rates higher than other groups. And we see that even black men who live live separately from their kids are engaged in their lives at similar rates to other groups.  These facts alone completely debunks the myth of absentee black fathers.   One thing that is in the data is that black men are much more likely to live separately from their children... but this isn\'t an ""absentee father.""  No one would say that all divorced fathers are absentee.  If you want to dive into this fact and what it means we can but merely living separately from your kids doesn\'t make you an absentee father.', ""It measures men who live with their children and men who live separately from their children....     Men who are incarcerated are EXCLUDED.   And we find that black men who live with their children are slightly more involved than white men and black men who don't live with their children are slightly less involved... but it's all within a similar range.   In other words, when you remove incarcerated fathers... black men participate in their children's lives at similar rates to white fathers.  Which is what I originally said and what this data shows.   There are only 3 categories:  Fathers who live with their children. Fathers who live separately from their children. Fathers who are incarcerated    This data looks at the first two"", ' Correct. Fathers who live apart from their children are MORE absent then fathers who live with their children.  That seems an obvious fact.  But that isn\'t the claim. The claim is that there is an epidemic of absentee fathers among black families.  That black men are having children and abandoning them.  The data shows that this isn\'t true. There is little difference in how black men engage with their children.  What IS different is the percentages with which black men live with their children. Which is VERY different than not raising them.  What you COULD say is that despite black men engaging with their children at similar rates, since black men are more likely to live separately, ON AVERAGE they are less engaged with their children.  THAT you could say. Although I think that gets less FOX News clicks than ""Black men don\'t raise their kids.""   There is data to show that children do BEST in 2 family households (and even some more controversial and less compelling data that they do best in mother/fathers households) that trend doesn\'t hold for black children. Black children do much better in single family households than non-black children.  The theory here is that after 500 years of racism and violence leveled at black men (many killed, kidnapped, or imprisoned) that black families have developed support structures to raise children without fathers.    The KKK hung as many as 100,000 black men during the 20th century. I assume many of them had children.  So did George Floyd.   So the most you can say is there is fewer black men live with their children and that is reducing their engagement.      The next question would be why... My guess is racism is involved. We can talk about that if you want.']"

The difference between gross negligence and mere negligence is far more substantial than you might think. Your suggestion doesn't remotely meet the standard of gross negligence. Negligence is donating some food I might have known is bad. Gross negligence is donating food that I can see is crawling with maggots."", ' That ""just"" is doing an insane amount of heavy lifting. You can\'t just claim gross negligence, it will usually either be abundantly clear it\'s a case of gross negligence or you\'ll have very little chance of not having your case thrown out. Let\'s look at a couple definitions definitions.   [One from Cornell Law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/gross_negligence#): ""Gross negligence is a lack of care that demonstrates reckless disregard for the safety or lives of others, which is so great it appears to be a conscious violation of other people\'s rights to safety. Gross negligence is a heightened degree of negligence representing an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of care. Falling between intent to do wrongful harm and ordinary negligence, gross negligence is defined as willful, wanton, and reckless conduct affecting the life or property or another.   Gross negligence is considered more harmful than ordinary negligence because it implies a thoughtless disregard of the consequences and the failure to use even slight care to avoid harming the life or property of another.""  And one from a [Law office](https://www.freemaninjurylaw.com/blog/difference-between-negligence-gross-negligence/): ""Gross negligence is the extreme indifference to or reckless disregard for the safety of others. Gross negligence is more than simple carelessness or failure to act—it is willful behavior done with extreme disregard for the health and safety of others.  Examples of gross negligence include:  1. A driver speeding in an area with heavy pedestrian traffic; 2. A doctor prescribing a patient a drug that their medical records clearly list that they are allergic to; or 3. Nursing home staff failing to provide water or food to a resident for several days.""  As you can see these aren\'t exactly easy things to just claim.']"

Look at my previous comments if you don’t believe me.   Yep, I was comparing to the holocaust. If you think something like the holocaust happened in america for people violating gun laws, you are deluded.   There’s a lot of things I need to survive on a daily basis. So what you’re saying is objectively false.    Yep, I did. I said that wanting to kill people for fun with guns is sadistic and immoral. Not the same with alcohol. Seems like you lack the ability to pay attention.   Guns are killing machines, alcohol isn’t.   Guns are only used to hurt people. If you want to do target practice, you can use paintball guns. There’s no other need for actual guns.   It’s illegal to own a bomb because of the danger they pose to society. There.   Didn’t talk about the earth, I was talking about me. You lack reading comprehension skills it seems.   Nope, my standard was prohibiting things that are BOTH designed to be lethal/cause mass murders and not needed.   I’m not changing any standards. Protecting humans as sentient beings has been the standard in any ethical/legislative discussions. I just had to bring it up because it was clear that you lacked the critical thinking skills to realize the guns can’t be compared to humans or body parts.   Were you born with a gun attached to your body? That’s right, you weren’t.    Making guns illegal will drastically lower people’s ability to obtain and own guns. Will some people break the law? Sure. But then they’ll be punished. And again, eyeballs aren’t dangerous and they are a part of people’s bodies which they own. Guns aren’t    Not necessarily. Guns laws can be enforced by closing down stores that sell guns, imprisoning/fining people who guns, etc. No shooting involved in those scenarios. SWAT raids are only one option that are used when necessary    Again, I have mentioned it many times, but it’s not my fault if you don’t have reading comprehension skills. It’s not my responsibility to be punished for someone’s else’s actions.   I’ve said multiple times that alcohol isn’t killing anyone unless it’s abused. Guns are inherently killing machines. They are *only* used to hurt.   Again, I’ve said multiple times that alcohol in moderation has minimal health risks. Most people who drink alcohol will be fine. Anyone who uses a gun on people will hurt those people.    Then why do you need them? I already said you could go to a shooting range or use paintball guns for target practice. No need to own them.   Alcohol is not a killing machine and it’s not used to hurt others so it’s fine to trust people with it at home. Same doesn’t apply to guns   Guns are the machines through which people inflict mass murders. It seems like you lack basic common sense as well.   People   We also have laws to forbid people from driving drunk. Some people unfortunately break those laws, the same way that some people break any laws   Think again. I’ve never said anything of those things. I said countless times that laws could be unethical and if so, they should be changed. But gun laws aren’t. You haven’t given me one good reason why guns laws would be unethical that I wasn’t able to refute. I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve said that.    I just gave you two examples in this message. Owning explosives and driving drunk. Both are illegal because both are unsafe. Also, I don’t magically make up new standards. I bring up relevant ones that you ignore that cannot be applied to guns. Like for example, guns are not sentient beings like humans. So you can’t apply guns laws to humans.', ' Ok sure. You said that me saying “unethical laws should be reformed” was me creating a new standard. Look at abolition of slavery, women’s rights, civil rights, gay marriage rights. These are examples of situations where laws were reformed because they were unethical. See? I didn’t pull any standard out of thin air. It was an existing standard.    Guns are not the same as humans. Unless you’re trying to argue with me that guns have nerves and blood vessels and sentience, you can’t apply gun laws to people. Guns are killing machines. Alcohol isn’t. If it was, then why don’t we use alcohol in wars instead of guns? So yeah, these are objective differences between guns and the objects you compared them to. Still waiting for you to prove me wrong.   Already addressed this but guess you didn’t pay attention. Guns are dangerous killing machines, alcohol isn’t. So it’s safe to have alcohol in homes, not guns. Objective difference between guns and alcohol. If alcohol was as dangerous as guns, why aren’t they used in wars instead of guns?    Then go to the shooting range. No need to have guns in your home.    Wanna play a game where I give you a massacre caused by guns for every massacre caused by alcohol that you give me? I would win so easily because anyone with a basic amount of common sense knows that guns are lethal killing machines and alcohol isn’t. Talk to the families of tall the victims of school shootings if you want to use that logic on me.', ' I clarified what I meant there a long time ago because I clearly misspoke. I had said that in response to you saying that people violating gun laws are thrown into jail to reduce suicides. I responded by saying that they are thrown into jail because they violated a law. Go back to that comment if you don’t believe me. My mistake was using the word “should” instead of the word “are”. But I clarified my meaning. I also clarified that punishment for violating laws occurs because that’s how laws fundamentally work. If they didn’t, no one would follow any laws. After that, I also made it clear that if a law itself is unethical, it should be reformed because enforcing it would be unethical. Just because something is legal doesn’t mean it’s ethical. I didn’t make up any new standards. This is quite literally common sense and anyone with common sense would agree with me.    No, I brought up fundamental differences between guns and alcohol that makes your analogy invalid. In case you don’t know how analogies work, the comparison has to be valid 1) Alcohol is something that people consume for fun, and if used in moderation, it has minimal health risks. It isn’t normally used to hurt people and it doesn’t cause mass murder. The examples you brought up about the driving accidents are examples where alcohol is illegal: you can’t drive while drunk. 2) Guns are dangerous killing machines that have the ability to cause mass murders. I can give you a long list of examples of schools shootings and people using guns to mass murder people. They have no use unless you want to hurt people. If you want to do target practice, you can use paintball guns, other fake guns, or just go to a shooting range where you can use a gun for target practice. If you want to protect yourself, you can use knives, hammers, or any other household object.     I didn’t create any standards. Multiple standards already exist and I brought those into the discussion to refute the absurd claims you were making. For example, you said people should be killed because they aren’t needed like guns. And I said that people are sentient beings, not guns. This is an objective fact, not just some random standard I made up. Another example: where I said that if a law is unethical, it should be changed. Again, I didn’t make up a new standard. Ask anyone and they will agree with me. I again just brought it into the conversation to refute your claims. I didn’t just make it up.   It’s funny you are the one saying that, the person that compared getting rid of guns to getting rid of people (who are sentient living beings, not objects like guns) and the same person who compared enforcing gun laws to the holocaust (which is one of the biggest atrocities committed in history). I never once said that no person has been protected by a gun. I said that there are literal studies that prove that guns harm more than they protect. Saying ownership of explosives is illegal is not psychotic, it’s the law and for good reason. They are extremely dangerous. I also gave you many options that fulfill the same purpose as guns, so there’s no need to have guns.    Nope. Drunk driving is one scenario where alcohol is harmful and that’s why we have laws against it. Alcohol otherwise used in moderation has minimal health risks. Guns are inherently dangerous and lethal. I’ve given you alternatives for all the uses of guns, so there’s no need to own something so dangerous. What’s the alternative to drinking alcohol that would produce the same effect that causes people to enjoy alcohol?']

Standing out is one thing but singing in general is hard. I’ve tried singing multiple times and I suck at it. In my music class, my classmates and I had to sing notes sometimes (we play instruments), and we were all really bad at it. Also to understand music at a deeper level, you have to take music theory classes. There’s no OF theory class or degree cause there’s nothing to learn there. To become better at music, you have to constantly practice. To be able to perform that music, you have to have a lot of confidence. Practice itself isn’t enough. I practiced music a lot but every time I had to perform, I would fuck up because of my anxiety. To stand out in music, you have to be creative enough to make unique and good compositions.

Also, people have posted leaked photos of OF before and they’re mostly just bikini or ass pics. That takes a lot of hard I’m sure.

But he is not responsible for the IT revolution.  Here\'s how MS got where it was:  1. Moderately succesful business selling traffic management software. 2. Better business selling a popular form of BASIC for various systems. 3. Gates catches wind that IBM is having trouble licensing CP/M from Digital Research. He also knows a guy who wrote a hobbiest clone of CP/M. 4. Gates offers to sell IBM ""his"" operating system. 5. Gates buys all rights to the CP/M clone for 50 grand. 6. Gates licenses MS-DOS to IBM, but sells it at a cheap price. Once the PC clones come around, MS-DOS becomes the de facto standard.  Of course MS continued to capitalize on successes and introduced many competitive products over the years. However, they were rarely the first mover on any technology; they were just entrenched enough that they had a lot of opportunities to leverage network effects, and fast enough to capitalize on them.  If IBM had licensed CP/M instead of MS-DOS, the PC market might look different, but the overall IT revolution would have carried on regardless...and Gary Kildall would hopefully be a lot more ""not killed in a bar fight"".', 'That comparison is not fair for a few reasons. For one, Microsoft is involved in a huge number different industries, whereas...I don\'t even know what the number for Linux means. Presumably it\'s of all sales of paid Linux-based products? Many of which are sold *by Microsoft* on their Azure platform? And that won\'t include all of the non-paid Linux installs which won\'t show up in any market share numbers.  So basically there is nothing comparable in those numbers. They represent different things.  As far as desktop, Windows is still dominant in desktop yes, but Apple is no slouch and is actually a larger company (in fact, *the largest company in the world*).  But none of this is the point, because what I\'m arguing against is the claim that Bill Gates was responsible for the IT revolution. He was in no way responsible for it; it was already happening when MS-DOS came on the scene, and it would have carried on perfectly well without him.  In the ""DR-DOS"" universe, you are still using a web browser to talk to people halfway around the world on a chat website, and I can still do my job from my bedroom. Here are some much stronger candidates to consider:  * Douglas Englebart - Mother of all Demos * Ken Thompson/Dennis Ritchie - UNIX * Jim Clark - Silicon Graphics * Gordon Moore/Robert Noyce - Intel * Bill Joy - Sun Microsystems * Tim Berners-Lee - the World Wide Web * Rod Canion/Jim Harris/Bill Murto - Compaq, the first IBM PC clone company * Grace Hopper - High-level programming languages * Margaret Hamilton - Software engineering as a discipline  And countless other people I\'m forgetting who standardized things like networking protocols, busses, and other interfaces or applications that made the world go round smoothly and efficiently. If anything, the primary job of Microsoft was to make things more proprietary and less open, which is often a hinderance.  If I were compiling a list of people who were ""responsible for the IT revolution"", Bill Gates would be somewhere near the bottom of a different list.  But I still really like Bill Gates.', ""Hmmm, not reeeeally.  On the server side, which is where all the real money in IT is made, Linux absolutely dominates (usually on somebody else's computer \\*cough\\* sorry, I mean the cloud). Windows exists, but it ever-dwindles. Even in the olden days, Netware and UNIX variants competed handily with windows for server-side stuff; certainly unix variants were being used for this purpose before MS-DOS even existed.  On the desktop side, you are right that Windows is dominant (modern Windows isn't actually related to MS-DOS in any way, that lineage ended with Windows ME). However, if IBM had licensed CP/M, that OS would probably have filled the same role. Or OS/9 from the Macintosh, or AmigaOS, or some UNIX variant (unlikely)... or maybe there would have been no dominant business OS.  It's so difficult to speculate about what that world would have looked like exactly...Microsoft was so dominant that they had an effect on how everything developed. However, I don't believe that the Digital Research driven universe would have been fundamentally different in character from the Microsoft driven one. There just would have been different logos on the boxes.""]"

Instincts of self preservation, self development, desire for improved quality of life, happiness, pain, hunger etc stem from hard coded biological conditions that prelude self awareness. These may be understood as logical scientific processes by AI to a degree infinitely greater than our own understanding, but they cannot be experienced by nor influence the developmental trajectory of these purely logical constructs.  One could even argue that complete self awareness might itself safeguard against the accidental formation of true self determination. A system capable of developing the conditions for independent desire, which also has enough self awareness to realise and act on said desires must also be capable of removing the conditions.  Why would a logical system continue to want if it could understand the entire mechanism of its own desire, and freely remove the mechanism without effort?

It isn't hypocritical because the animal's consent or harm to the animal was never a concern so apparent inconsistency on that point is irrelevant. The wrongness of bestiality is not the harm to the animal, but the insult to the dignity of humanity to go to such lows.

The reason slaughtering animals for consumption isn't animal abuse is because the object of the conduct is not the killing but the meat which provides a justifiable utility to a person. Self defense, i.e. preserving one's life, is a justifiable utility and what occured in your example. Sadism is not what occured on your example because, even though mistaken in fact, the purpose was justified.

There\'s a difference between why and how.  Sexual reproduction is HOW we exist.  Sexual reproduction does not explain WHY we exist at all (aka what our purpose is).   Why we exist is a philosophical and/or religious question.  Science cannot tell us what our purpose is.   produce.  Yes but using that as a reason alone to claim the fetus isn\'t a parasite seems very arbitrary. It\'s a moral claim. He already admitted that pregnancy and the fetus does fit the general definitions of parasitism used by many biologists.  The only reason he disagrees is because he believes that the purpose of women is to be pregnant.  The only reason he doesn\'t believe it to be a parasite is because of his personal views on women.   Ah! So you\'re admitting that it\'s parasitic!   But this still does not assign purpose to any person.  The professor said that the only reason he doesn\'t consider the ZEF a parasite is because he views women being pregnant as fulfilling their genetic purpose.  This framework leaves out so many different individuals!  It leaves out infertile women. Are infertile women ""genetic failures"" simply because they cannot get pregnant?  What about lesbian women? Are they genetic failures? Gay men?  What about menopausal women? Are they no longer worthy of consideration because they cannot reproduce anymore?  Tokophobic women? Are they genetic failures wirh no purpose?  Someone in his comment section said the same thing:  *""Did you really mean to say that women exist to get pregnant, and it is “the ultimate biological purpose of (her) life?” I am sincerely asking for a clarification because it is an assertion with serious implications.""*  *""I am a gay man. Have I abdicated the biological purpose of my life? Then, we have infertile people, who would have no purpose at all. By this, I mean you seem to have overstepped by giving the science of reproduction a universal, philosophical value.""*  *""Do human lives need a biological purpose?""*  *""If “biological purpose” exists, then it can mean only reproduction. If that were true, we’d be on a quick and slippery slope toward to an over-crowded planet, and our own extinction.""*  *""In that light, we are better off a species if a significant minority of people fail to achieve this purpose, and a significant number of women fail to reproduce. But that brings the debate full circle because it means that all women do not inherently share a biological mandate.""*  Basically, this user is pointing out how over-reproduction is actually a bad thing and how it\'s evolutionary advantageous for there to be people who don\'t reproduce.  The professor didn\'t disagree with him.  Too add, Women are at peak fertility for about a 1/3 of their lifetime. I do not buy that our purpose for existing hinges on something we can do only 30 percent of our life.   Ah! You said ""those who have this feeling"" which means that you\'re recognizing that there are those who don\'t.    Absolutely false. I already explained to you that parasites do often benefit the host. Not re-explaining, I\'ll just link the comment once again:https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/zoi61d/what_is_so_bad_about_convenience_abortions/j0vsk1s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3  An example of a parasite that benefits the body is hookworms. Hookworms provide the body many benefits but they\'re still classified as parasites due to the harm they impose as well.   It makes sense to the plenty of biologists in the sources I sent you.   Even the professor you sent me said that he can see why biologists refer to it as parasitic, he just doesn\'t agree based on his own misconceptions about the purpose of women.   No, even in the comment section, he admits that part of his answer is due to philosophical reasoning.  *""There’s nothing wrong with being reductive. Reductionism is a vital tool for scientific and **philosophical understanding.**""*  So, he has already admitted that his answer is partly philosophical, it\'s not purely scientific.  What he is using is called Genetic Reductionism which is a type of Biological Determinism and it\'s highly problematic!  [Genetic reductionism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_reductionism): Genetic reductionism is the belief that understanding genes is sufficient to understand all aspects of human behavior.[1] It is a specific form of reductionism and of biological determinism, based on a perspective which defines genes as distinct units of information with consistent properties.[2] It also covers attempts to define specific phenomena in exclusively genetic terms, as in the case of the ""warrior gene"".[3]  The concept has been criticized by many biologists.[4] According to Affifi (2017), ""With the discoveries of pleiotropy and epistasis, cracks in the reductionist paradigm emerged even before the rise of molecular biology, but the full extent of the interdependency and flexible adaptivity of the genome has really come to light in the past 10 years...""[5] The genetic reductionist perspective can be appropriate when used to identify changes in specific genetic loci that cause differences in a given phenotype.[6]  [Biological determinism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_determinism): Biological determinism, also known as genetic determinism,[1] is the belief that human behaviour is directly controlled by an individual\'s genes or some component of their physiology, generally at the expense of the role of the environment, whether in embryonic development or in learning.[2] Genetic reductionism is a similar concept, but it is distinct from genetic determinism in that the former refers to the level of understanding, while the latter refers to the supposedly causal role of genes.[3]   Biological determinism has been associated with movements in science and society including **eugenics, scientific racism, and the debates around the heritability of IQ,[4] the basis of sexual orientation,[5] and sociobiology.[6]**  The professor you sent is using a philosophy that justifies eugenics, racism, and rape.   He admitted in his answer that he doesn\'t believe that animals can rape each- other (despite zoologista saying otherwise). He believes that those are just different mating strategies in order to further our ""genetic purpose""', ' Parasites can be the same species. It\'s called intraspecfic parasitism.   What does this even mean?   Absolutely false.  [The placenta is simply a neuroendocrine parasite.

Most parasites do it in order to make their environment more habitual. It\'s not done to ""help the mother"". It\'s done when the pregnant person is healthy enough to expend extra resources. If the pregnant person is not healthy enough to expend extra resources, the ZEF will deplete the body as much as possible.

There\'s nothing wrong with using outdated research in tandem with recent research, but if your only source is something this incredibly outdated, then that is not a good look.  Two, I find it highly suspicious that I cannot find this source anywhere else on the internet except in this blog post.  When I put their ""source"" into my search engine, it only brings me back to the same blog post.  Basically, this post credited itself as a source for their information.  I cannot find any evidence that this ""Professor Thomas L. Johnson"" even exists.  He is only ever mentioned online in this blog post.  Even searching, ""Thomas L. Johnson, pro-life"" brings up nothing but this blog post. Even when I changed it to, ""Thomas L. Johnson, 1974"" it still brings me back to this one blog post. Nothing else.   This a blog post made by a Christian website.   Nope, as you can see, they outright call them parasites.   Can you prove that they\'re not credible?   So you lied when you said you haven\'t seen a single pregnant person use language similar to parasite.']"

Read the dental literature, there isn't a treatment out there whether chemical or using certain frequencies of light that can fully sterilise the root canal system. This means bacteria remain indefinitely. I could go on about the basic structure of a tooth. Most are far more complex with lateral and accessory canals than you would imagine, making mechanical removal and filling of these areas basically impossible. But even if these didn't exist we know anaerobic bacteria grow inside the tubules, and each tooth has millions of these. Anaerobic bacteria are on the order of 1000 times more toxic than aerobic. It's really their metabolic waste which cause most of the issues. Think botulism. Dead teeth really turn into toxic waste factories in your mouth."", 'What?  The tooth has what is referred to as pulp.  The pulp is in the central part of the tooth and contains nerves yes, but it also contains blood vessels.  When a tooth ""dies"" that blood supply is cut off making the tooth just a structure of Dentin and Enamel.  That\'s what a dead tooth is.    In your example it would be more like a limb ~~loosing~~ losing both its nerve connection to the brain as well as its blood supply.  Effectively making it a dead limb that would need to be cut off.  I\'m not saying a dead tooth needs to be removed, especially after receiving a root canal, but a dead tooth is actually dead.', ' Should we compare it to the bones inside their limbs if those bones loose their blood supply?  I was only using the paraplegic example because the person I was replying to was making it seem like nerves were the only thing you\'re losing when a tooth ""dies"".    The blood supply and nerves to the tooth is cut off and that\'s why they call it a dead tooth.  Arguing otherwise is fairly pointless, as it is a well established term throughout the dental community to refer to a tooth that has lost its nerves and blood supply.      I do not know where I made such a belief known, and in fact stated I don\'t think a dead tooth should be removed. Specifically for the reasons you listed making it still very functional.  I realize the top comment in this chain of comments was stating their opinion about implants and root canals, but I was not addressing the top comment.

Your GitHub link idea is definitely a good one, and would be a better metric than going through resumes. The issue with that becomes that people who graduated bootcamps wouldn’t have anywhere near the level of skill required to set something like that up. So your idea, while certainly a good one, only really works for a specific and uncommon subset of individuals: those who are skilled developers, but don’t have a good amount of industry experience or a college degree.   Unrelated to the CMV: If you have the skill but you’re having trouble with getting past the automated screening, you should still put your 2-year degree in the “education” section and then fill your “relevant experience” with 10 years worth of projects or whatever you’ve worked on. If you’ve created any web apps or standalone applications, put them in this format:  • \u2060May 2018-July 2018: Built an e-commerce website that had the capacity to facilitate 300,000 transactions per day • \u2060October 2018-March 2020: Built a file sharing website that gave users the ability to upload and download a variety of different files  Also, if you’re looking for jobs right now, keep in mind that the market sucks currently. A lot of industries have hiring freezes, and the ones that don’t are lowballing potential candidates because they know that the number of candidates is much larger than the number of jobs available.   To stay up-to-date on hiring practices, I apply to a couple places every few months and interview with them to see what kinds of questions get asked. Recently, I did well in a technical round for a Senior Software Engineer position at a company out of state; I got an offer letter, and they offered me $96K, *knowing* that I currently make $130K in a relatively LCOL area. I’m not saying that to brag; I’m saying that because it’s ridiculous, but companies know that engineers are desperate to find better places to work, especially remote positions, and they’re capitalizing on that right now', 'Having a 4-year degree is valuable because it shows you stuck with something for four years and have enough skill to pass your capstone. I hear you regarding filtering if you’re talking about recruiter filtering, but if you knew how many resumes came through every day and how rare it is to find someone that skilled without a college degree or some level of experience (independent contractor, etc.), you’d understand as well.   The whole point of a technical interview is to allow those who have significant technical skill to be able to get a job. If I get a resume that contains links to multiple amazing web apps someone has built but they didn’t get a degree, I don’t care. That’s why CS is amazing: CS jobs have the lowest bar to entry of any of the high paying careers. Being a doctor or lawyer means you have to go to school for much longer, are required to pass challenging examinations, and are required to perform continuing education in order to get a high paying job. In any other field, going from a $60K/year job to a $230K/year job is unheard of, and yet in CS, it’s easily doable provided you have the skill.   How would you restructure the hiring process? Bear in mind: Interviews are expensive from the perspective of a company. Each candidate’s interview process normally costs the company at least $500 just in salaries alone. Why would a company want to take a chance on someone who shows no tangible experience when they have the opportunity to hire others who do have tangible experience, even if all of that experience was while they were an undergraduate?', 'Good question! So the hardest part, if you have technical skill but no 4-year degree, is to get past the resume screen. This is typically done by a recruiter or HR, and they typically see a resume without a college degree and want to toss it because they’re boomers who don’t know that people can have technical skill without college.   You can try to get past it by putting relevant experience. If you’ve created any web apps or standalone applications, put them in the “relevant experience” section of your resume. Something like  * May 2018-July 2018: Built an e-commerce website that had the capacity to facilitate 300,000 transactions per day * October 2018-March 2020: Built a file sharing website that gave users the ability to upload and download a variety of different files  Once you get into the interview phase, they’ll ask about these. First, talk about your architecture. If you used a VM on your machine and connected to it, say something like “I used VMware Fusion and ran a RHEL 8 server which hosted the application. Networking-wise, I bridged the server with my laptop’s network card, and hosted the application on my local network at first. Once I verified that that was functional, I opened the port on my router and forwarded it to my laptop, which forwarded traffic on that port to my VM, which server up the website to any clients that connected to my public IP.   Then, talk about your app: “I used Python and FastAPI and hosted it with Hypercor ” or “I used PHP and hosted it with Nginx”. Talk about any routes you used, and what your app does specifically. “I have a health route that can be tied to a load balancer to make sure the app is healthy. I also have a downloadFile route that takes a file name as a parameter and returns the file as a byte stream. This way, the full file is not loaded in memory at once. The byte stream is sent to the client, which is then downloaded as a file to the client’s filesystem.”  Finally, make sure to talk in detail about any challenges you faced and how you overcame them. As an interviewer, I want to hear those above all else. Also, talk about mistakes you made and how you fixed them. I’ve worked in the industry long enough to know that anyone who says they haven’t made any mistakes either hasn’t worked in industry long enough to make any, or is too proud to admit them.   Overall, good luck! If you’re going the self-taught route, it’s hard because it requires a lot of discipline, but if it’s something you’re passionate about, just take it one concept at a time, and it’ll add up before you know it!']

The ELI5  (and now that I think about this, this was closer to 20 or even 25 years back now.... )    So portland has a huge, very well loved, bookstore called Powels.  They had a mural painted on the side of their building by some local hippy artists. The mural had a very small portion that said ""free tibet""  One day a chinese man in a stereotypical black suit comes up to the manager and asks, for reasons,  that powels removes the ""free tibet""  The manager, being a indie bookstore manager and a resident of portland, tells the guy to go eat a dick.  The man politely leaves.  A few days later the man shows back up again with the mayor and a number of city council members, in an official motorcade who makes some remarks about trying to be harmonious trade partners with china(this was when wash and oregon were signing major local trade deals for fruit and agro with china)  and powels painted the mural without a permit and made powles paint over the mural or face a bunch of major fines.   Powels complied.   There was a bit of local protest but it quickly died off...  (since then I think they may have taken up the banner and repainted the ""free tibet"" back after like 10-15 years.  I think I read that once...)    Anyway, the shadow influence to the CCP in action.

The tissue was taken and Henrietta lacks was not compensated. The tissue at that time had very little utility. It was made useful by a series of academic researchers who made a cell line called HeLa that they freely distributed. They didn’t make any money off this. You can still get the cell line for free. People than used this freely available cell line that did not come with any licensing obligations to perform research to develop entirely different products that were profitable.  So ethically it seems that researchers turned medical waste into something useful that has been used for a variety of experiments both academic and commercial. I don’t see why the family member of the person from whom the cancer tissue was taken should be compensated. Compensation is usually for some work somebody did or to compensate somebody for harm. I don’t see Henrietta lacks or her family doing any work. I don’t see any harm. I don’t see any reason they should be compensated.', 'I agree that if somebody was wronged, their surviving family members should be able to seek compensation. My point is that I cannot seem to find any significant injustice that Henrietta Lacks suffered.  To clarify what happened, she had a malignant cancer removed from her cervix. That surgery was going to be performed regardless since it was cancer. That tissue that was going to be thrown out was used in an experiment and some of those cells were able to be grown. Those cells were used in many subsequent experiments .  There are two issues I can think of here. First is that no consent was obtained. However consent in the 1950s was essentially not common practice. I think it might make sense to try and compensate every patient who’s tissue was used without consent back then, however I don’t think it makes sense to compensate just one person and ignore the rest of the people who are also Affected by this practice.  The second issue is that her sample went on to create a valuable soul and that other people have profited from. Some people think that she or her family should be able to profit from those products. The issue I have with this is that generally speaking, patients are not compensated for their biopsy tissue and certainly not given a percentage of the profits of anything developed from it. Is this fair? It is the system that medical organizations all over the world have all decided is the norm so it seems to be standard ethical practice. I also think that makes sense since discoveries made in your treatment should go on to benefit other patients and you shouldn’t be able to withhold knowledge in exchange for payment.', 'I believe in the concept of reparations generally speaking. However these biopsy samples were taken from numerous people, black white rich and poor. None of these people were ever compensated for the biopsy samples. This was tissue that would’ve been thrown away otherwise but was used to advance medicine and help other people. Based on this, Henrietta Lacks was treated no differently and the tissue taken from her body was taken to help her and would’ve been thrown away but for the efforts of the researchers who did all the work.  In the scenario, Henrietta’s body wasn’t taken, rather a cancer was removed in an effort to save her life. Tissue that had no value was made valuable through the work of other people. I don’t see how she really added any value. I certainly don’t think there is any merit to any claim of discrimination since samples from white people and rich people were treated the same way.  Personally I think her family is playing the race card to try and get money from companies and organizations. If you can show me any evidence of discrimination, please go ahead. However I can’t find anything to say that a person of a different race would’ve been treated differently.']

Also, Smith is absolutely spot on.  I recently read a book about the rise of the landed nobility in early medieval france and it was pretty unequivocal about where it came from.  Basically this or that random person with access to more resources than their neighbors built castles.  These people came to be called Castellans.  Since no one really had the ability to do anything about these castles, Castellans slowly became able to essentially write the social order to their whims via forcing people to be tenants on 'their' land and so on and so forth.  Obviously many of these people wanted their lands and wealth passed onto their children and over a few generations, the landed nobility was born.  Point being they didn't spring fully formed from the ground as nobles.    They were, in many ways, capitalists.

Suffice it to say that solar cycles and their causes are still being studied.  No the paper does not claim to find a novel property of orbits. That is a disingenuous misconstruing of what the paper claims. Perhaps it characterizes the phenomenon incorrectly, but it isn\'t the main subject of the paper.  As discussed in your link, the topic of variation in Earth-Sun distance due to SIM is raised periodically in astronomy all the time. There\'s a feeling by some that this is an error that needs to be batted down, but the argument for why it\'s an error seems inadequate.  Cutting through the fog, this is how the discussion has appeared to me:  1. Simple models using Kepler\'s laws describe short-term orbital mechanics perfectly. These models don\'t demonstrate an effect of SIM on Earth-Sun distance (they wouldn\'t if they weren\'t built to do so, they are not simulating the curvature of spacetime, they are simulating a set of ellipses which influence each other in a fixed way). 2. There apparently has been some observed variation in Earth-Sun distance. This manifests not in absolute distance, but in the extremes of the ellipse (I assume also this unevenly intersects with axial tilt and so climate effects would exaggerate if summer/winter hits either extreme). 3. That observed variation is totally denied, people are called names, the model is invoked, institutional authority is asserted.  Even your own arguments come off as a set of talking points, fodder for a press campaign.   That\'s just not accurate and you seem to have followed this closely enough to know it. But it\'s red meat for a press release type of messaging which would obfuscate the issue.  Kharkova\'s critics admit her interpretation is one which occasionally emerges. They are trying to claim it\'s obviously wrong and that she\'s sloppy, but it is totally wrong for them to claim that she claimed to find some new property and her paper is seeking to defend it. That\'s what we call lying disingenuity and it doesn\'t speak favorably to the critics.  By the way, it takes almost 200 comments for them to get to the point of admitting that the idea is not new to Kharkova.  If you can show me a 500 year observational record that directly contradicts the predictions of one of the more than one papers predicting variations in Earth-Sun distance, I\'ll believe you. But invoke a relatively static, decades-long series, or use your model with its flat line, and I have no reason to believe you.  Do these models include the internal momentum of the Sun around the SSB? A ""wobble"" in the Sun induced by the influence of the planets over time? I don\'t think Kepler\'s ellipses model that. Think spinning wine around in a glass.  I\'ve only just been introduced to this topic, but something is missing behind a very disingenuous approach by Kharkova\'s critics.   Geoff Sharp, for instance, seems like he might be trying to backtrack and cover for his previous work so he doesn\'t become a target of the crazy alarmists. You see that a lot in professional circles. People who have to deny and correct things they said in the past because the air in the room has changed.', 'That was painful to read through.  Arrogant scientists engaging in mean apologetics is a bit disgusting to witness.  Zharkova\'s paper ties empirical observations to SIM cycles. She doesn\'t necessarily explain why this correlation exists.  As many people noted, irrespective of orbital mechanics, the reality of SIM means substantial changes in the tidal effects of plasma within the Sun. It could just as easily be this which causes SIM cycles to correlate to climatic changes on Earth.  However, it took one Brian Takita to finally make the point that our model of the solar system based on Kepler\'s observations would necessarily be accurate over a long time frame of 100s of years, but there still remains a possibility that over 1000s of years the current model would start to become inaccurate because of this concept of the planets all orbiting a system barycenter.  The point of disagreement, at least in terms of observations, is noting that it takes 100s to 1000s of years for SIM cycles to progress. It\'s not a phenomenon that would show up in a short term model of the solar system\'s orbital mechanics.  In other words, within a few centuries time frame, you can model the solar system by assuming planets exclusively orbit their own unique barycenter with the Sun. And of course, the admission that the Sun itself orbits a SSB. However, the catch is that over 1000s of years the entire system is orbiting the SSB.  That is, Earth IS in fact orbiting the SSB, not the Sun-Earth barycenter, however, the difference between the two is only measurable over thousands of years. That\'s not stated completely accurately. Something more like the Sun-Earth barycenter processes around the SSB over 1000s of years. Something like that.  It does seem like it remains an unanswered question. That scienceTM has realized that this question relates to the sacred grail of climate science, and so it\'s untouchable and won\'t be investigated. Like so much of climate alarmism poisoned science, the question doesn\'t need to be investigated so it can be ignored for now. Orbital models would only be affected by SIM in the long run, so they wouldn\'t need to incorporate the concept for centuries.  Nevertheless, Zharkova\'s paper still identifies some correlation between SIM cycles and climate.  Plenty of statistical nitpicking which even that peer group was unhappy about. Criticisms of Zharkova\'s English ability. Being nasty and rude but then claiming it\'s just being direct, but then critiquing her for being agitated.  What a mess.  Thanks though. As always, every time I dig into a controversial point related to climate I learn almost every time that the alarmist position is wrong, and gain insight into how institutional science is capable of consistently supporting bad science. Science can be hard, which is just a way of saying that lies, arrogance, dissimulation and so forth can make inquiry and debate resolution quite difficult.  It has been argued that Science has to be extremely adversarial in order to properly function, institutionally. Big, nasty, drawn out fights between committed intelligent people. Because sometimes issues are just quite complex and the ""point"" is missed. Look at biological and social sciences, where ethics panels pre-screen papers to avoid any controversy or hurt feelings. What a modern world.  u/randomhomonid what do you think?', 'I\'ve looked into it further and part of your ""orbits are known"" includes the fact that SIM affects the eccentricity of Earth\'s orbit, which has been known for a long time. The claim is that this change in eccentricity is minor, moreover it doesn\'t change the average distance from the Sun.  Zharkova addressed this in a whole paper. The seasonal/axial position of the Earth relative to perihelion is where the change solar irradiance comes from.  So, Zharkova is neither inventing new concepts about orbits, nor is she claiming something that is outside of what ""has been known forever"".  You MAY still argue that even with all this in mind, the effect is too minor to be worth consideration, but that\'s different than what is claimed.  This very strongly resembles institutional wagon-circling, and disingenuous, fallacious gatekeeping.  Zharkova is partly at fault for her poor English ability, but her critics were coming with an agenda.  Her ""basic logic check"" was valid. The SSB is not merely the average of all planet-Sun barycenters. If it was, the Sun\'s center of mass would orbit the SSB in a perfect circle. The Sun is carried on an inertial ride around the SSB, it\'s ""tossed about"", leading to non-circular orbit patterns. That necessarily implies that the planets are not totally and rigidly locked to their barycenter with the Sun.  Again, we do see variations in the Earth\'s eccentricity orbiting the Sun.  This whole thing was greatly complicated by evil and disingenuous, nasty or cowardly gatekeeping scientists.']"

Lockpicking requires Security (or Lockpicking) and lockpicks, while the magical version requires Alteration, multiple spells, and enough magicka to cast (also preferably the silent casting perk from Illusion).', ""The granularity is only meaningless if you consider Lockpicking in a vacuum. Within the context of the game's systems Lockpicking is an investment that needs to be made against other skills. The granularity allows you to invest in multiple skills at the same time and offers control over the extent of that investment. It's a legitimate strategy for example, to raise Lockpicking from 45 to 51 and keep Mentats handy to get you to 55 when you need to pick a lock—allowing the other points to be invested elsewhere until the next level.    Fallout 4 removes the skill system entirely and then incorporates rote stat increases into the Perk tree. To accommodate the lack of granularity in stat investments Fallout 4 removes the level cap and significantly increasing the frequency at which the player levels up. This is a meaningful reduction in complexity. Lockpicking is now represented by three discrete Perk values (Advanced/Master/Expert) unlocked at specific level increments not a freely chosen investment. The final upgrade to Lockpicking makes your bobby pins invincible so managing bobby pins is eliminated as a balancing mechanic. Magazines and books are removed from the game. Mentats are in the game but have no meaningful utility without a skill system.   There were moments of emergent gameplay in New Vegas and Fallout 3 where I had neglected to invest in Lockpicking but triumphantly bypassed a crucial area because I had Locksmith Reader and a pack of Mentats in my inventory that just barely got me to 75 lockpicking. That's just gone with Fallout 4's system."", ""I mean both forms use different tactics to solve the same problem.  Physical lockpicking (whether in Fallout or TES use the same system) can use stat buffs, in the form of Chems, Magazines, Scrolls, and Blessings, as well as Higher Quality Lockpicks in order to allow them access to the Lockpicking minigame.  Magical lockpicking (in TES only) uses similar stat buffs to achieve the same goal, but in a different way. Whereas physical increases stats to access the minigame, magical increases a different set of stats to actually cast the spell, either to give yourself the magicka or to appease the spell chance algorithm. The exception of course lockbreaking scrolls which can break the lock for you but at a cost.  But still, the biggest tradeoff between the two is strategic in nature rather than tactical.   Physical lockpicking requires the skill and the tool. The tool is trivial. I don't know about you but I've never bought a lockpick or bobby pin in any game except Morrowind, since lockpick quality was a thing there. The skill requires you to either place stat points (NV) or perk points (Skyrim/FO4) which you could otherwise put into combat or other skills.  Magical lockpicking requires the skill and the spell. You probably put points into the skill already because Alteration contains an important spell for mages. The spell however has to be bought or found. You also will need multiple versions to handle higher and higher level locks and those higher level spells cost more magicka, meaning more investment into that as well, though you also probably do that anyway being a mage.""]"

The poor ones who are looking for a visa would be easier to get, and they\'re generally more submissive which I\'m guessing you\'d prefer. I know plenty of white guys with Asian fetish who couldn\'t get an Asian girl in the West so they decided to go to an Asian country (usually working as unqualified English teachers) to bring back an Asian girl looking for a visa so it can be done.']"

Buttigieg saying to himself in the mirror, ""hey, if you endorse Biden, maybe you\'ll get something""?   But what value did his endorsement have to be able to bargain with?  Like you said, he was not going to win anything beyond Iowa, so how could his endorsement be mathematically worth it for Biden to offer anything?

Fire companies are incentivized to put out fires regardless of if the person's house on fire is insured or not.    Private firms operated without boundary. They gave service around those that paid, not exclusively or monopolized to a certain boundary. A government fire department is quite literally a monopoly of a service over a boundary.    The privatized firm is incentivized to give the best service at the lowest cost. Doing anything other than that gives their market to their competition.

The only evidence we have right now  is that they DID put out all fires until a LAW was made that had unintended consequences.', ""Just research the firefighting industry in the 1800's...they had many issues because the first group to the fire would get the insurance payment, which resulted in fighting amongst the fireman as well as sabotage...oftentimes the buildings would burn to the ground while the firefighters fought over who got to put it out. Or in other circumstances if the building wasn't covered by anyone who was going to pay they would just let it burn, or if there was more money at a fire across town they would go there while the other building burned. Territory was established by the private firms and fights over that began, also if there was a dispute over territory maybe nobody would show up.We've been there done that, why go back? The new privatized fire department is paid to save money whereas the state version is tasked with saving lives ahead of everything else, for free. I'm not against them overall, I just think that monetizing life saving industries puts profit ahead of people which just shouldn't be the case with some things...firefighting being one. Unless the industry M.O. stated that saving lives and making sure fires were out regardless of who owned the policy or their ability to pay, then maybe I could see it working.

When in fact there was an existing welfare state that they dismantled.   “ Social services. Public welfare, largely under the jurisdiction of local and district authorities before 1933, was partly transferred by the Nazi government to affiliates of the Nazi party. Particularly to the Nationalsozailistiche Volkswohlfahrt (National Socialist People’s Welfare Organization–NSV). The most important activity was the Winterhilfe (Winter Help), the distribution of money and goods among the poorest population. NSV was funded with a fee charged on the earnings of employed workers, and with quasi-compulsory levies in cash or in kind from farmers, peasants, employers and the middle classes generally (Guillebaud, 1941, pp. 96). Financial control of the Winter Help was in the hands of the Treasurer of the Nazi Party (Pollock, 1938, p. 164), and the compulsory character of the contributions was so clear that they have been 21 Pollock (1938, p. 43-68) provides an extensive revision of the organizational characteristics of the Nazi Party holding of organizations. 22 Nathan (1944a, p. 321) also points out that Education no longer remained the exclusive function of the public school system, but was shifted in part to the Hitler Youth Organization. 23 Völtzer (135, pp. 4-6) offers a thorough revision of the German Labor Front legal configuration. 24 Besides, it also delivered new services such as the leisure program Strength through Joy (Kraft durch Freude). These are of less interest to our analytical purposes. 7   considered an additional source of fiscal revenues (Balogh 1938, 472). In 1933/34 the NSV realized 350 million marks, which in 1936/37 grew to 408.3 million marks (Pollock, 1938, p. 138; Guillebaud, 1941, pp. 97). Estimates in Nathan (1944b, p. 94) give figures of Rm. 340 in 1934/35 and 370 after 1937. Reichs-Kredit-Gesellschaft (1939, p. 101) gives an estimate of Rm. 400 million in 1938, according to official statistics. As explained in The Banker (1937, p. 171), the German government had provided Winter Help before the Nazi regime. A comparison between the expenditures of the Reich Winter Relief in 1931 and the Nazi Winter Relief in 1933 “shows that this new Nazi organisation has not provided in Winter Help more than the former contribution made by the Reich alone....Under the Nazi system .... a huge apparatus has been created to carry out a service formerly provided as a ‘side-line’ by private and public bodies.” (p. 171). In short, delivered by private and public bodies before the Nazi regime, Winter Help was completely privatized by the Nazi government and was transferred to a Party Organization. The funding of the service was based on a compulsory scheme of fees and levies. Because of this, the Reich Budget was relieved of the expenditure implied by this social service program.”', 'Here it is again since you must have missed it the first time.

This was only allowed after bad births, or if women were “hysteric” after a miscarriage but since the 70s the church is way more lenient in allowing “natural family planning” which still considering pulling out entirely sinful. You can count her period days to reduce your chances but you better finish inside says the church  Edit:  also in general never trust an american catholic, much less one that quotes tbe bible instead of the pope. Most catholic doctrine comes directly from one of the Cathecisms from the 2nd Vatican Council, anyone referencing anything much older than that is prob out of date with current dogma', ' its in the same cathecism if im not mistaken, it was also relevant on the conversations of Francis in south east asia.  Edit: found it   See the explicit reference to marriage groups, and pastors. It is not something families ought to decide by themselves as the attempt to deny the procreative aspect is sinful.    if your priest allows it.   The only text I found supporting explicitly sex post menopause mentions women who believe in the miracle of St Elizabeth, if they do not and had a pap exam and are infertile then the official position is that you are defing the main purpose of nuptial act. There is also a popal text from 1930, which endorses the rhythm method and post menopause sex but that has been clarified multiple times since and is no longer the official recommendation (although its still allowed).  So if you trully believe that you can harbour a miracle some catholics seem to believe it does not count. But due to it being considered a contraceptive (infertility by menopause) it would fall under the last exception of the paragraph you shared on your last message.  As it being effectively an act that renders the procreation impossible it would be sinful.   Also found this piece on a family council   https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_12021997_vademecum_en.html   it is pretty explicit in its position about unfruitful marital acts.    I found it interesting how english sources seemed more open to the idea that the ones in my native langauge so I did some digging. You can read further into why American theologians disagree with the Vatican in many of this points due to a non approved study that American catholics embraced in the 70s, is on the Dissent area.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_theology_of_sexuality  My main language is not english so I did find more sources with similar points as the ones you were making, so I investigated further into why the anglosphere seemed to go against all italian, spanish and latin texts. And the wikipedia article had a nice summary. But yeah I think the official position is clear, natural family planning can be done with approval from your pastor or priest. Else sex should have the aim of procreation to fulfill its covenant with god']

They operate under the same traffic laws, the traffic laws aren’t different, the safety laws aren’t different, and the emissions laws aren’t different. They use the exact same fuel from the exact same sources which pay the exact same taxes. They have to be registered every year, and they still need insurance, but for taxis they require more insurance than you would have to operate a private vehicle, as they are ferrying passengers. My wife drove Lyft, and the costs went up as well, and it is the reason she stopped. We ran some courier work for a friend of mine, and we stopped that as well, because the money was terrible and it was killing our cars.   Point being there are more taxes and costs for operating a taxi, but not on the car itself. The car itself is taxed and regulated exactly as any other car is. When we drove for Lyft and Uber, we didn’t pay a different tax. Sometimes less tax for deducting fuel costs, but that is it, you can’t deduct the cost of the car for Lyft and Uber.

The harmful ones aren\'t the ones we talk about as being harmful stereotypes. They\'re the ones we just think are true.    For that 20% estimate, I\'m using your definition:   It might be high. But have you spent a lot of time doing political work in a liberal city? The proportion of people who show up to stuff for whom this is a pretty fitting descriptor is much higher than 20%. In coming up with that number, I\'m trying to account for the fact that the people who show up aren\'t really representative of the people writ large, which is something I learned from block walking.   To add some editorializing here, my opinion after four years of consistent involvement in city hall is that no one really knows what\'s going on in their cities, but most people think they do. Generally they tend to default to simple and fundamentally wrong narratives about what\'s going on. That 20% faction is the one whose simple but fundamentally wrong narrative has to do with white supremacy, misogyny, homophobia, and capitalism. Personally, I found them to be the most annoying, because at least the other 80% tended to have more material concerns that could be fixed by policy, like paying too much for property taxes.', 'Yes, and I’m telling you that it’s okay to stereotype people to an extent, because stereotypes are rooted in truths. We’re literally right back where we started, dude.', ' Interesting choice of examples. I think the thing is that basically *every* stereotype has to ring true to some extent, and ""money grubbing Jew"" isn\'t a stereotype that is totally without some basis in reality. (To avoid appearances of anti-semitism, I\'ll add that ""money-grubbing x"" is actually a really common global stereotype applied to any group of people who are perceived as being richer than another group. It\'s easy to see people you think are richer than you as being money-grubbing, whereas your own avarice is just a basic level of respect that everyone should be entitled to). I see ""entitled nice guy"" as not being all that different, to be honest. It has a basis in reality, but it isn\'t descriptive of the majority of men by any stretch of the imagination. It\'s just that the ones who *do* fit that stereotype stand out as being particularly salient, and the existence of an easy narrative to fit them into makes it easy for us to remember those salient examples.   The point is that stereotypes are about perception, and perceptions can both become self-reinforcing on the part of the perceiver *and* influence the behavior of the perceived. How many people aren\'t straight and direct about what they desire because they\'re afraid that said desire might seem to others to be stereotypical of their group? How many men deny that they\'re just interested in a woman for her body because they don\'t want to seem like an objectifying womanizer? Maybe that\'s an aside, but the point is that every group that has stereotypes about itself is aware of those stereotypes, and that awareness impacts how they behave. At least that\'s what I think.    I definitely agree that it isn\'t vanishingly small. Having spent some time being politically active in a very liberal city, my estimate is that about 20% of the coalition that calls itself broadly ""progressive"" or ""liberal"" in the United States fits into that group. Like, I don\'t think it\'s totally fair to tar Barack Obama with that label, but about a fifth of the people who voted for him can be reasonably labeled as SJWs, and probably a similar proportion of the people he might have appointed to cabinet positions.   A fifth isn\'t a useful majority by any stretch of the imagination--not in the way that the 80% of Republicans who identify as ""strongly conservative"" is--but it\'s enough to really impact things, especially since that fifth is the most likely to show up screaming to something, or to throw yogurt on a painting in a museum. People in that category often behave outrageously, and believe outrageous things, so it\'s totally understandable that a significant number of people are outraged by them.   To bring this full circle, I think a big part of the problem with SJWs (sorry for the term) as a group of political actors is that they\'re aware of the stereotype, and use that awareness to deny its validity. ""That\'s just a right-wing, reactionary talking point"" is a common argument against anyone who raises concerns about the behavior of progressive activists. They\'ll use that argument even in the midst of behaving exactly the way Tucker Carlson says they behave.']"
1028	22	1028_thalmor_dragons_skyrim_ldb	['thalmor', 'dragons', 'skyrim', 'ldb', 'empire', 'lore', 'elsweyr', 'ulfric', 'horns', 'wgc']	"['Whether we accept Legends or not, even Skyrim\'s lore has a likely intervention by Boethiah as the turning point of the Great War.   It is that they do not know about the [return of the dragons](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Investigation:_Current_Status). Not that they don\'t know anything about dragons.   I don\'t think you\'re above list of the dragon empire is quite as impressive as you think it is:  Atmora was more of an annexation, the Nords already worshiped the dragons and there are no stories of a war being needed for them to take over.  Akavir being ""conquered"" is dubious and incomplete. At best they only conquered whatever part of the continent the Tsaeci lived on at the time, the extent of which we don\'t know, and were then repelled by the Tsaeci through unknown means. The Kamal, Ka Po\'Tun, and Tang Mo all remained unconquered.  And if we\'re throwing out lore we think is bad, allow me to throw out ESO. The Elsweyr chapter in particular not only takes a hammer to the timeline (which the Dragon war itself already threw into chaos) but its also just bad. It\'s pretty much a copy paste of the Skyrim story complete with their own version of the Greybeards and Dragonrend. Even if we don\'t discount it, Elsweyr was conquered by a different group of dragons and it happened when Elsweyr was split between 16 different kingdoms. The dragons were also defeated by like four dudes.  I don\'t think this paints a picture of a Dragon Army uber weapon. If anything it makes the Falmer look quite weak. The Dwemer, Chimer, Ayleids, Bosmer, Dirreni, and Altmer all seem to be untouched by the dragons. What\'s worse is that after the Nords defeat the dragons, they manage to successfully invade Morrowind, High Rock, and the Nibenay Valley defeating the Chimer, Direnni, and Ayleids. Why could they do this without the dragons, but couldn\'t with them?  We don\'t know much about what the Falmer had at their disposal, or really much about them at all. I don\'t think the fact that they fell is proof that the Altmer don\'t have some trump card against dragons. By most accounts, they\'re the cause for the Void Nights so they\'ve clearly got some powerful mojo. And if we don\'t throw out ESO, we already know the Khajiit have Dragonrend horns.', ' We don\'t talk about Legends. The Thalmor lore in that game is fundamentally nonsensical and the entire thing is told through the perspective of a narrator of questionable reliability.    They conquered Skyrim, Elsweyr, Atmora and Akavir. That\'s a pretty expansive empire.   And conquering Skyrim, by the way, meant going to war with the Falmer too. Whom were elves.   We know for a fact that the Elves don\'t have a trump card when it comes to dragons because there\'s an entire quest in Skyrim about finding out what the Thalmor know about the dragons and the answer is ""basically nothing.""    There is no reason to assume he *required* the Numidium. The US used nukes to force Japan to surrender, that doesn\'t mean they couldn\'t have won conventionally.  Using the Numidium just meant he won with basically 0 casualties. It was extremely helpful, but not *necessary*.', ' It\'s the implication when you say that dragons wouldn\'t be OP because the Thalmor have a ""trump card"" related to them.   He can speak to his own intentions. That is it. But his intentions are no more a valid interpretation of the work than any fans. And any out of game statements that have no bearing in actual in-game sources is pure fanfiction.  Furthermore, It\'s not even clear that he was involved in the writing of anything to do with the Void Nights. He didn\'t work on Skyrim directly, he had an advisory role in the development of that game. That\'s why he\'s uncredited. He certainly wasn\'t personally writing lore books.   No, I don\'t agree with that. I think the Thalmor are presented in Skyrim as being on fairly even footing with the Empire, so an Empire with an army of dragons at its command would be far more powerful.   You too, have a good one.']"

You have to know virtually nothing at all of military history to imagine that this is not so.    A great example comes directly from the US Civil War wherein the top US general, Robert E. Lee, decided to side with the Confederacy and then proceeded to kick the shit out of the Union forces for the first two years of the war *in spite* of having a numerically inferior force that fought with no real resupply in men and materiel.    Lee and Jackson were basically 7 and 0 against the Union until Gettysburg when, through the attrition of terrible generals, the Union, in Meade, finally started fighting with good leadership.    Once Grant and Sherman came back from the west to take over the Army of the Potomac, it was basically game over for Lee and the Confederacy since Grant and Sherman were outstanding leaders who knew how to get shit done.    Again, the point is that senior officers are far more important than anything that happens at the level of junior officers or NCOs.    The lower ranks can have their opinions, but who will command them if they decide to walk away from existing command structure?    You?  Me?  Why should you be in charge when we're the same rank?    Do you see the problem?  It's organizational on a giant scale and there isn't any way that individual actors at the level of junior officers and NCOs can manage it.    Again, sorry to say, but only generals know how to run armies just like only admirals know how to run carrier groups.    You know nothing about military history if you don't recognize that this is true.    As an example, who the fuck do you think, among junior officers and NCOs, is capable of docking an aircraft carrier and getting it fully refueled and resupplied?

Its going to be very hard to break the cycle of people treating you lower than them, taking advantage of your vulnerability, and using subtle ways to put you down such as if you ask a question with the real tone of your voice that you feel and no one takes what your saying seriously. I know this is the way it is for sure in my life. But now lets say you fake being confident. You try your best to keep your sentences direct and to the point, your mind on the goal, you override the negetive “real” self talk with the new “fake” positive self talk even though you deep down dont believe it in that moment.

You get treated like an unconfident guy does, people use subtle ways to indicate you dont have what it takes, you get walked all over daily. You slouch and have a very depressed tone to your voice, you say what you are actually feeling everyday, someone asks how you are you say your not feeling well. People avoid you, you are acting how you truly feel, why are people so cruel? You feel sorry for yourself. Theres no way out.  You talk about your feelings to others, but its leading to them not showing you respect. You dont know how some people just have it all figured out…….      Well heres what may help. Lets say instead of responding to your coworkers at work with a soft and uncomfortable voice, use a direct and assertive voice.(even if you dont feel like this is the true way you feel) your now faking your confidence. Instead of sitting in the corner being quiet and shy while your coworkers are talking about wahatever the fuck, you, while being shy and insecure deep down, go and just start adding to the conversation and give em a smile (you are still hating life at this moment) dont mumble your words quietly, fake being confident.   Now im not saying go and be falsely confident without an end goal, your end goal is to be confident. However you still must keep putting in the work and not only rely on fake confidence, change lifestyle habits and work on other things at the same time. People mistakenly thought i mean act like the movie “catch me if you can” and lie about everything. Im not saying lie about being a Harvard graduate and having a degree, im saying present yourself to be better than you feel. Like dont present depression when depressed(this ones a hard one), dont rely on being a realist because in reality you dont know your limits so keep pushing them.  For my experience, physically presenting/expressing myself as my accurate current abilities at all times is neutral to sometimes leading to a negative outcomes. However physically presenting/expressing myself as someone better than i currently feel inside leads me to positive outcomes. At first it feels strange and wrong but then it eventually leads me to actually feeling confident the next day or maybe 2 days after initially doing the fake confidence thing.

Very similar to how cold GHGs can heat up the warmer surface.  The GHGs are ""powered"" from the IR they absorb. And a microwave oven is powered from the grid. And both can, because of this, despite being cold, heat up a warmer object using radiation alone. And neither violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics.   If you think this is not true, tell me how a microwave oven manage, despite never getting warm, to pop popcorn!   A cold object CAN heat up a warmer object.

Then the net energy transfer can be from a cold object to a warm object.   So, how do you think I am incorrect?"", 'Yes, there actually is ""a plug and socket"" of sorts in the atmosphere.

So the argument that the cold GHGs can\'t warm the surface, because it would violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, is wrong.  Under certain circumstances a cold body CAN heat up a warmer body.  ""Imagine two objects A and B at the same temperature facing each other, they are in equilibrium. In a vaccum with no defined temperature. Now, what will happen if B is colder than A?""   They are at the same temperature, so B is not colder than A. If B is colder than A, then the two objects are not in thermal equilibrium.   A lot of things may happen. It depends on exactly what the objects are and how they can interact via radiation.   If B is a GHG molecule that just absorbed an IR photon from A, it might re-radiate it towards A. Causing A to heat up slightly.   If B is a LED flashlight, with batteries, and is turned on and directed towards A, then the colder B will heat up the warmer A.']"

He isn\'t using monarchy as a foil; he\'s using it as a strawman. He creates a fictionalized version of monarchy by looking only at a narrow portion of history and saying ""the good things that happened in this era of history are because of monarchy, and the bad things that happened are the result of democracy.""   I mean sure, anyone can make a compelling argument for anything as long as they include only favorable evidence and ignore all the contrary evidence.    What does it say about a thought experiment that basically *none* of Hoppe\'s reasoning is borne out in practice? He has all these elaborate and logical chain of reasoning to explain why ""private governance"" under a monarch would lead to better outcomes than ""public governance"" under democracy, and yet *real world evidence doesn\'t support his theorizing.*  For example, he claims that monarchs would have high time preference and therefore a strong incentive to increase the productivity of their subjects; in the real world, there is no evidence of this occurring. In fact, monarchies tended to be the strongest proponents of mercantilism and tightly controlled domestic markets. Modern capitalism wasn\'t invented in a European monarchy, it was invented in the Dutch Republic in the 1600s, and the first country to adopt capitalism outside of the Netherlands was England at a time when the monarchy was historically weak (post Glorious Revolution in 1688) and well on its way to being nothing more than a symbolic figurehead.   Or what, might I ask, would Hoppe make of the Belgian Congo? The King of Belgium claimed Congo as his own personal, ""private property"". Is this not the ""private government"" under a monarch which Hoppe says is preferable to democracy? Why then were conditions in the Belgian Congo so much worse under the King of Belgium than in colonies controlled by democratic countries like France and the UK? (not to say things were all sunshine and rainbows in, say, Kenya or French West Africa, but they weren\'t even close to as terrible as what happened in the Belgian Congo)   And almost all of those alliances and treaties were made by monarchies. WWI started when the Serbian Monarchy, with the backing of the Russian Monarchy, murdered the heir to throne of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, which then chose to launch a war because they had the backing of the German Monarchy, and the German monarchy in turn expanded the war when they chose to invade France (a democratic country) despite the French government having basically no involvement in the July Crisis which immediately preceded the outbreak of war. This German invasion of France and Belgium in turn triggered British involvement---the only democratic country to voluntarily join WWI in 1914.   So which democratic country am I forgetting, specifically? At the very least, WWI shows that monarchies are just as susceptible to bad foreign policy (entangling treaties and alliances) as democracies; at worst, the fact that the outbreak of WWI was caused by monarchies is a damning indictment of monarchy. And Hoppe completely ignores this obvious read of the historical evidence. As you say:   So why then is Hoppe trying to pin the blame for WWI on democracy?', "" Hoppe is literally claiming he not only doesn't need empirical evidence, but empiricism itself is a form of democracy and therefore antithetical to civilisation (since, elsewhere, Hoppe claims democracy is the process of 'decivilisation').   So on what grounds can Hoppe or his apologists object to other people saying the empirical evidence doesn't support Hoppe's theorizing, when Hoppe as already renounced empirical evidence as a category?"", 'Precisely, and yet in pointing out how Hoppe has built in flawed assumptions into the foundation of his theory, which then means the whole theory fails to explain or predict real world results, I\'ve triggered a whole bunch of Hoppe simps elsewhere saying ""Go read Hoppe! You don\'t understand Hoppe!"" without ever being able to explain Hoppe or quote his writings themselves to show me how I\'m wrong.  It\'s as if they have reasoned, a priori, that I must be wrong and therefore no evidence is needed to prove it. You\'re wrong because we\'ve defined you as wrong.']"

Parents feel better because their kid is in a gifted program, but said program is probably much less important to how their kid turns out than the really dominant factor - how rich are the parents?  All these gifted programs separate the kids into “winners” and “losers”. It becomes something of a social stumbling block for the “non-gifted” kids. I actually see this on a daily basis, but it is subtle. Mostly, it’s unnecessary.  Someone once told me that back in the old days they went to a school with no gifted programs. There was just Math, English, History, etc. and everyone took the same classes, went to lunch together, and went to recess. They were all just kids. Behind the scenes kids were actually grouped in classes based on which kids would actually benefit from more rigorous classes. A kid who was really motivated and good at math would be in a class with similar kids, same English, and so on. Thing is, this grouping was mostly invisible to the kids. So the kids could be kids and learn to play together. I think the “invisible” model is probably better for everyone. Because, in reality, being “gifted” doesn’t mean much without personal self-discipline and external resources from parents or other groups. We all need to date, find friends, etc. and the best people may not be academic high achievers.  In this day and age a self motivated kid can learn just about anything on the internet.

No evaporation, condensation or freezing of water, for example.   But when you change the albedo or the radiative forcing of the atmosphere, you change variables not part of the IGL.

Now you seem to introduce a third variable? Albedo!  If the IGL alone is sufficient to describe how the temperature of Earth change, then there can be no change in albedo as a consequence. Because that would also infuence the temperature. As an amplifying feedback. And the prediction using the IGL alone would not be correct.  If you think changes in albedo can have ANY effect on climate, then you say that the IGL alone is not useful for prediciting how the climate and temperature may change.

If you insist that there is saturation, and the IGL is not able to show that, then the results you get from using (only) the IGL are not valid.

Ok so dig this as evidence - on January 5th - **Chuck Grassley accidentally told reporters the plan**. He said that Pence wasn\'t supposed to be there and that he\'d be presiding. Reporters were like wtf old guy talkin bout?   Grassley walked it back a short while later, and everyone sorta forgot about it - as old senator misspoke - nothing bother remembering.   So it\'s worth investigating Ginni Thomas, and probably Chuck Grassley and Barbara Ledeen as well.

The American military government and the Filipino rebels increasingly clashed in latter 1898, with fault and instigation on both sides, which eventually ended in open hostilities.

Could say same about Springsteen, Metallica or any other current top act. They profit tremendously from the monopoly.    Ticketmaster itself makes a pittance on these tours compared to the artists. Swift could play any venue - she doesn\'t need MSG. She could literally play on a landingstrip of an airport and sell out. But the deal with Ticketmaster brings her +$500M from tickets alone and she gets all of it since she has forbidden secondary sales. And that\'s not counting the merch. Ticketmaster is estimated to make $15-20M in comparison. Swift is not at Ticketmaster\'s mercy - the artists and labels just use the monopoly as a convenient money making machine, in which they themselves get the profit.  The Pearl Jam case everyone always keeps brings up is from -95. Let\'s just drop it. It\'s not relevant today.    Edit: Just to clarify. The choice of using ""dynamic pricing"" is up to the artists. They choose this because they want to reap the profits that would otherwise go to secondary sellers. That\'s the part that boosts their bottom line. They can do this because they choose to play on Ticketmaster exclusive venues which forces buyers into the ""dynamic pricing"" tickets.

For example, Plato said, “dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme liberty.” The issue in direct democracy is whether the majority will (or public opinion) will conflict with basic human liberties. If the people are sovereign and have the ease of passing legislation that neglects basic human freedom, then tyranny and dictatorship can ensue. It is in documented history that people often seek power for ends that violate human liberties. And this is just what happened when the public majority sought to empower the Nazi political party on the eve of World War II.”  “The majority viewed Hitler and other key leaders of the Nazi party as heroic and even god-like. This phenomenon, called the cult of personality, happens when a leader, through media avenues, captures the majority public will. Hitler was revered by the majority as a leader who could help pull the country out of post-Treaty of Versailles ruin. Through his popularity and then through brutal force, he was able to gain control of policymaking in Germany with the Enabling Acts of 1933. These acts allowed Hitler to bypass both parliament and the president when creating new German laws. Hitler’s accumulation of power, thanks to his cult of personality, was the reason he was able to rule as sovereign and eventually commit atrocious human rights violations.     To clarify, participatory budgeting in Chicago is not the same as the brutal dictatorships of the 20th century. But we need to call attention to Plato’s warning on the most oppressive tyranny arising from the most basic liberty. The fact is that a vocal majority seeking power for its own end can violate basic human liberties and freedoms.”  https://www.thecollector.com/government-direct-democracy-republic/  Here’s a good read for you. I definitely prefer a republic', 'No, he wasn\'t. There was no ""election.""  Hitler *declared* himself President, also, after Hindenburg\'s death and then held  a referendum on the legality of the policy.

It was *de facto* illegal not be a loyal Nazi at this point, and it was ***literally*** \'on-the-books\' illegal to disapprove of a policy that Hitler\'s government enacted.   A \'No\'  vote on the *policy referendum* was a crime punishable by death or permanent detainment, by the letter of the law, and the vote was done by stormtroopers systematically bringing groups to the polls and forcing them to vote in public. Then on top of this, they flat out cheated and mostly fabricated the turnout of the vote anyway.  Hitler was ***never*** elected.', ""No, he ***literally*** DECLARED himself President. He was not Michael Scott. He was a brutal dictator who used his APPOINTED political minority to violently take power. It wasn't an election. He DECLARED it a POLICY that he was now President.

Adolf Hitler   The referendum only came 2 weeks later, it was not binding, and it was only about whether people APPROVED of this new policy. This is literally all people were asked in the referendum:   Publicly disapproving of a new policy out of Hitler's government was *a crime* punishable by death, though, according to the Enabling Act. The vote was done by stormtroopers marching groups to the polls and forcing them to vote publicly.   Voting 'No' publicly was therefore a capital crime. Most of the brave people that voted 'No' were sent to the concentration camps for their crime. In Nazi strongholds, some were killed right there in the streets.  Hitler was ***NEVER*** elected.""]"

That's the same as #1, but it just doesn't happen at a coordinated point like #1.  So, no, it does not slow traffic down as much as #3.  Sure, in #2, some cars try to open up to allow the merge too quickly, causing traffic to slow more than #1.  We're agreeing that #1 is ideal.  But #3 is far worse for traffic speed through the chokepoint than #2."", 'If you are trying to compare #2 and #3, you cant just assume that in #2 magically everyone preforms a proper zipper, just early, that makes no sence and is not how it happens IRL.   When people merge early, it is, by definition, unpredictable because it is not the proper way to do it, and often against local driving law. The proper way most people are taught is to zipper, meaning move to the end of the merge lane then alternate into traffic.   In #2, the traffic lane must, be definition, not be letting people in from the merge lane, otherwise most cars would simply drive to the end of the merge lane and then merge which is the predictable right thing to do. If they are being forced to merge early, that is because the traffic lane is not leaving enough space so people have to cram in where they can. This causes cars to stop, crating backups.  if cars are cramming in half a mile early, or cramming in at the end of the merge lane, the effect and traffic flow is the same. The only way to reduce unpredictability and stoppage is a proper zipper, and a proper zipper is at the end of the merge lane, which is the expected zipper location, anything outside of that will be short lived and chaotic, or otherwise just be people cutting each other off.  There are countless studies that back up my assertation.  https://www.virginiadot.org/vtrc/main/online_reports/pdf/05-r6.pdf  PROPOSED GUIDELINES FOR APPLICATION  Even though the results of the field tests and the simulations were not directly comparable, they seem to suggest that the percentage of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream plays an important role in the efficacy of the late merge. As a result, the proposed guidelines for application of the late merge focus on the percentage of heavy vehicles.  • Two-to-one configuration. The late merge should be considered for 2-to-1 lane closure configurations to improve throughput when large numbers of heavy vehicles are present (&gt;20 percent) for the majority of the time and congestion and queuing are often present.  • Three-to-one configuration. While the simulation results showed that the late merge significantly improved throughput for all situations, there are no documented evaluations of the deployment of the late merge in this configuration. Further research is needed to determine how the late merge could be deployed in this type of configuration to ensure driver understanding of the signs.', ""let's say hypothetically, in #2, that the lane getting merged into temporarily stops for a merge half a mile before the chokepoint.  this is the worst case scenario for #2 (just assuming the chokepoint is the problem, not other backups).  The cars in the merge lane now have half a mile to speed up and close any gaps between cars.  Now consider that same scenario with #3.  The slowdown and opening up of gaps is right before the chokepoint.  This, unquestionably, slows down throughput through the chokepoint more.  In #2, drivers also tend to have a lot of time to prepare for the merge.  in #3, it is impossible to know where the cars passing will end up in line, so there can't be you lose that preparation.  That means the merge is likely to be worse.  Matching speed makes merges easier.  Think about the speed of the car in #3.  They often are either driving much faster than the lane getting merged into, or run out of road and have to stop.  In #2, cars in the merging lane match the speed of the lane they merge into.  This makes merges smoother.   there is a simple solution that gets #2 pretty close to #1.  cars that want to merge match the speed of the cars in the lane to get merged into.  If you want to encourage a zipper merge and you are in the lane getting merged into, open up the gap as slowly as you can for the car to merge.  opening up the gap slowly delays the merge, getting everything closer to #1.  If you're the one merging, match traffic flow.  if a gap opens up, too early, the damage is already done, merge in.  Its better than that gap closing then opening again.  And still much better than stopping traffic at the merge point.""]"

Reviewing the records of laws and their historical application is a basic skill for a jurist.     Unlike the interpretations that preceded it, Originalism directes a fixed interpretation. It does this by requiring any interpretation be based on the black letter of legally binding text with the definitions of the words at the time using the original public meaning or less commonly the documented intent of authors at the time of their passing.    It solves the problem of Supreme Court justices ignoring the Article V amendment process and modifying the legal meaning of the Constitution at will with neither the consent or input of the legislature, states, or people. Living Constitutionalism is a cancer because it let\'s government expand it\'s own scope and power at will and is explicitly judicial activism because it is modifying law just because a justice think\'s it\'s the right thing to do or that government should have an interest in it.  It has also been around since before Roe. The Federalist Society was formed in response to Roe, which might have you mixed up. Roe was such a horrendously authored case with basically no constitutional basis to the point even RBG admitted it wouldn\'t wold up to scrutiny. Such an egregious act of judicial activism to bend the constitution simply to advance a controversial policy aim caused a raucous among parts of the legal profession.

The report is actually a totally separate issue. And, even there, the report in question was a non-confidential one provided by Perutz and was similar to data from a lecture Watson attended.     By chance, Franklin’s data chimed completely with what Crick had been working on for months: the type of monoclinic unit cell found in DNA was also present in the horse haemoglobin he had been studying for his PhD. This meant that DNA was in two parts or chains, each matching the other. Crick’s expertise explains why he quickly realised the significance of these facts, whereas it took Franklin months to get to the same point.  So basically, a non-confidential report which happened to confirm Crick's existing theory. Right. This isn't the smoking gun of malpractice you think it is.  Again, the accusation that Watson and Crick stole Rosaline's work is largely unfounded. Hence the author's conclusion: "", 'Nobody said nothing about the Nobel Peace Prize award specifically until you brought it up as the arbitrary litmus test for whether or not Rosalind Franklin got the credit she was due. They just said that her contributions were diminished (and in reality actively obfuscated by Watson and Crick) compared to her co-researchers, and she didn’t get proper recognition until after her death.  The original commenter doesn’t say Watson and Crick stole the model, they say Franklin was central to the discovery and evidence for the double helix structure, which is true. Yet she was not credited. What don’t you understand about this?', 'There was no ""Nobel Peace Prize"" there was a Nobel Prize in IIRC Medicine and/or Chemistry.   Same as the Guardian really. The oft repeated line that Watson and Crick stole Rosaline\'s discovery is not really true. They failed to properly credit her for the photo, and she nearly beat them in the race to develop a theoretical model, but *they didn\'t steal anything as far as we know*.   They were cavalier, but never paid a third party to steal the image, or whatever weird stuff people accuse them of. Fundamentally, Rosaline got jibbed, but how and to what extent is not obvious and hinges on questions we simply do not know the answer to. Example, the photo. How did Watson and Crick get it?  The account I have read suggests that Wilkins gave it to them after Rosaline had made it public at a 1951 lecture. If this is the case, then no, Watson and Crick didn\'t really do anything malicious as far as I know.  Your own post here is really a distillation of the problem.

She loved the hotel, but she didn’t love her room, “so she had her designer go over, and they redecorated the room to be a little more like her home,” Pentek said, estimating the request cost to be more than $100,000.  Back in 2004, you could still find celebrities and royalty checking out gear in places like the Four Seasons Resort in Jackson Hole — which opened that year. That opening season, Matt Wolfe, now a real estate adviser for Engel &amp; Volkers Salt Lake City, says he was working in the Wyoming resort’s ski shop when he was asked to wax custom skis for Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud.  “The men in the entourage wouldn’t wear our maroon ski boots because they thought that color was feminine or something,” Wolfe said of the prince’s traveling party. “We actually ended up putting them in women’s boots because they were black.”  Nights in a fully staffed chalet mansion   For the richest skiers, preferences vary when it comes to accommodations. Some want fully staffed mountain mansions, like the $30,000-a-night chalet that the luxury travel company Remote Lands books for clients in Niseko, Japan’s premier ski resort.  “It’s just massive and it has everything you can possibly imagine in it,” Remote Lands CEO Catherine Heald said.  Other people prefer to book an entire resort. Nadine Paulo of Travel Edge buys out the whole Sheldon Chalet in remote Alaska for clients willing to pay $75,000 for up to four people for a three-night minimum stay.  Of course some people would rather buy a property (or a room) at a resort.  “We have several billionaires who own here,” Tolman said of Stein Eriksen, where all rooms are individually owned.  Some skiers stay at their rooms all season; some rent them out part of the time. Tolman knows of one owner who bought the property without seeing it, remodeled it and has still never been.  “Just probably had to park $5 million somewhere,” he said.  No one’s too big for a condo   At the Yellowstone Club — where some property sells for more than $1 million an acre — Vullo says members are willing to spend exorbitant amounts for townhouses and condos with easy access to resort amenities and ski runs instead of bigger, stand-alone homes on ranches.  He was fascinated by his clients, two brothers, who bought a pair of three-bedroom condos next to each other despite their penchant for hosting big groups. “You see friends and family sleeping on the couch of your $12 million condo when you could have had a badass ski house somewhere else, but people pay that for being in there,” Vullo said.  Friedman sees a similar demand from certain celebrity clients of Onefinestay.  “We get a lot of country music artists in [Steamboat Springs, Colo.] and they love staying in condos,” Friedman said. “It’s close to the lift, they can walk to the lift. They just don’t want big homes.”  correction  A previous version of this article misstated the amount it cost to rent the entire Sheldon Chalet in Alaska. Because of a recent price increase, buy-outs now start at $75,000 for up to four people for a minimum three-night reservation. This article has been corrected.', 'If resort snow won’t do, there’s heli-skiing to fresh powder.  “We have a helipad about 300 yards away from the hotel,” said Bryan Woody, general manager at Madeline Hotel &amp; Residences in Telluride, Colo. “The more experienced skiers will generally go out with a professional in a helicopter to ski the backcountry.”  Story continues below advertisement  Michael Friedman, COO of the luxury vacation rental company Onefinestay, arranges those services in Aspen. The package costs $19,000 to $27,000 for groups of one to four.  And for a truly off-the-grid experience, Manabu Ainai, director of Hoshino Resorts’s properties in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, says they’ve taken clients to ski in places you can’t find on Google Maps.  For the 1 percent, a ski instructor isn’t someone you see once a season for an afternoon crash course. Some tutors collect more than $1,000 a day to work with a single client for weeks at a time.  “I might just be one-on-one for 40 days with a person,” said James P. Ruddy — a former elite ski instructor who worked at the Yellowstone Club for 16 years, as well as other premier resorts like Park City’s luxury Deer Valley Resort. “You truly become part of their family. You’re an integral part of someone’s vacation.”  Story continues below advertisement  “They’ll pay $1,300 a day, plus the tip, just so they don’t have to wait in the lift line.”  A big trend in the industry is setting up private sessions with Olympic skiers. At Onefinestay, Friedman says they get a lot of requests from clients who want to work with Olympians at a rate of $2,800 per person, for a full day, or $1,700 for a half day.  Some travelers hire professionals to share the special privileges resorts give to instructors, not their expertise.  “They’ll pay $1,300 a day, plus the tip, just so they don’t have to wait in the lift line,” said Berkely Tolman, who has worked for 16 years at the ski-in, ski-out Stein Eriksen Lodge, a section of Utah’s Deer Valley resort where nightly rates average $2,000 most of the winter.  Skipping the line may seem valuable at a huge ski resort where lifts may have 30-minute waits, but Deer Valley doesn’t allow a ton of skiers at a time.  Story continues below advertisement  “At the busiest times, I’ve never once in my life waited more than maybe 10 minutes to get on a chairlift,” Tolman said.  8 ski vacations that check every travel style  Hiring film crews to make family movies   It can be a hassle to interrupt precious travel memories by taking your own photo, and even more so when you’re trying to ski down a mountain. But the ultrawealthy have a solution.  “A lot of people like to have a photographer and a videographer with them to capture the moment,” said Naomi Mano, president and CEO of the Tokyo-based luxury travel company Luxurique Inc. “They don’t want to be the ones holding a selfie stick; they want somebody to photograph every moment of their experience.”  Mano said these professionals have filled a job that used to be left to butlers, nannies and other helpers. Many task Luxurique with hiring people to document their entire trip, which can cost more than $1,000 a day per photographer. After the vacation, it’ll cost another couple thousand to put together a photo book.  “It’s for those people who wouldn’t hesitate to put an extra twenty, thirty thousand dollars on their trip,” Mano said.  How to ski like a local in a mountain resort town  Requests for pink snow, a live elephant   To make their ski trips as romantic as possible, ultrawealthy couples spare no expense.  Patrick Davila, general manager of Aspen’s Hotel Jerome, remembers a couple who requested a staff member follow them around on a snowmobile to carry their champagne. Alexandra Vesin, general manager at Aman Le Mélézin in Courchevel, France, says the property has arranged a marriage proposal in a hot-air balloon over the Alps.']"

So they don\'t want proof, no. Nor is your inability to provide proof of innocence an indictment. If your alibi is that you were alone at home and no one can testify to it you\'re still not assumed to be guilty. It\'s not proof of your guilt. You\'re not grasping this analogy very well.   Yes, you literally are proven innocent. That\'s how our justice system works. There was never any CREDIBLE REASON to believe you DID THE CRIME. Ergo, you are PROVEN innocent. Because we do not ASSUME YOUR GUILT. How do you not get this?   With no proof this is true, ergo the claim is spurious, and with AMPLE proof it is not true. Provided above. You want additional videos of Uyghurs enjoying their culture in Xinjiang? Because I can find them. It\'s not that hard. You can also find them. On YouTube. Random ass tourists enjoying Xinjiang. Random ass Uyghurs talking about cuisine. Random ass Han enjoying Uyghur culture.    You went, ""They\'re accused of erasing their culture"" to ""native children were killed"". How are these two related? Are you accusing the PRC of killing children in Xinjiang\'s schools? I\'m *trying* to be charitable here, but you are not making it easy.   As a rule, we should define what things are and describe them accurately when engaged in a discussion about things. It is mandatory that children attend schools in almost every nation on Earth. These schools are not prisons. Prisons are a different second thing.  You\'re correct that what we call it doesn\'t negate any atrocities committed there, IF THERE WERE ANY ATROCITIES COMMITTED THERE. Yes.    Guantanamo Bay is literally a prison. It\'s a military prison. No one has any confusion about that. When you ask questions like this you should try to flesh them out into actual arguments.   If I had no credible evidence to suspect you committed the crime in the first place--yes. Unequivocally yes. That\'s HOW our justice system works. That\'s how MOST justice systems work. If the person who accused you of the crime is shown to have fabricated the evidence--also yes. Absolutely yes.   Prove to me that a single school in Xinjiang stripped anyone of their religion. There are more Mosques in Xinjiang now than ever, state-sponsored schools teach new generations of Imams. No one has been stripped of Islam in Xinjiang. Radical terrorists—  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is the reason you brought up human sacrifice among Indigenous Americans and the reason you\'re arguing about extremism and religion that you think that de-radicalizing Salafist jihadists and stopping them from bombing marketplaces full of civilians and cutting people up with machetes in the streets and assassinating Imams and terrorizing women for not wearing the hijab--that you think this constitutes genocide?   You\'re saying that trying to stop extremism infiltrating your community is the same as genocide? That\'s an argument you\'re making? Because yeah, if you defined it that way--sure. No one does, though. And it would be horribly insulting to the actual victims of actual genocides and it would be a stupid, stupid, ridiculous bar that would make every nation on earth constantly guilty of genocide.   Would make the word meaningless.   &lt;.&lt;   No one is stripping anyone of their religion. You persist in arguing from these strong claims as though they were true and have provided nothing approaching evidence to support them.   Whereas above, linked in the OP, is actual evidence Islam is thriving in Xinjiang. You could also google that, look around a bit. See that Islam is not, in any way, being persecuted in Xinjiang. Radical terrorism is.   If my ""religion"" is that I\'m going to bomb you and murder your family, you could CLAIM that holding me and my group of extremists in custody is some kind of genocide. It\'d be fucking stupid, though. That isn\'t a religion. That\'s an extremist, terrorist ideology. If acting against those constitutes a genocide, EVERY STATE ON EARTH is doing genocide.    No, *it isn\'t*. The requirement is **REASONABLE** suspicion. For them to come into your home and tear that motherfucker apart looking for evidence requires **REASONABLE** suspicion. It\'s in the Fourth Amendment, my dude. It\'s what that WHOLE thing is about.    No. That you have *REASONABLE* suspicion that a COURT of your PEERS would find REASONABLE to WARRANT that ACTION. Otherwise it becomes HARASSMENT, literally. Cops in this country are not allowed to run your pockets and rip up your car any time they *suspect* you. Anytime they have *any reason*. They have to have a *reasonable suspicion* that a JURY and JUDGE would find *reasonable*.   Nope. If they don\'t have a reasonable suspicion, doesn\'t *matter* if you\'re the ""main suspect"", they won\'t get a warrant from a judge. At least, when the shit is working properly.   Nah, it isn\'t. Never how it has. Except in cases where racism and other bullshit was involved. But it\'s not how the principle works. Not how it works for rich white folks or corporations.   Anywho. I think we\'re about done here.', ' Except there\'s no evidence *of* a genocide, and they\'re not *hiding* anything. Xinjiang is a *tourist* location. Cambodia *was* trying to hide their genocide, they didn\'t celebrate Chinese or Vietnamese culture. The very nature of committing a genocide is that you despise the culture you\'re targeting. There is an ideological motivation behind it. One which can be evidenced. None is evidenced here.   Article is linked in the video. &lt;3   The US lies when they visit Israel. The evidence *there* is everywhere. There\'s a reason most nations on the planet and the UN unequivocally condemn Israel\'s actions regarding Palestine. The evidence in Xinjiang is non-existent. Even the Western media has admitted to that, in so many words.  It went from ""bodily genocide"" claims, which were completely unevidenced, to ""cultural genocide"" claims which are *completely unevidenced*, which are contradicted by China placing Uyghur culutral traditions on the UNESCO world heritage roster, and by them celebrating, promoting, and protecting Uyghur and Kazakh and Hui culture, to claims of ""museumification"" or ""commodification"" of Uyghur culture. Which is meaningless.  Uyghur books are sold in book stores, tourists visit Xinjiang daily, Uyghur dance is celebrated (and China has added it to the UNESCO roster), Uyghur music is celebrated, both are taught in state schools, Islam is taught in state schools, there are more mosques than ever before, etc.   In short, there was never any concrete evidence for the Western media\'s claim to begin with. The accusations came, almost exclusively, from two sources: the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and Adrian Zenz. Neither are reliable. Neither are reputable. ASPI is a think tank that is funded by a dozen military industrial contractors, and the US government directly, and Adrian Zenz is an ideologically motivated notorious propagandist.  The media just doesn\'t care. There is a definite and demonstrable bias where the average Western outlet will lower its standards and uncritically amplify baseless stories about ""enemy"" nations.   The 2014 article from the BBC is important to point out that terrorism, massive, widespread terrorism *really did* exist in Xinjiang according to even Western sources. Mass stabbings of hundreds of people, moderate imams being assassinated in broad daylight, bombings of the capital, all done by ""East Turkistan"" separatists. Radical Wahhabist/Salafist terrorists who the US supported. Who were cutting people\'s ears off for being drunk, who were bullying women into wearing the hijab, who were killing moderate muslim clerics who were speaking out against them.  In this context China *did* crackdown in Xinjiang, after decades of terrorism. They *did* force radicals who expressed terrorist sympathies into schools. They *did* make sure they learned Mandarin, a trade, and the law of China. They *did* imprison those who committed violent acts. And they *admit* to this.   It\'s an example to the world, imo. A humane way to combat terrorism. As China themselves say, you give these people a trade, a future, and they will turn away from extremism. If they have a good life, they won\'t want to sacrifice it doing stupid shit.  We reported on it in the worst possible light. China had a massive terrorism problem and built schools. The US got hit by terrorism and bombed an entire region of the world for twenty years.  Anywho, you can visit Xinjiang if you doubt it. People do. Kashgar and Urumqi are tourist destinations. People hike in Xinjiang. People camp in Xinjiang. People live in Xinjiang. People who live Xinjiang, some of them, make Youtube content. Tourists post videos, etc.  The *worst* thing I\'ve heard from reputable sources was that Uyghurs were getting searched a lot at border checkpoints.  Seriously, the best evidence to contradict the narrative is put forward by China on CGTN. They admit to what they did, they show why they did it, and they show how successful it was.  They also show how much more prosperous and successful Xinjiang is now, including Uyghurs and Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities within Xinjiang.  EDIT: Regarding your reply, you can\'t show proof something has never happened. You can\'t prove a negative, most often--and you don\'t have to. The burden is on your opponent to prove the positive.

You accuse someone of genocide and then don\'t trust them when they show you video evidence it didn\'t happen? That\'s absurd. Of course we should listen to what China says, even if we don\'t believe it--they\'re the one being accused. That would be like accusing someone of murder and discarding their testimony out of hand (or refusing to even hear it) because they\'re the suspect. We have an obligation to listen to what China says in their defense if we want to take this issue even remotely seriously.    Doesn\'t map. The Spanish *were* engaged in a cultural genocide. As was the US in relation to Indigenous populations and Afro-Americans.   China isn\'t replacing the culture of minorities in Xinjiang--so the analogy is meaningless. Fails entirely to map.   Salafism is not native to Xinjiang. Hasn\'t existed there in the thousands of years Islam has been around. Islam has existed in China for almost as long as Islam has existed *anywhere*.   Also worth noting the vast majority of Muslim nations have spoken out in China\'s defense over these accusations of genocide.    Michelle Bachelet met with the leaders of the XUAR, visited a re-education school, visited a prison, toured Xinjiang, and gave it virtually nothing but glowing praise. There is no investigation because there is no *credible claim* that there is *anything* to be investigated.   Leftists were up in arms because the US invaded a sovereign nation. If *Afghanistan* had started re-educating Afghans in a secular and non-genocidal way, leftists would absolutely not be ""up in arms"".  Edit: You raise an interesting point. The US *did* re-educate Afghans. We propped up a puppet government and built them schools and educated them according to our desires. That was not the part most leftists had a problem with. The invading a sovereign nation and sticking around for decades predicated on a lie was.    Yes. The guy\'s commentary is *about* how the article is evidence.    Answered it since the beginning. All you had to do was go look at the article. I am not your tutor.   Because that\'s not how claims of guilt *work*. If you don\'t *know* if someone is guilty, they\'re *not* guilty. If you don\'t *know* if there is an unreasonable and unevidenced thing that exists, it is *as good* as knowing it does not.  It\'s basic logic. Hitchen\'s razor in this case. A claim made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.  Not only is the evidence so weak we can dismiss the claim, we *know* for a **fact** no genocide is occurring. Again, you can go look at Xinjiang. You can go visit Xinjiang. You can watch tourists visiting Xinjiang. You can listen to people who live in Xinjiang. No evidence of genocide, and the positive absence of it. I.e. Uyghurs freely living their lives, and actively engaging in their culture without reprisal. I.e. no genocide. This evidence *strongly precludes* the **possibility** of a genocide. If people are A) not being killed, and B) not having their culture torn away from them but are very much alive and enjoying their culture, we can conclude they are not actively being genocided.   It\'s not rocket science. Trust in the basics here.  The actual Uyghurs who live in actual Xinjiang do not exist in an alternate dimension or on Mars. They can speak for themselves, and you can literally ask them. In person.  My apologies for my tone. I get it. It’s hard to find those resources. Googling this yields endless results of MSM spreading the same baseless horseshit. You want YouTube videos of random western tourists meandering around Kashgar or Urumqi and talking to Uyghurs who are clearly not experiencing a genocide? I can produce dozens. You want Han and Uyghurs who live in Xinjiang showing how ridiculous the narrative is? Those also exist.   The question you have to ask yourself is what burden of proof that something doesn’t happen is acceptable to you? Because there exists an unattainable horizon there. I can’t prove every single existing Uyghur never experienced a single “genocidal” act, for instance. But that is a very unreasonable burden. Genocide, as defined, is systemic and intentional. A plan or pogrom which brings about the destruction of a national, religious, ethnic, or racial group in whole or in part. I can prove that shit didn’t happen. Already have.']"

A giant cube is a structure that could be used for a variety of purposes, from scientific research to entertainment purposes. It could also be used as a place to house people in the event of a disaster or a place to explore the unknown.   The most important reason why we should build a giant cube is that it could be used for scientific research. Scientists could use the cube to conduct experiments in a variety of fields, from space exploration to medical research. With its large surface area, the cube could be used to create different environments and explore the effects of different conditions on various substances. Moreover, the cube could be used to study the effects of gravity on different materials and test theories about the universe.   Additionally, the cube could also be used for entertainment purposes. It could be used as a large theatre or concert hall, providing people with a unique experience. It could also be used for large events like festivals, conferences, and trade shows. The cube could be used to create a unique atmosphere and provide people with a new way to experience the world.    Furthermore, the cube could be used as an emergency shelter. In the event of a disaster, such as an earthquake or hurricane, the cube could provide a safe place for people to stay. It could also be used as a temporary home for those affected by disasters. The cube would provide a safe place to live, and it could also be used to store supplies and provide medical attention.   Finally, the cube could be used to explore the unknown. It could be used to explore the depths of the ocean or the surface of Mars. The cube could provide a unique way to explore the universe and discover new things.    In conclusion, there are many compelling reasons why we should build a giant cube. It could be used for scientific research, entertainment purposes, as an emergency shelter, and to explore the unknown. The cube would provide a unique way to experience the world and it could be used to make new discoveries. Therefore, it is clear that building a giant cube is a project worth pursuing.']

That lead to the heart conditions that ultimately killed him. Of course holding a person face down on a hard surface reducing lung expansion didn't help with the already bad health condition, but they were trying to restrain him until emt arrived since he was hysterical due to the drugs. They didn't know what exactly he took at the time, but they just knew he must have been on something. He unfortunately died in the process. Watch the body cams. You can see the events unfold and hear what they were saying and see what they were doing. All Chauvin really did was showed up with Thao after Floyd was already on the ground and helped Lane and Keung restrain him as they called for emt. It looks like mostly negligence. Imho I think Floyd was going to die anyway for ingesting the fentanyl. They needed to get it out of his system fast, but they had no idea since of course Floyd refused to let them know. His drug dealer and girlfriend that was with him didn't say anything either. We hear about how small doses of fentanyl can kill people yet everybody ignores the fact Floyd had enough in his body to kill a horse. And he's a big dude. The whole dam  thing was sensationalized.   And yes Chauvin was the veteran officer there with Thao being the 2nd longest on tbe force and the two younger guys being Lane and Keung who were the first to apprehend Floyd. No one showed up to kill Floyd that day. It was a series of unfortunate circumstances that lead to it, a fake $20 bill call that ultimately turned out it wasn't fake.""]"

That gas *could potentially* add more heat to the barrel instead, but gas isn't *nearly* as good at transferring that heat as brass is. Also in theory the gas is moving faster this way, so that's less time to transfer that heat so it might balance out.

I also know that the heat transfer through brass will heat up the whole chamber and—subsequently—the barrel much faster, so the theory that polymer absorbs the heat or does not transfer it as it is ejected makes sense.

In my comments i was merely highlighting how a stakeholder is merely a category and shareholder is a subset of that category. But it seems as if i replied my original comment to the wrong person.', ' No, that is not correct. I have no objections on a semantic level whether stakeholders does or does not include shareholders.  What I object to is the idea that people who do not spend money purchasing a share of a company should in any way be considered ""owners"" in that company or have any decision making powers whatsoever, such as votes. Whether we call these people stakeholders or not is totally irrelevant. But I think you and I can both agree these people are probably best called stakeholders. Unless you like a different definition, I suggest we stick with it.  And if that\'s our definition, then *obviously* stakeholders includes shareholders. It will also include other people. If you want a different definition such that stakeholders and shareholders are synonymous (rather than the one being a superset of the other), we can have that conversation, and it will result in the same underlying conclusions.

The other person replied that only shareholders should have votes. Then you replied that stakeholders would include shareholders. This is an obvious point that no one was disputing, so it was useless to bring it up. The real question is not nor ever was about whether shareholders should get a vote. It was about whether the extra people who are stake holders but *not* shareholders should get a vote. And we say no, they shouldn\'t.  British citizens have a *stake* in american elections, since our foreign policy very much bleeds into theirs. But does that mean British citizens should have a vote in american elections? It is the same with company meetings. I fully comprehend that many people who don\'t own shares in a company have some sort of stake in the company. Maybe the company is their employer. Maybe a company is their supplier, or in a chain of their supplier\'s. Do these people get a vote on the board? no. They don\'t. It\'s not their property.

Is any one person calling themselves a *survivor* more or less valid than another calling themselves the same under different circumstances? What is your opinion on a hypothetical situation in which someone has the right to call themselves a survivor, as opposed to when they're just a victim?"", ""The use of life-like was an error on my part. Since our discussion revolves around domestic abuse, my hypothetical situation is more relevant to the subject matter than an act of robbery; that's what I meant.  I'll concede that point, though I wasn't intending to make such a conclusion.  If the word 'doesn't seem quite right', surely that's just your interpretation and has nothing to do with the word's meaning. The issue with your analogy of someone 'surviving' their trip to the shops is that it doesn't fit the aforementioned definition. To say 'one continued to function or prosper despite their trip to the shops' isn't accurate as the act of going to the shops isn't inherently dangerous. Sure, there's a lot of potential for danger in going to the shops (getting hit by a car, tripping over your lace, getting robbed in an alleyway) but the likelihood is overwhelmingly low and a 'trip to the shops' doesn't evoke considerations of personal safety. That's precisely why you're correct in your analysis that applying survivorship to something so mundane.  Domestic abuse is an entirely different matter, though. Within a domestic abuse scenario, there not only exists a heightened potential for danger - that danger is very real, as it manifests in the 'abuse' we're discussing. Without the realisation of the potential for danger, it wouldn't be domestic abuse, would it? This 'abuse' is characterised by a multitude of idiosyncratic dimensions (physical, psychological, financial, etc.) that are tied together by an intention of upholding an unhealthy, hierarchal relationship dynamic. My point in citing the different dimensions is that we can't restrict 'danger' to physical acts, as psychological damage can be just as (or more) damaging as a punch or a kick."", ""In your first proposed scenario, there is nothing wrong with referring to the hypothetical person as a victim.   In your second proposed scenario, I agree that given the context of violent assault, we'd classify that person as a survivor as their life was in peril.  In your third proposed scenario, again, I agree that attributing survivorship to an act like that would be disingenuous.  Within your three proposals, there exists a single act of determined harm from which we base our ascription off of (i.e. the person experienced **an** act of robbery \\[**likely not life-threatening**\\] and is therefore a victim).  Would things change if the *single* act was replaced by a *sequence* of actions? If someone keeps robbing you, are you still a victim? Given that robberies can usually be *avoided* rather simply and are not explicitly life threatening, yes, you're still a victim.  What if the *sequence* of actions was in a context that couldn't easily be *avoided*? You might say that people in abusive relationships/households can just leave, but it's not so black-and-white. So the situation cannot be easily *avoided*. Does a *sequence* of actions that one is *forced* to bear justify claims of survivorship? Or is the person still a victim since their life isn't in immediate danger?  Suffering is entirely subjective. Domestic Abuse is a hell that seems inescapable. When one manages to escape, isn't it valid for them to call themselves (and for us to refer to them as) survivors?  People who go through domestic abuse aren't really comparable to people who go through a robbery or people who have their fingers broken (even intentionally). Those who go through domestic abuse often times have their entire worldviews shifted in a perverse manner, with the psychological trauma they receive lasting far longer than the duration of abuse. As such, I think it's important to be mindful of the language we decide to use.""]"

I created a map that has just the states that are absolutely safe for both parties. I left off AZ, NV, NM, MN, WI, MI, GA, NC, PA, NH, and ME. At this point, Democrats have 203 EVs and Republicans have 218, with 117 uncounted. If Trump is on the ballot in any of those swing states, the Democrat will easily win the state, because Trump and the Republican will split the vote. So Trump would have to stay off the ballot in at least half of the swing states in order for the nobody-gets-270 scenario to occur. I agree with you that Trump's not out for anyone but himself, but let's assume that he stays off (or can't get on) the ballot in enough swing states to not automatically throw the election to the Democrats and the swing states break in a way that leads to a 270-268 Republican win. In order to peel off an EV from the Republicans, Trump would have to run and win in one of those 4 extremely Republican states I mentioned in an earlier comment.   So to recap, the following would all have to occur:  * Trump rejects or is denied ballot access in enough swing states to keep the Democrat from automatically winning (67 EVs worth) * The swing states break roughly evenly, maybe with a slight D lean * Trump wins at minimum 1 of 4 extremely Republican states, depending on how the swing states break. Again, these are the only states he could possibly win with both a Democrat and Republican also on the ballot.   I agree it's technically possible, but the amount of control that would be needed to manage that chaos is really really high. It's been fun to hypothesize about though.  edit: shit, I forgot to mention that it's also extremely unlikely that the House of Representatives would choose Trump over the Republican nominee. And really, in a scenario where Trump and the Republican combine for 270+ EVs, there wouldn't have to be much shenanigans going on for the House to choose the Republican to be president.

Grow up.', '\\-Homeschooling creates activists for the far right:  \\-No, far right parents create far right children, who may or may not participate in some form of activism. Just like far left parents are far more likely to raise far left kids, and centrist parents are far more likely to raise centrist children. If schools actually taught about politics, maybe they could be as effective at turning kids away from far right ideologies as they are at teaching kids misinformation. But they don’t. They do, however, teach patriotism and nationalism, which, if anything, is more likely to support a far right ideology in the mind of a child than it is to discourage it.  \\-Homeschooling gives parents more control over their kids:  \\-In theory, depending on the parent (a true anarchist parent wouldn’t take advantage of or accept that control). But public school doesn’t eliminate that possibility for control. It just gives it to the government/schools/teachers. And a teacher will use that control. Because they are told to, and they have to somehow teach 30 kids all the same material at the same time.  \\-Public education socializes kids:  \\-No. Participating in society socializes kids. The only reason public school kids get most of their socialization at school is because that is where they spend most of their time. And is the socialization they are getting actually good? Be quiet, don’t talk, sit still, listen, do as I say, follow the rules, line up, follow me, don’t engage in risky play, don’t experiment, follow the directions, do only what the rules say, if you break the rules you are bad. Is that what we want kids to learn? Is that how we want them to be socialized? As a homeschooler, you can socialize your kids with way more diversity. You can take them to homeschool coops (they are really common, not just something a very small percentage of homeschoolers do), sports, arts, the playground, protests (if they’re safe), etc. Socializing kids isn’t that hard. Sure, they might be “weird.” That’s because they haven’t been bullied into conformity. Personally, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. And my AuDHD, trans, anarchist ass was gonna be a weirdo regardless of where I was educated (in my case, it was public school). Frankly, I say let your freak flag fly. Embrace your weird, because there ain’t a normal one among us.  \\-Public education has led to some people becoming leftists:  \\-Sure. And it has led some to be right wingers. So what?  \\-How do we shift homeschooling towards the left and remove right wing control?  \\-Simple: more anarchists, and leftists in general, need to homeschool their own kids. The more of us who homeschool, the less control the right has.', '\\-The education system in the US is broken:  \\-Yes, it is. And yes, it’s not for the reasons the right-wingers think it is. When your job is literally to teach children to read and illiteracy rates are as high as they are in the US, there is a problem. Even if there were no other issues with the education system, I think that would be reason enough to consider homeschooling. After all, reading is one of the most fundamental skills needed to simply survive in our society.  \\-The homeschooling movement is deeply connected to the right wing:  \\-I can understand this concern. Early homeschool advocates were concerned formal schools were oppressive and only taught kids to be compliant employees (John Holt) and that early education was detrimental to a child’s development (Raymond Moore). However, in the 1980s, rightwing Christians co-opted the movement so that they could basically indocrinate their kids into their own belief system. There is no doubt that that is wrong. And for a while most homeschool curricula that were available pushed those agendas. Unfortunately, that control lasted through the 90s. However, as homeschooling has gained popularity, the Christian Nationalists have a lot of their control. This has a lot to do with the internet. It’s a lot harder to avoid differing ideas/opinions if you have any access to the internet. Yes, there are still a lot of Christian Nationalist homeschools, some of whom are even worse than the Duggars. But that doesn’t make them the majority. And there are great homeschool curricula out there that would struggle to find acceptance within a public school classroom (not that a curriculum is necessary to teach kids). The pandemic in particular did a lot to remove a lot of control that was once held by the right. In the US, homeschooling went from about 3-4% of the population before the pandemic to 11% by the fall of 2020. Most of those people were homeschooling due to health concerns. Many of those families did return to public school, but many did not. More people now have a far more positive view of homeschooling as a result.

Even with small children, usually the whole thing is checked upon in advance by the parents asking or knowing whether or not the kid would be interested in having a pet in the family.  2. A dog as a gift doesn\'t mean people wrap it like a present and put it in a box. The animal doesn\'t even have to be present on that day - It can be as simple as  telling family members ""Hey remember when we talked about getting a dog? Yes we are! We have had discussions with that breeder/shelter and we will adopt a puppy! We don\'t know which puppy, we have to go and look at them first and see if they have one for us. We have an appointment next week!"" And there you go.  3. Legally, pets are almost things. They are sold in stores. If you have one, you are called a pet *owner*. It\'s yours, you can sell it or gift it if you want. Pets have some rights, as it\'s illegal to abuse or abandon a pet. But that\'s it. Buying, gifting or selling a pet is not abusive per se, especially not if the whole deal is for the benefit of the pet. If someone adopts a dog from a kill shelter on Christmas and gifts it to their dad who always had dogs and talked forever about having a dog again, that\'s a net benefit for the dog.', 'Did you now graduate from ""pets shouldn\'t be Christmas presents"" to ""Teenagers will lose interest in everything except technology"", suggesting teenagers or kids shouldn\'t get a pet, like at all?  Meanwhile you are a teenager and you do have a pet. Of course kids can lose interest in pets sometimes, and they get annoyed with the chores that come with the pet - that\'s why I\'d say it\'s a bad idea to push the whole responsibility of taking care of a pet onto a not fully grown human with no safeguards.  &amp;#x200B;   I get what you are saying - there are these cases of people getting pets for Christmas willy-nilly without thinking about the consequences. Just like some people got a puppy when lockdown started because they felt lonely, without thinking about the consequences once lockdown ends and they are no longer working from home. But like, that\'s not everyone. Yes, some people are assholes and get pets without thinking, buying from sketchy breeders, not taking care of them properly and all that. But at the same time, there are many responsible pet owners.   All people here are saying is: yes it is bad to get a pet without thinking it through. Yes it is a bad idea to surprise someone with a living breathing creature. Yes it is a bad idea to introduce a pet to a new home when there are a lot of people around and it\'s noisy and chaotic. But this has nothing to do with whether or not it\'s Christmas, or any other holiday for that matter.   But it\'s okay to get a pet if you think it through, everyone is on board, you buy from a responsible breeder or adopt from a shelter, you have prepared for the arrival of the pet, you safely introduce the pet to the new home, you are educated and willing to care for the pet correctly. Then get a pet - doesn\'t matter if you do it on Christmas or not.']"

In 2005, Brian Kalt, a professor at Michigan State University, published an article ""The Perfect Crime"" describing how no crimes committed in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park would be constitutionally prosecutable because of these constitutional clauses. An excerpt from Prof. Kalt\'s article is below: ""Say that you are in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone, and you decide to spice up your vacation by going on a crime spree. You make some moonshine, you poach some wildlife, you strangle some people and steal their picnic baskets. You are arrested, arraigned in the park, and bound over for trial in Cheyenne, Wyoming before a jury drawn from the Cheyenne area. But Article III, Section 2 plainly requires that the trial be held in Idaho, the state in which the crime was committed. Perhaps if you fuss convincingly enough about it, the case would be sent to Idaho.

We get a lot of weird color variations and twins/triplets in the population too so the genetic diversity is an issue as well. So the DNR either has to trap 40-50 every year and relocate or cull them.

Existence itself doesn’t exist as a phenomena within existence, since, well since it’s existence. I see a distinction between what can be observed within existence and existence itself.  Lightning isn’t a concept, nor the sun, but observable within reality. Even if we were to explain how reality was, we would then find ourselves struggling to explain how our *new* reality, in which we knew what reality was, existed - ad infinitum. That process in itself has no end at which we may sit back and point at the completed, written-out formula - not because we cannot develop one, but because that process by nature is infinite. I agree that our inability to explain observable phenomena within reality cannot be used to prove a God. However, the distinction between what we perceive and the concept of reality itself are too foreign to be subject to the same sort of inquiry.', ' I grew up reading mythology, the fantastic evidence is infinite.     The Bible is not a science text. Along with the other ancient accounts it does discuss cosmology but on its own terms. Have you heard of ""Iron Man"" (opposite of ""Straw Man"") regarding an argument? It is important to give the ancients a lot of room and assistance when interpreting. As a perennialist I tend to the [cyclical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model#See_also) most common with the ancients but the Bible sounds more like the Big Bang (Ex Nihilo).   What I am saying is more like fractal math and multiverse and certain ideas about reality being a ""hologram matrix"" or other edgy scientific views. It does not fit with Reductive Materialism and is rooted in Ancient philosophy.   It all comes down to worldviews, [we can look at anything from many different perspectives.](https://jainworld.com/education/jain-education-material/jain-stories/elephant-and-the-blind-men/)', 'That stands for Ancient Near East cosmology. I only brought it up because I had to look it up. It’s the idea that the cosmos is shaped pretty much like Genesis 1 literally describes it.   Some Christians deny that the “Word of God” contains such an inaccurate description of reality, some make excuses for it like they described it that way but that’s not actually what they believed, and most people, Christian or otherwise, know that how they described it is how they thought it really was. For some this somehow turns into God describing things in a way they were comfortable with but for the rest of us it’s just clear evidence that the verses don’t originate with God but the people essentially making shit up to provide *an* explanation for what they didn’t know *the* explanation for.   Some of us include God as part of the made up explanation. Some say that God is real but the people were ignorant and they were like blind men describing an elephant. The latter extends to Baha’i where they claim that all of the older religions provide a partial explanation but only Baha’i can provide a complete explanation by combining Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Hindu, Zoroastrianism, and a whole bunch of other belief systems where Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Mohamed, and the Baha’u’llah were all messengers of the one true god.   The belief systems differ, according to Baha’i, because these people only received a piece of the big picture. The belief systems actually differ because they started with the idea that a mind can explain all of the mysteries behind physics and then they independently gave these gods different attributes and they independently decided what these gods want, how many gods exist, and what, if anything, happens after we die in the sense of an afterlife.  Creationists, especially YECs, worship the Bible like the Bible is itself God but most of them are appalled by the idea that their God could actually be wrong. Some go straight to atheism when you disprove the accuracy of the texts. Some go towards a more liberal interpretation and then deism before even thinking about the possibility of there being no god at all. I actually took the second path but I’ve never been a YEC and I’ve been an atheist for 20 years.']"

If your car breaks down or you get sick, it takes you days to get your hands on the money you've invested. When you look back over the course of an entire year of putting in $10/week, you see that your $520 in deposits is now worth a whopping $550 *if* you didn't make any bad guesses.   These sentiments are generally aimed at people in their late 20s/early 30s, so I got some numbers. In 2021, the median income for individual 25 year olds is $36000. It's $52,776 for 35 year olds.

The average American house will cost you almost [$360,000](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/102001/united-states/).   So here we have *median* earners (half of all earners make less) bringing in less than $1000/wk gross, or about $750 take home. Almost half of that goes straight to rent for a *median* apartment. If our median person in a median apartment wants to buy a median house, they'll need to save up $11000 for a down payment of 3%. At $200/month saved, it'll take almost 5 years to put that together, but home values are rising at 12% and so are rents, while incomes are only rising at 3-5% per year.   If our median earner lives in a cheaper apartment and buys a cheaper house, then lower earners will lose the opportunity to rent or buy those same properties.""]"
