Why are you saying it's impossible when we literally do it for K-12?   Yeah, and? Taxes pay for K-12 as well. Your point?   So that they can send their kids to college without having to pay for it independently out of pocket. Instead it gets paid for through taxes. I suggest taxes on the rich, that way even middle class families won't have to pay a dime for it.  You know, people in this country used to work and fight for the next generation to have it better than they did. Free higher education would make it better for the future than we have it right now. Why do you fight so vehemently against a good thing?"", 'Yeah I really don’t care if you’re condescending or sarcastic. I mostly found it amusing you’re telling me to do more research and that I’m not listening, when you don’t understand the legal system as well as you think you do.   Let’s try this one more time. The 6th circuit case you keep citing was regarding one specific rally, in which Trump never uttered any phrases which could be construed as encouraging violence. He also mentioned to his crowd to not hurt the protestors. These two factors led the appellate court to strike down the lawsuit.   January 6th and other rallies are entirely different because he *did* utter phrases which can be construed as inciting violence. His usage of the term “peaceful” could very well be mitigating, but that’s for a jury to decide. The 6th circuit case in no way is precedent that he can’t or won’t be charged, as you keep saying.   If you want case law that is directly relevant to Jan. 6th, try this on for size. A federal judge earlier this year rejected Trump’s efforts to dismiss a lawsuit, saying the court believes Trumps speech that day was not necessarily protected by the first amendment, because it incited violence.   https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-lawsuits-donald-trump-48fef5775a0043339fb38aa84ad419be  That ruling is currently being appealed to the DC circuit, but there’s a gem in there as well. The Trump lawyer recently told one of the appellate judges that civil suites should be barred because it sets a bad precedent for future presidents, but admitted that “Trump could theoretically face criminal liability over the riots.” Which is another good point: there are legal differences in civil cases, like the one you keep citing, and criminal ones. But his own lawyer admitted he could face criminal liability.   Trumps other statements that day behind closed doors are highly relevant. In order to prove incitement, prosecutors need to show intent. If you listen to Trumps statements throughout the day, it can be dismissed as Trump being Trump. On the other hand, his actions behind closed doors add context to his state of mind, and you’re flat out wrong if you think they’re not relevant to a charge of incitement or conspiracy.   I honestly couldn’t care less about the house impeachment managers editing a video. Impeachment is a political process, not a criminal one. And if that video was shown in criminal court, you don’t seem to understand how exculpatory evidence works anyways. The Brady rule only requires that the government hand over evidence that could show a defendants innocence, not that they themselves have to show it in court.  If Trump is ever indicted on incitement and/or conspiracy charges, prosecutors can use videos of his statements that day without mentioning his peaceful claim. Maybe they would to preempt the defenses argument, but prosecutors don’t play the role of defense attorneys…  I’m well aware that people are fanatical in their wish to see Trump go to prison. But it’s up to DOJ, not two people on Reddit who don’t have law degrees.', "" Please make your argument. How did the author define a healthy marriage. What characteristics? What are your reasons to believe that women seeking abortions and their sex partners share those characteristics?  I need a citation that in the referenced studies that the parents who were married wanted to be married to each other. It is your claim, so you can define what that means? Wanted to be married on the day they were married? 50 years of uninterrupted marital bliss? Whatever it is, please provide your citation that in the studies that demonstrated that children of married bioparents do better that the bioparents wanted to be married.    You mean all other things being equal. Actually, I am getting confused by your argument. Are you arguing that the children of a single woman who got married and got a marriage payment would not be better off if she got married and didn't get the marriage payment. Or are you arguing that the children of the woman would be better off if she got the payments even if she was married?   Sorry, typo. I meant to say: You seem to think single parents can't just go marry the other parent.    Because the data show this is less than ideal for the average child. If I am going to make these levels of changes to society, I really want to aim for the best possible situation.    I mean, how often do you think that happens? Laws don't exist to make sure that every possible thing in your life is already laid out for you, including everything that is highly unlikely to happen. People have to live their own lives. If some rare exceptional thing happens, you may be faced with rare exceptional choices. But for the hundreds of millions of other people, the law can provide some practical, broad support.    I don't want to incentivize gestation. I want all parties to get what they want. PL - no abortions. PC - more choices. Society - more and better citizens.  Society is not satisfied with women gestating and then abandoning children in garbage cans.    What are you talking about? Can you show me any US state marriage law that requires people certify they love each other? Are you serious with this?   Look, if you want to look for creative solutions, you cannot have such an inside the box attitude.    I think you will not get society on board. Paying women to give birth but having no expectations on what happens to the child after that. Perhaps all the claims of PCs about PLs not caring what happens to kids once they are born is just projection.    This is just discrimination. You can hire the best person for a job. The data show married bioparents are the best parents for kids.    Except marriage ties together two people's financial situations. The man is incentivized to marry the woman, as they now both have claims to the payments.    I already said either way. Are you in with no abortion restrictions? It seems like no.    Good thing this never happens, even if everyone is trying to get there.    The problem with this suggestion is why should I do it? Tell me why I should give money to a woman just because she gave birth. That seems like a horrible idea. Women would literally give birth, get the check, and throw the baby in the trash and get pregnant again. I am not paying for that.    Tell you what. If you want this, lets go to the mods and ask for a rule that anything that happens after birth is off limits on this sub. No more PCs saying that PLs don't care what happens after birth, because it is not about abortion and banned. Or is this a silly thing to say? I hope my point is getting clearer.""]"

I don\'t talk about everything there is to know about anarchist organization but I introduce the concept and that should be enough for you.     What exactly is this responding to?   You can\'t assert authority over me without the existence of other hierarchical practices or institutions. Authority requires a great deal of social and ideological support. In a society without it, and organized on anarchic lines, you are incapable of doing so. Not without drawing the ire of society itself.   Individuals or groups will respond to your actions however they want, taking into consideration the consequences their responses will have. There is no law or authority to dictate how people will respond or who can respond.  As such, their responses will have to take into account the context of your actions, why you took them, who is negatively effected, etc. In other words, there is no authority who issues a uniform command to everyone in regards to ""what to do with you"".     What does this mean and what is it responding to? Your refusal to quote what you\'re responding to makes your post incoherent to read.   They didn\'t use democracy. That\'s what made them non-democratic.   If by ""decisions"" you mean ""issue commands"", no. If by ""decisions"" you mean ""did anyone in the CNT-FAI take any actions?"", yes, But you don\'t need authority or democracy to take an action.   Societies are never ""run"" in the sense that there is one person at the top calling all the shots in any but the most totalitarian of societies. They are just the aggregate or sum of social interactions/activities within a given area.  As such, there isn\'t anything to really ""run"". Sure, the social interactions in the CNT-FAI are more ""complicated"" in the sense that, rather than dealing with individuals, you were dealing with groups. But the underlying principle was arguably much of the same.  That\'s my reason for pointing to interpersonal interactions. The underlying organization can be extended up to any scale. I also don\'t see how ""your friend wants to do something that doesn\'t effect or harm you in any way so you refrain from intervening"" doesn\'t exist at higher levels.   This is nonsense. First, authority is command. If there is no authority period then no one has to give a shit about your commands. If you\'d be like a crazy old man declaring himself the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. No one will buy it.     This is the same question I asked before and I already answered it.     Anarchists disagree with you and ""workers own the means of production"" does not entail democracy by definition.   As for how the economy will work, it will work based around free association. If you do not know what this means, I suggest you read my other comments on this post.   Since anarchist organization is associative, you\'ll probably be a part of a defense association which engages in mutual self-defense. In other words, others defend you in exchange for defending them. This is how external threats are dealt with.  And, if we\'re talking about violence internally within an anarchist society, the solution isn\'t to shoot people who use violence. It\'s to figure out why they\'re being violent, what conflict is at play, and how can we solve this conflict.     Through association.   Bookchin and Ocalan aren\'t anarchists by their own admission (Ocalan wrote an entire essay criticizing anarchism and Bookchin wrote two books arguing against anarchism before breaking away from the movement altogether).  Neither Kropotkin nor Bakunin supported democracy. In fact, they directly rebuke it in their works. Kropotkin wrote an entire book on the Paris Commune decryiing it for its using of democracy. Bakunin made it clear several times that he opposed democracy.  In regards to Makhno, I\'m less certain and his use of democracy was directly criticized by other anarchists at the time like Malatesta. It is clear that war creates conditions for authoritarianism. The CNT-FAI ended up integrating into the Republican government was coerced into passing laws or decrees until eventually disarming itself. This growing authoritarianism was opposed by anarchists within Spain (with many, like Durruti, creating alternative structures to the CNT-FAI leadership). It may be that Makhno was forced to make similar concessions.  Wikipedia is not a good source of information on anything pertaining to anarchism.', ' If you defend Communism, then take responsibility for the actions of your Kin. Otherwise, *don’t defend Communism*   This assumes I am a Capitalist (I am not), or that I would ever defend Nestle (Absolutely not), or that I associate with State Capitalism (again, no)   I don’t support Fox, CNN, MSNBC, etc  All are piece of shit News Media ran by pieces of shit. But it’s odd that you focus solely on Fox, and leave out CNN/MSNBC, who have also greatly contributed to mass shootings and the advancement of national divide.  Curious.   If you defend Communism, as you have, then you must either (A) admit Communism is terrible and you are playing Devils Advocate or (B) in some form support Communist Russia or Communist China  If (A), you have yet to make that clear, and yet by your statement show you are a Communist  If (B), you can not possibly argue *for Communism*, yet *against* Soviet Russia and Communist China.  Arguing *for them*, means defending a century of systematic oppression, censorship, genocide, and workers opression  Arguing *against them*, is illogical, as they *are Communism in action*.  It matters not what ‘Communism in-theory or Communism on-paper’ argue for, if every iteration leads to a despotic authoritarian genocidal regime.  So yes, you can support an ideology while being opposed to those who would taint it, yet when everyone who has had authority through said ideology ‘taints it’, that is no longer a coincidence, its a pattern.  When people say ‘ACAB’, and that the system of Capitalism is evil, and so any Police Officer who upholds said system is therefore evil by virture of opression, why do you not apply that to Communism?  Why do you insist that you must be treated differently?', 'You\'re skipping over a lot of facts.  \\- Hitler banned trade unions, and replaced them with a trade union. He replaced anyone who didn\'t agree with his vision, as I said before.  \\- He ostracized communist, like Lenin did, we went over this, there are different factions of Marxism, once you take power, they inevitably start fighting over ideological reasons. That doesn\'t make the Menschevik or Socialists any less communist, they are just a slightly different kind of Marxist.  \\- Yes, he became the head of the National Socialist Worker Party, basic history. He took the means of production and put it in the government\'s hand, he abolished the private banking industry, he socialized the ""weal"", basically everything you needed was government run with anyone attempting to do business needed to have a government political officer which is basically socialism in practice, it\'s what China does today.  \\- North Korea is democratic, they just have 1 party that always wins. That is socialism in practice. Soviets were just as \'democratic\', China is just as \'democratic\'. Democracy does not mean you get a choice, it just means you get to participate in the process. If you want a democracy with choice, you need a small-scale (as in city-state sized) Democratic Republic with a strong constitution that limits the government and privatize everything from the military to healthcare to food production. Basically, the promise of the US constitution on a scale of a village.']"

But even in its imperial stage it still held trappings of the Republic (a senate) despite it being far weakened. That is still a democratic construction, even if it was vestigial. Their lack of power made them less of a Republic than they used to be.   The Republic is not a dialog that describes how a Republic is put together. The dialog actually describes a continuum of governmental styles for City-States, categorizing them into 5 archetypes of which Greek Style Democracies or Republics were only one. The Kallipolis that you describe there as ""authoritarian aristocracy"" is held as a separate style of government from Democracy and the Greek Republics in general, as they were in the final stages of Democracy before the collapse into Tyranny in his construction.   Though, I have a lot of criticism about people using The Republic to draw any conclusions about society, because while it was influential, it was put together with thousands of years of less information than we currently have. The Archetypical forms of government Plato suggests would only function in a highly idealized and sanitized situation divorced from information or humanity, and the progression is not natural.   Any amount of democratic action that involves electing representatives, so long as the voting and representatives are real, makes it a Republic. Not all Democracies are equally democratic. You can have Republics where democracy and republicanism is extremely weak, but it is *still republican democracy* and it is the presence of that implementation of representative democracy that makes it a Republic.   That is a useless definition for the exact reasons I have already described. It relegates it to a label that only exists as a self identification with no practical real world meaning. It would be equivalent to me literally being a King because I ""claim authority based on my bloodline"" despite having no such authority.  This use of the word just turns it into a definitional free-for-all where literal fascists (The ones who push this definition the hardest by the way, as it is always them or their useful idiots who say ""Technically the US is not a democracy"" in an attempt to convince people that democracy is not all that great.) can use positive connotation words to distract from the reality that their goals are the destruction of Republicanism, even if they plan on doing it piecemeal.   Using the same construction I could claim that any Monarchy is actually a democracy if they claim to be, even though no one has the right to vote, because they claim to derive their power from the people, and therefore the people are technically voting just by existing. This kind of stuff is dumb.  The only way the words have any use is if they have actual, practical, real world applications. The US is a Republic because we are a *representative democracy.*', ' This is not a recruiting platform:  it\'s a discussion board by and for conservatives.  We have to ""present our case"" in real life and on ""neutral"" fora all the time, and we don\'t care to do it here. We know what we believe and why we believe it... we\'re not going to drop what we\'re doing and give a personally-customized poli-sci primer every time a liberal pops in ""seeking dialog""  (which almost always ends with them getting argumentative and then bamned for breaking our rules).  If we did that we\'d do little else.  There are scores of openly conservative websites and publications where you can learn what conservatives think.  Most of the posts in this sub are links to those sources, so when the five-hundredth liberal comes here and asks us to spool him up on why we think as we do - without having taken the time to read the sources that are in nearly every post  - it gets tedious.  So if you want to know what we think - *read what we read and then read what we write about it*.  That\'s what I mean about doing your own homework.   When you come here and ask us to explain something that has already been discussed here in great detail, it shows a lack of investment on your part to understanding us.  If you prefer the ""dialog"" method, then there are other subs for that.  I think they\'re largely a waste of time, because someone who\'s unwilling to peruse the existing materials is unlikely to be persuaded by spoon-feeding, but there are conservatives who are willing to try.   That\'s where you should go if you seek dialog.  As for what a leftist is:  there\'s a political spectrum (and it\'s not a horseshoe).  To the left is authoritarianism (communism, naziism, absolute monarchy), while to the right there is no government control at all.  The ultimate expression of that is total anarchy.  Neither extreme can last very long, so we always end up with something less extreme.  On the left we end up with ""soft"" control, which tends toward the fascism the Democrats seem intent on creating,  while on the right we have constitutional republics like the US used to be.  The problem is that the Overton window tends to shift to left over time, which is why today\'s Republicans would have been comfortable as Democrats from 30 years ago, and the Democrats have shifted so far to the left that the Communist Party of the USA no longer runs candidates for President to avoid siphoning votes from Democrats who believe as they do and can actually win.   As conservatives we wish to preserve the Rule of Law that established the US as a constitutional republic.  It\'s not that we\'re blind to the flaws of the system:  hard compromises had / have to be made, but we can address those without scrapping the entire system.']"

How?  Remember the FBI seized the laptop from the repair shop in 2019.  They knew it was genuine and not a ""Russian Influence Operation"".  The FBI has now had it for three years, and has done nothing but try to pretend there is nothing to see there.  When it was understood that there was child porn on the laptop, it was taken to the Delaware State Police - who passed it to the FBI.  The FBI Agent who filed the court case to seize it from the repair shop owner is the one who handles child porn investigations in that area.  They classified it, and went to considerable lengths to hide it and restrict access to it in their own record keeping system to prevent anyone from investigating it, and did their best to make it go away.  Then they sat on it for a year and did nothing.  When Giuliani was given a copy, the FBI was already spying on him, so it was aware of this.  That triggered their efforts to convince social, print, and broadcast media that it was ""Russian Disinformation"" in advance of it being publicly released.  ...and nothing will be done, because the FBI and DOJ are corrupt.   Money is the one thing the Bidens don\'t lack.  Aside from acting as bag man for $millions in bribes to his father, Hunter was being paid a $million per year by Burisma for a no-show job he wasn\'t qualified for and didn\'t speak the language of the country it was situated in.  His sole qualification was his political connection - and it turned out the money was well spent.  It was Hunter\'s job that Biden was protecting when he got the Ukrainian prosecutor fired on pain of not receiving $1 billion in US aid (never mind that the prosecutor was investigating the embezzlement of $2 billion in previous US aid by the company Hunter worked for).  Remember too that this is one of **three** laptops Hunter has lost.  The FBI recovered one of the others from his therapist, the third was taken by Russian drug dealers while Hunter was passed out.

(1/2)  “Oh how convenient... “all the comments were I was insulted were deleted"". Sure buddy. I checked your comment history and you were never insulted or belittled at all, and certainly NOT ""because"" you are a woman. That literally never happened.”  Yes, I’m sure some were. This post might have been made and worded to be directly about my experiences on reddit, but they’ve happened outside of it too.   “No one denies sexism against women exist. But if you want to make it a competition, the APA has quite clearly shown that women have an insanely bigger in-group preference than men (and by proxy, out-group bias *against* men). Men on the other hand, actually are more generous, kind &amp; forgiving towards WOMEN than they are towards their own gender. So while sexist men exist for sure, they are nowhere near close to the amount of sexist women out there.”  It wasn’t a competition. I was having a conversation with the other person. He kept insisting I lay down a source of evidence to what has been said to me/what I’ve seen, and I asked a simple question; if he’s ever seen it personally happen on here, which he admitted to seeing it occasionally.   “I visit this sub daily &amp; at the very least I read all the post titles... The vast, vast, VAST majority have nothing ""sexist"" about them.”  Yes, although it may not be in the titles it’s definitely in the comments. They’re displayed so vague sometimes.   I saw this comment the other day something along the lines of, “This woman is good, unlike the rest who are terrible.” I can only say that much because my memory of it isn’t that great. Basically a woman was siding with a man’s opinion, and he thought a good response to it was to praise her, then demonize all other women.  “Yes but if you\'re leaving for what you now acknowledge is a RARE occurance, then you were never serious about men\'s issues in the first place.”  My last comment goes with this.  Even if it is rare, it still happens and it makes my blood boil when I see it. And besides, how does its rarity define my sincerity towards men’s issues?  “You\'re 17, right? I honestly think you\'re just way too young to have a meaningful take on these sorts of topics. Not only are you in a very sensitive period in your life as a young woman, you frankly don\'t have the life experience. If a few ""mean internet words"" really bother you that much, that\'s fine. But then I advice you to delete all your social media in general.”  18* I see where you’re coming from. It’s difficult to take someone seriously when they’re probably in a completely different age group than you are, but it’s not just, “a few mean internet words,” it’s something that affects me and other women on the daily.   In a work environment, social setting, etc.   “How do they perceive me?” “Do they think I’m not capable?” “If I mess up they’ll think it’s because I’m a woman.”  It probably sounds like internalized sexism, but honestly it just feels like I’m taking on the thoughts of some men I’ve talked to.  I suffer with anxiety and seeing &amp; hearing these things often does take effect, and it’s reasonable to. It affects simple things like driving, because supposedly woman are terrible drivers. It affects the way I play video games. I waited until I was 18 to change my gamertag so people wouldn’t shit on me for being a woman when I die. Sounds dumb, but it’s genuinely a thing.  You probably don’t take it all too seriously because I’m young, but these problems are just as valid to me as they would be to someone in their mid 30’s.  “Lastly, at your age you shouldn\'t be lecturing men about the glorious history of feminism and ""what it truly meant"". You have absolutely no clue about its history at all, which would be fine if you weren\'t so hellbent on being right despite your ignorance. You can say that feminism was about ""equality"" all vou want, but there is no evidence to support that AT ALL. The Declaration of Sentiments 1848 was explicitly anti-male &amp; female supremacist in nature. This book is basically regarded as the feminist Bible. Even the suffragettes couldn\'t care less about real equality. They were extremely racist, classist and sexist towards men... just appreciate that they were fighting for their petty right to vote during the same time when MILLIONS of men were forcibly sent off to fight in wars they wanted nothing to do with to be blown to shreds. Where was the outcry from feminists? Where were the marches to include women in the draft? Ah right, never happened... and what actually happened is that feminists spearheaded the white feather campaign, which shamed men into enlisting by branding them as cowards if they failed to do so (which led to many men killing themselves from social ridiculue). And THIS is what you claim is a movement ""for equality"" and ""wasn\'t against men""? Fuck outta here.”   I hate to be this person, but I’m going to slim it down. Yes, I don’t have all the answers to the original concept of feminism. No one really does. But I can assure that when women wanted jobs, to go to school, to vote, it wasn’t their intention for those horrible things to happen to men.  If all that was normalized then, I think women would’ve been drafted. But it wasn’t normalized, hence why women had no part in it. Nowadays we see women participating in going to war because their opportunities have grown.  That is a, “history is history, now is now, we can’t change the past, but we can continue to shape the future.”  It’s not about equality at this point, it’s equity. Both genders have different needs that need be met in different ways.', 'I get the impression that you might think that trans people think they are perfectly mentally healthy. But everyone agrees that gender dysphoria is not a normal, desired state. It is an incredibly awful mental condition with only one known (and rather reliable) treatment, namely transition. Trans people *do* sew psychologists, and the psychologists all tell them to do the thing that you are saying they shouldn\'t do.  You also seem to think that a trans person is demanding that you deny the reality of their biological sex (similar to denying the reality of a historical fact, like who won a fantasy football game). This is also not so; if a trans man thought he was biologically male, he wouldn\'t have gender dysphoria. Rather, the average trans person simply wants to have their *gender* recognized. That\'s it. You calling a trans dude ""he"" doesn\'t deny reality.  Have you met a trans person who passes perfectly? I\'ve met multiple trans people, especially multiple trans men (but also at least one trans woman), who I didn\'t know were trans until they told me. At times, I was *shocked* to discover that a person was trans. Biologically, those trans men were female, yet it would have been ludicrous to refer to them as ""she"" - because pronouns don\'t have to follow biology.', ""Part 2:  &amp;#x200B;   1.) It's not just the aspects of gender than specifically treat men better than women that are the problem, but aspects of gender that are just differences, without one group being treated better. When you take that view, everyone is part of the problem. You call people by different words depending on if you view them as men or women, so you're part of the problem to. You probably also interact slightly differently with men and women in other ways. But it is empirically true that many people who use different pronouns for men and women are willing to use pronouns that align with someone's identity.  Importantly for trans people, it is very stigmatised for a woman to get a phalloplasty. But though surgeons commonly won't let women get phalloplasties, they generally will let trans men get them. That is a way that men and women are treated differently where making one's identity clear clearly can change how you are treated (i.e. if you are allowed to get the surgery that will make you feel comfortable with your body). So people who reinforce gender will sometimes listen, and how someone identifies can make an important difference to how they are treated (I have gone for the low-hanging fruit here, but this applies much more broadly).  2.) Regarding someone who identifies as a man as a man is enforcing gender. But so is regarding someone who identifies as a man as a woman. People are going to enforce gender just as much either way, so given that, they should be encouraged to at least enforce a different gender where that would greatly reduce misery. And that doesn't at all prevent also encouraging people to treat people the same regardless of gender. In fact, I think particularly with trans people that aren't close to passing, where it takes a conscious effort to get their gender right, this can make people see how pervasive and arbitrary gender norms are. This helps move in the direction of gender abolition. More broadly, if trans people were widely accepted, the patriarchal justifications for gender roles, which are usually based in biology, would completely fall apart.  &amp;#x200B;   In the same way, the goal is to twist women (my categorisation) into submission. Though this is probably where personifying the patriarchy is more confusing than helpful. There isn't some group of men planning how to oppress women, so there isn't a goal in the literal sense. The 'goal' is the social function it performs for the patriarchy. And the function it performs is to twist women, both trans and cis, to serve men.  It also twists trans men to serve men as women, to the extent that it gets them to perform the role of 'woman' before transitioning (and to the extent that those behavious may linger after transitioning). If anything, it twists trans women more than cis women, as trans women tend to be more harshly sanctioned for not performing femininity. I agree that gender abolition should be the ultimate goal. And I agree that we need to try to reduce how much people are treated differently according to gender here and now. But that doesn't mean we can't also let people move between those gender roles where it will make them less miserable. If you already treated men and women exactly the same, this would require absolutely nothing of you.  &amp;#x200B;   Human sex is bimodally distributed. There are not many people inbetween the two main clusters, but there are some. As such, it makes sense to take that bimodal distribution into accoutn when designing society. But if you design things in a way that excludes people in the middle, you are reinforcing that distinction.  If you have a dating app where people attracted to men select the male sex, the people selecting that will be people attracted to male sexual characteristics. As such, cis men that happen not to fit well with those characteristics (and there will always be some) will not have much success on such an app. As such, men on that app are incentivised to try to make themselves more typically male. E.g. by not shaving or by working out in ways that make their body type more typically male. As such, this app ends up encouraging men to fit themselves into a male ideal- which is recreating a rudimentary form of gender. The same applies to women of course.  &amp;#x200B;  But also, I worry that the conversation is drifting again. How people are treated in a gendered way is a very different question from how people *should* be treated in a gendered way. We both agree that in a first-best world no one would be treated in a gendered way at all. But in a second-best world where gender roles do exist, I would prefer trans people to be treated in line with the gender role they choose, whereas you would prefer them to be treated in line with the gender role they were assigned at birth. The former question is relevant to the latter, but they're obviously not the same.""]"

I still later addressed the hypothetical.  And an abortion also can be done when the fetus is dead.   You state it right here. These are still abortions. They are the names of specific procedures of abortions.   This isn't a point to address but as mentioned I'll address everything so I'll send my sympathies for whatever put you in the situation that you had to observe an abortion first hand.   As mentioned I broke it down into various scenarios as your hypothetical is fairly edge case but still answered the original hypothetical.   There's a difference between delivery and removing a fetus. Delivery is the birthing process which involves expelling out the vagina. I don't think it is a good idea to require that as sometimes it is a harmful thing to attempt. But you can certainly advocate for some stipulation of attempting to save any fetus that is aborted if it can survive. Which is a common medical practice and what I was referring to.   Yes doctors do attempt to save the now baby. If it has a great enough possibility to survive.   Not sure as I would need reference. Unviable fetuses can technically be considered babies as a fetus that is born is technically no longer a fetus. But not all fetuses are viable. It reaches fetus at the 10th or so week of development. Greater than 20 is when it first can have a reasonably measurable possibility to survive.  Prioritizing life for life's sake is not something we do. Unless you're a Jain or something equivalent.   Humans (we can operate from embryos are human) in the womb generally don't have many of those qualities depending on the stage of development. And there is no evidence that they have all of them until well after many of the proposed abortion cut offs. First trimester.  And location is relevant as you cannot shoot someone out in the street but you can when they are trespassing on your property. This is covered in stand your ground laws.  The last bit is unimportant as anyone who is discussing this (and is human) has been born. The unborn requesting you to have sex with your partner in 5 minutes so that can be conceived and subsequently born cannot have a say in our decisions.   Abortion as stated in 2 (but with less loaded language) does impact the carrier at the detriment to their health. As such they should be able to choose whether to accept an unforeseeable deterioration to their health that can be avoided or to follow through. There is more that can be brought up and discussed but I'll only go with this.  Most of those 97% are also not anywhere close to the ~20 week mark where a fetus could be viable as around 80% of abortions are done within the first trimester. With a majority of late stage abortions being emergencies.  There's a bit I didn't discuss like you mentioning it as trivial which is opinion. The population of pro choice people who slander pro life. Which is something that happens on both sides and not helpful to the discussion. There are historical implications with the pro life side but there is no reason to discuss it as whether it is true or not that won't change someone's mind. I am just trying to save a bit of room though.   Humanity is not important when discussing rights. Which has been stated and I've mentioned at least two hypotheticals illustrating how it is not because we are humans that it makes sense to have rights.  In this way it doesn't matter if other races are defined as human or not. Those rights are still applicable because the qualities they have. Not the membership.  Assigning rights based on membership to humanity is the issue.   An efficiently infinite amount of people are unborn. Every egg would have to be fertilized to have the least amount of unborn. This doesn't say anything though.  Our population is still rising dangerously even with abortions. Utilization in those communities are so widespread because of other factors like socioeconomic status. Getting rid of systematic racism would help even out those numbers. Making more people in those communities wouldn't necessarily help them. And it can't count as genocide as it doesn't have the goal of destroying those groups."", 'Like I said, abortion is not a right', ' So anti-choice people saying abortion is murder *doesn’t* stoke division?  “Reproductive rights” doesn’t only mean the ability to reproduce. It covers all aspects of a woman’s right to reproduction and bodily autonomy including the right to terminate a pregnancy. And yes of course adoption is another option, but the same people who are anti-choice hypocritically don’t want to adopt orphans themselves. If anti-choice people want every woman to give up their baby for adoption rather than get an abortion, then go ahead and adopt children yourselves.  Abortion also doesn’t just cover healthy pregnancies. Total abortion bans also prevent women from getting an abortion if they have an unviable pregnancy such as entopic pregnancies. It is literally impossible for a baby to carry to term in an entopic pregnancy, but because hospitals in states where there’s total abortion bans have to be careful about the legality of it they have to deny women with entopic pregnancies from getting an abortion. Which then leads to those women getting unnecessarily sick, bleed out profusely, and have to go through that traumatizing experience.  But it doesn’t matter what you and I believe around the morality of abortion. 7 SCOTUS judges codified Roe into law, including conservative ones,  not because of moral reasons. They did it because those 7 judges recognized it didn’t matter how much you try to ban abortion, women will attempt to induce abortions regardless. So all that abortion bans do is force women to seek illegal means of getting them which only further endangers their lives. And now abortion bans have even less authority because we now have drugs that women can take in the comfort of their own home to induce an abortion without having to go to a clinic/planned parenthood. Those drugs were literally created by combining currently existing over the counter medication, so even if abortion pills are banned women can simply buy the drugs used to create the abortion drug cocktail and still yield the same result.  Does that mean it shouldn’t matter if abortion bans exist cause women can get them anyway? No. Abortion bans are stupid because they needlessly attempt to put the government in control of a woman’s uterus when it is literally *impossible* to end the practice of abortion in the 1st place. Not to mention the fact 66% of Americans support abortions through the 1st trimester, and the overwhelming majority of abortions happen within the 1st trimester. Abortion rights are currently the most popular that they’ve ever been since Roe had been codified and support is only increasing as you go down into the younger generations. The anti-choice crowd is fighting a losing battle, in 10, 20+ years support for abortion’s going to be even bigger than it is now. Its a generational shift that you can’t change at this point.  If anti-choice people really cared about ending abortion they would wake up and acknowledge it is impossible to use the state to regulate women’s bodies. The only solution is to simply *reduce* them, which again bans don’t even have the ability to do that. What has been proven to reduce abortions is by increasing funding in comprehensive sex education, allow women free access to contraception, and funding for government resources to support women financially and emotionally who are considering having an abortion, etc. And guess what? The anti-choice people don’t support any of those 3 things. So until they get over themselves and accept that the practice of abortion will never end, women will continue having abortions despite all these bans and we will keep fighting to get rid of these bans.']"

It's a sovereign nation, a Democracy, and deserves self determination. If we let this happen to Ukraine it means no country is safe, especially those around Russia. We can't have a modern precedent that nations can just go in and take over other nations (especially those who aren't in NATO) or the world will devolve into the brutal imperialism that marred the past couple thousand years and has claimed hundreds of millions of lives.  2. Russia is genociding Ukrainians, torturing them, raping kids, kidnapping kids for God knows what - we can't in good conscience allow such brutality. To stand by and do nothing is to tacitly condone brutal genocide. Helping Ukraine is the morally right thing to do.    3. Ukraine has historic ties with European and NATO counties in the region and is a potential strong ally as well as has close cultural ties to many US allies, and allies stick together. Ukraine has been working towards joining the European Union and while it wasn't really a contender for NATO membership (because of occupied Crimea among other reasons) it was becoming a strong ally to European nations which are our allies, and allies work together. Helping Ukraine helps keep our allies safe and keeping our allies safe keeps us from having to go to war and send American soldiers to defend our military allies.   4. Ukraine is very resource rich and is called the Bread Basket of Europe. Protecting those resources is important to the global supply chain. People are literally going to starve to death especially in Africa because of the disruption in Ukraine's wheat supplies.  5. Ukraine has huge reserves of natural gas and oil. Ukraine could help reduce global reliance on countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia and is conveniently located to supply those resources to Europe.  6. Ukraine is the largest country in Europe (discounting Russia, which is largely in Asia anyway) and has a vital strategic location between European Democracies, fascist Russia, and developing nations like Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Iraq (and the Middle East in general) as well as strategically important coastline on the Black Sea. While Ukraine isn't eligible for NATO membership it's still an important buffer between NATO and Russia that made direct conflicts (and therefore WWIII) less likely.   7. Russia is anti-West, anti-America, anti-Democracy, and anti-non-Russians and we have to take a stand against their imperialist machinations or the entire region is in danger and Russia gets a toehold further into the heart of Europe, putting our allies in danger. We would also lose our buffer zone.   8. Ukraine has exposed Russia's army - which used to be considered the second best in the world - as a paper tiger. For a little bit of money (relative to the US budget) and some junky old equipment Ukraine is demolishing one of our greatest enemy's armies without the loss of a single American soldier. Militarily speaking it's the bargain of the century.  9. It's no secret Putin wants to recreate the old borders of the Russian Empire/Soviet Union and stopping them in Ukraine prevents the conflict from spilling out all over the region. If Russia captures Ukraine nobody knows where Putin would stop in his conquests. Ukraine is really taking a bullet for the entire region.   10. It's the right thing to do. And hopefully that still counts for something in people's minds."", 'Ukraine is not part of NATO.']"
9	2313	9_speech_gun_rights_guns	['speech', 'gun', 'rights', 'guns', 'amendment', 'militia', 'constitution', 'freedom', 'free', 'arms']	['So, not a free speech issue then.', 'The right to free speech?  /s', 'The collective rights claim started in the 1870s, by judges who wanted to deny people of their rights. It was strongly taken up by progressives, as a way to deny people of rights they did not want them to exercise. It was also rejected by Miller, Heller, McDonald, Bruen, and Caetano.   The founding fathers never talk about collective rights. It’s not mentioned in our founding documents. What they did talk about, repeatedly, and what is recognized in our founding documents, are individual rights. Our country is founded on the concept of individual rights.   Even with the argument that 2A only applied to militia service, you’re talking about an individual right, because militia members are expected to supply their own arms; thus they must individually have the right to possess arms. Furthermore, 2A protects a right to keep, meaning own, arms. It doesn’t protect a right to bear community held arms in militia service. Personal ownership is an individual right.   Those who hold a collective rights position on 2A are those who want to deny rights. The writings of the founding fathers and the ratifying debates are very clear that it is an individual right that all Americans have.  As far as 2A being a right that is intended to allow the people to resist tyranny: it was mentioned in the oral arguments for Bruen. It was also noted, in the McDonald case, that 2A was enumerated to allow the people to resist a tyrannical government.   The Heller ruling specifically notes that 2A was enumerated because the founding fathers feared the government would disarm the people, and this would allow a standing army to rule. In other words, it was enumerated to allow the people to resist tyranny. Heller further notes that, although this purpose is written in the prefatory clause as a reason for the right, it is not the only purpose for the right. Notice, it did not say that this was not a purpose for the right; just that it was not the *only* purpose for it.  What did the heller ruling say?  1. 2A protects an individual right, not a collective right  2. 2A did not just protect those arms useful for a militia, but all arms commonly used at the time; meaning it doesn’t just protect the keeping of arms in use at the time of ratification. It does not state that it only protects those arms used for self defense; although, in truth, all arms can be used for self defense. 3. The constitutional standard of review for 2A is one of text informed by the history and tradition of gun laws at the time of ratification.   What did the Bruen ruling say?  1. There is a right to bear arms outside of the home.   2. States could not have arbitrary conditions for carry permits; that prohibit average Americans, who are not prohibited people, from exercising their right to bear arms.   3. Self defense is a constitutionally valid reason to be armed.   4. It reaffirmed the standard of review for gun regulation, that was established by heller. In order to show a modern gun law is constitutional, it is the burden of the government to show a corresponding law from the time of ratification. Laws from the time of reconstruction can be used, although they will carry less weight, as long as they do not contradict the tradition of the time of ratification. It did not establish that the only purpose for 2A is self defense.  You don’t have to wait to see if this standard of review applies to 2A, as a whole, or just CCW. Besides the fact that the language of both Heller and Bruen plainly stated that all gun regulations have to pass this standard of review, the Supreme Court took up a few AW bans and mag bans, after the Bruen ruling was released. They struck the lower courts’ rulings in favor of these laws, and sent the cases back to the lower courts with insurrections to make new rulings **based off of the standards set by the Bruen ruling**.  So, it’s very obvious that the standard applies to 2A, as a whole.   A militia is a military force drawn from the civilian population *to supplement the army during an emergency*. Throughout all of history, militiamen have been required to furnish their own arms and equipment. You can go back to Anglo Saxon England and see that Fyrd( militia) members were expected to have their own arms. The king did not supply their arms.  NG members do not supply their own arms. The government arms and equips them. Yes, they have limited times of service, like a part time military, but their required NG time is not limited to training. They also do not supplement the other military branches, as additional forces to aid the primary military. They are put to use, instead of other branches, the same way each other branch gets applied to its own tasks. I imagine you are familiar with the army reserve. They serve one weekend a month and a two week summer camp. Very similar to the NG, really; except they don’t get called into service unless the regular army needs more soldiers. In spite of this similarity, the army reserve isn’t considered a militia. It’s part of the army: meaning it’s standing army. The NG is considered another branch of the military.   “The NG is a state based military force that becomes part of the reserve components of the US Army and US Air Force when activated for federal missions. It is a military reserve force composed of NG *military* members or units of each state...”  https://constitutionalmilitia.org/national-guard-not-a-militia/  DeSantis planned to revive Florida’s state militia, although there is a Florida NG, and this is because the NG is not a state militia.   Your anecdote about Washington is being misapplied. Originally, the founding fathers had not wanted to give the federal government the power to even have a military. They wanted to solely use state militias for national defense, because standing armies get used against the people. They changed their minds about this, because they realized militias, alone, could not properly defend the country. So, they gave the government the power to have a standing army, and felt that the fact that all of the people would be armed would prevent that military from being used successfully against the people. It was always intended that all the people be armed in similar manner to the military, and history will show you that this was the state of things, until the 20th century. Therefore, by the Bruen standard of review, the unorganized militia ( meaning all of the people) definitely have a claim to all the weapons of a soldier.  “Congress have no power to disarm the militia. **Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American**.... [T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.”  -Tenche Cox    The number of civilian ( unorganized ) militias, in the US, has exploded over the last few years, so I think reality disagrees with you.   You don’t sound too skeptical of government to me. In fact, you seem to think our rights come from the constitution and the government, and that government has the just power to decide what our rights are and what their powers are. Our rights do not come from the government. They do not come from the constitution. They come ‘from our creator’. They are natural rights. The constitution protects them. Government is not the supreme law of the land. The constitution is. Any law that contradicts the constitution is not valid- Alexander Hamilton.   If you let the government determine your rights, you will end up with no rights, and if you let the government determine its own limitations, it will have no limitations.  You should check out the Tenth Amendment Center. You’d be better informed of your rights and the constitution.  https://youtube.com/@TenthAmendmentCenter']

I\'d probably make a long list of other piecemeal changes too, but those two items are the real core. The goal would be to disincentivize ""cadillac"" plans by making people stop accepting these benefit plans as essentially ""tax free income"". (c) would effectively place employed people on similar footing with others buying healthcare plans on the market. So you\'d see large portions of people with ""good"" jobs (i.e. stable, full-time jobs with good pay) get ""worse"" plans and instead opt for more income, possibly saving it to try to beat the odds in the case where they stay healthy and don\'t need healthcare.  I think this would set up good incentives. For one, it\'s financially rewarding people for using the system less, so it would strongly discourage frivolous or unnecessary use. It also might incentivize people to stay healthier through lifestyle choices, because that is one of the best ways to avoid needing to use the healthcare system. It also would make people more cost-conscious at the provider, which would cause them to put pressure on providers to be more transparent about costs, avoid excessive costs, etc.  I think under such a scenario, a lot of problems would fix themselves.  One of the reasons I am open to universal healthcare is that I know that neither (a) nor (b) would be a political viability. My highest priority is to separate healthcare from employment and I see universal healthcare as the ""lesser of two evils"" relative to the status quo in which healthcare is associated with employment, to the tune of massive economic dysfunction, high cost of employment, arbitrary and non-market-based cutoffs between part-time and full-time work.  Do I think universal healthcare might be a lot worse than my idealized system? Yes. Possibly by a lot. But what good is a system that never gets implemented? I also think though that there could be compromises though that would achieve the best of both worlds. For example, Germany has a hybrid model where there is a certain, pretty adequate base level of universal health coverage, but then people can buy extra coverage if they want. I like the idea of that. It seems as close to a good model as I can come up with, and knowing a lot of Germans, they seem happy with their system, unlike the UK and Canada where people voice more frustrations even if there are a lot of things they like about it.', 'Lots of European countries have private healthcare and private health insurance.', 'Insurance based healthcare is 4 times more expensive than universal healthcare to run.']"

Those are popular votes and they don't exactly have a much higher voter turn out. A lot of people just don't vote regardless of electoral college or not."", 'So I guess you\'re abandoning your original argument then? You claimed the popular vote would be bad because candidates would focus on the few states that would control the outcome. But as I explained: 1) there\'s no reason to think this would be true with a popular vote; and 2) it\'s actually *already* true with the Electoral College. So, u/-HypocrisyFighter-, do you see your own hypocrisy on this? If you actually believe what you\'re saying, then you shouldn\'t support the Electoral College.   As for this new argument, it\'s basically circular. We\'re a constitutional republic, and a constitutional republic needs to have this convoluted electoral college system, so therefore we need the electoral college. Right? But in addition to being a circular argument, that\'s not even true about constitutional republics. A republic is essentially just a kind of representative democracy. So a ""constitutional republic"" is just a representative democracy that\'s bound by a constitution. So why exactly couldn\'t we have a representative democracy where everyone gets an equal vote for president? What is inconsistent about that? It\'s actually pretty simple. France, for example, is a constitutional republic with a president who is elected in a popular vote.   And again, it\'s worth remembering the original purpose of the Electoral College. It has nothing to do with any of the arguments you\'ve made here. The point was that the Founders didn\'t trust people to vote for president. They thought people would be too dumb and ill-informed. So instead, each state would send a few local political elites to join this temporary political body that would then choose the president. Of course, we\'ve essentially abandoned that system -- and for good reason! Each state lets people vote for president, and it\'s mostly irrelevant that they\'re technically just voting for a slate of electors that then picks the president. The electors don\'t really get to exercise any independent judgment. But then that eliminates the entire original purpose of the Electoral College. We end up with this system that usually (but not always) reflects the will of the voters.   Since we don\'t even have the system the Founders originally intended, why not just replace the Electoral College with an actual popular vote? That way the candidate with fewer votes doesn\'t weirdly become president some of the time.', ""You haven't made a single coherent point in this whole thread. You've just been smug and insulted me.  My argument is: Every American should have an equal voice in picking their president. Your argument is -- what exactly?  You started this thread by saying that if we had a popular vote system, politicians would never leave coastal areas and major metro areas would decide the election.  So first, this is false. We know this is false because candidates in state elections campaign for votes wherever they can get them, not just in the biggest metro areas. Your responses to this totally miss my point. I'm not talking about whether these people are neighbors or whether the states control their own elections. I'm saying as a practical political reality, when a candidate has to win a popular vote in a large area, they campaign wherever they can get votes -- not just the biggest population center. So if we switched to a popular vote, there's no reason to think candidates would ignore the millions of votes they could get all over the country that aren't just the biggest metros. And we also know it's false because the biggest metro areas aren't big enough to control the election. NY and CA already give 100% of their electoral votes to Democrats (erasing millions of R votes), and that's still not enough to necessarily decide an election.  Second, your complaint that, in a popular vote system, candidates would focus on only a few areas that control the outcome is already true of the Electoral College! Candidates focus only on swing states, which control the outcome. So if you actually think that's a problem, why don't you think that's a problem with the Electoral College?  And it's worth noting that none of your arguments have anything to do with the original purpose of the Electoral College, which was to ensure political elites would choose the president, instead of the unwashed masses. See [Federalist No. 68](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp).  I like to have good faith discussions with people.

I don't actually know whether inflation or deflation would be better for poor renters if these were ht only two factors on the scales; in reality I think deflation just tanks the entire economy fast enough to overwhelm those effects either way.  As far as the middle class with a small amount of discretionary wealth goes, it's basically the same as the wealthy. The smart ones will either buy assets (mostly homes or index funds) and have them appreciate under inflation, or sit on savings under deflation.  And the dumb ones will do the opposite of that and suffer, under either situation.    At least under inflation, it is smart to buy a house and other appreciating assets, so you get to enjoy having them while they appreciate instead of not having them while the money sits in a bank account.  I think that basic difference, getting to buy things that you enjoy the use of while they appreciate, makes inflation better for the middle class with a little bit of discretionary wealth."", ' Because it would have made inflation even worse than it is.']"

I honestly can't fathom how far one has to insert their head into their rectal orifice to think this is an intelligent or compelling argument.   We as Americans have the right to walk our streets without fear of assault from violent criminals. Where those violent criminals choose to break that social contract, we have the right to dispatch the threat with force, up to and including lethal force. Kyle Rittenhouse was walking the street attempting to put out a vehicle fire when he became the victim of a violent, unprovoked attack by Joseph Rosenbaum. There is no reason Rittenhouse should have or could have known that that simple action would subject him to a violent, unlawful assault.   Joseph Rosenbaum knew or should have known that his violent, unprovoked assault on an openly armed person would lead to serious injury or death for himself. That knowledge did not dissuade him, and he paid for his stupidity with his life.   Maybe we should blame *him*, not the kid who he attacked.    What I don't understand is how your side is shamelessly inconsistent and hypocritical in your arguments.   You blame Rittenhouse for the events of that night simply because he was there trying to protect his community from bad faith actors who were trying to destroy it, yet the violent career criminal who attacked Rittenhouse is spared from fault. In some circles, Rosenbaum is considered a hero. You denigrate Rittenhouse by pointing out that he traveled from outside of the area to be there and did so while armed, yet you hail Gaige Grosskreutz when he traveled further than Rittenhouse did, with no ties to the community, and unlike Rittenhouse he did so while *illegally* armed because his concealed weapons permit had been revoked after his felony conviction.   Frankly, I'd have a lot more respect for you guys if you dropped these nonsensical arguments and just admitted that you wanted to fry Rittenhouse because you hated what he stood for and killed people you consider allies with a weapon you despise.

Because like I said in my post, race is so nuanced and a broad grouping of people as opposed to ethnicity which is more narrow and specific. The best example being \'black\', because this \'race\' didnt even exist &lt;100 years ago and the people we now consider to be black were either then called Hamites (which were considered then to be a subgroup of caucasians) or (for lack of a better word) ""negroes"". And regardless there is no \'black\' cultural history today, only ethnic ones, ie African-Americans, Nigerians, Caribbean, Ethiopian..    My understanding is that races like \'black\' or \'white\' are just a labels applied to someone who meets a certain phenotype (with political roots as well, explains why Italians immigrants weren\'t initially considered white when they first landed in the U.S.), because theres no genetic or cultural trait that all \'black\' people share with one another.  While I think your argument certainly applies to ethnicity I don\'t see it applying to race because there\'s no \'black\' culture, \'black\' heritage or \'black\' dna like i said but only ethnic ones. Because of my perspective on this, I fail to see what an individual like [martina big](https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/29261384_2064959633781163_5735926568950169600_n.jpg) (left) would be appropriating for identifying as black, shes a german woman identifying herself as black but not appropriating a specific ethnic group or culture, she like I\'m discussing is transracial in the sense of the broad group, since theres no \'black dna\' what objection is there?

I haven\'t wanted to sprung for one when the ammo is so hit and miss in my region. I have always wanted one however it would be just for the range I think. 9mm is ideal imo, given the current world caliber market/foundation.  I can get 9mm for under 15 a box, yet 5.7 is usually ridiculously expensive and there often just isn\'t much of it. Twice in the last 2 years though I have seen a plethora of it at each instance at my lgs, that doesn\'t even sell a 5.7 firearm.  I think it\'s cause I gained some weight(not fat just adult body, not super lean) and I honestly don\'t feel a difference between 9mm and 45acp. It took my by surprise and I had to fire a lot of each trying to figure it out. The only reason I could conclude was that I was 200 lbs now and not 150 and super athletic. I\'m bulkier now and I think it absorbs the recoil or something.  One thing I like is that shooting seems like a universal love language that transcends cultural differences. I can shoot with anyone from any other country in the world, and we will have fun together. Even if we speak different languages. I also like to learn from shooters from other countries. My step grandfather was Japanese and his wife was chinese. No shortage of firearm love there either, while my father and our side is very European, Swedish, Norwegian, Irish, Scottish. Yet I have hung out with other folks being older Germans, Dutch, Russian, Ukrainian, to give a few examples and it was just a fun time. It\'s like guns and food are bridges to peace, ironically. Preference for them seems to be based on what is most commonly available to them throughout their life. Usually calibers I\'m not used to. The .38 seemed common pistol ammo for some of the Asian Americans which I thought was strange, as I was raised being told a 38 is the ""poor man\'s machete"". My father prefers larger caliber pistols and is quite a great shot with them. We don\'t get along but we could spend an entire day at the range together without a problem. It\'s bizarre to think about.  Sorry for the tangent, but your comment made me think of some things I haven\'t thought of for a while.', 'I should have elaborated further in my initial comment.   When you train to utilize a firearm for defensive uses you should always be training with your primary firearm as characteristics change from gun to gun. Let’s do a comparison to really nail down those differences. I have a tx22 which is a little plinking pistol chambered in 22lr. It’s an easy pistol to shoot with almost no felt recoil. I conceal carry a p365xl in 9mm. It’s a great gun which while easy to shoot has significantly more felt recoil and a different size, grip, and set of sights. When shooting both of these pistols I will conduct myself differently in regard to point of aim, expected impact point, grip, and shooting stance. With the tx22 I can reasonably shoot with almost any grip even utilizing poor stance and technique while expecting decent results. The same can not be said for the 9mm.   If you utilized the 22 only for training this would lead to poor habits in technique that are masked by the low recoil and ease of use. Then when you transition to a firearm that you do not shoot often because of your training crutch you are going to experience far more misses and potential issues like losing control of your firearm. I have seen folks transition to larger calibers that expect the same results and let the recoil wildly throw the firearm around. If you do that in a defensive situation where you are going to fire multiple shots in succession you are going to let rounds fly that you have no idea where they are going to impact. These rounds may end up in your neighbors or loved ones. If you aren’t using 22 defensively then you should leave firearms like that to plinking or casual shooting only.  The correct procedure for the OP should be to visit a gun range with an instructor and rent several firearms to determine which size, weight, and configuration they are comfortable with then take some classes to develop the correct technique and increase confidence behind the trigger. Then to continue to drill and train on their own while periodically taking further education on practical shooting. Ideally taking part in events such as IDPA or USPSA so they can understand dynamic shooting as opposed to static shooting in a controlled environment. Having a firearm should not be a light decision where you buy a plinking pistol and shoot it once in a while and consider yourself proficient enough for a defensive situation where you have shot your primary firearm little to none. We have a responsibility to those around us as well as our loved ones so we shouldn’t allow poor training or concepts to potentially make the situation worse.']"

So why is it suddenly such a stretch to say that it's entirely possible for a young person to be manipulated by much older partner with more life experience and economic capital?  There's nothing inherently wrong with age gap relationships, but I would say the nature of the relationship is dependent on someone's motives. Does the older have a pattern of sexually pursuing very young adults? If so, why? Would they go younger if it were legal?"", ""  Okay let me dissect,   This is literally contradicting yourself. You say there's nothing wrong inherently but people inherently having concerns about relationships they know nothing about and judging people they know nothing about is okay. Because those concerns are valid. If you claim those concerns are valid then you are claiming that on average there's something wrong with the age gap inherently.   So sure you can say there's nothing wrong with it inherently but that doesn't match and contradicts with you saying that age gaps are a valid concern, and it's okay for people to judge strangers they don't know....   So what? This is true for any and every relationship, do you (or said women) question every relationship? If not then why specifically those with an age gap? If there isn't anything inherently wrong why treat those relationships different from any other? Why do people think they should even meddle in situations they know nothing about?   It doesn't matter if we just consider people to be individuals that are simply looking for a match with another individual.  The last question is a loaded question were you are trying to imply these people are akin or close to pedophiles. Ps adulthood is 18 in most of Europe, would most go below 19 or 20, nope not from what I've seen in the EU, so honestly this is a very random concern and shows bias and prejudice.   Really XD how the hell can you claim there isn't anything inherently wrong with age gaps in relationships while at the same time literally saying here, that on average there's something wrong with them, hell you are even claiming there's something wrong with a vast majority as only some exceptionz aren't.  Seriously the mental gymnastics you must have gone trough and your complete inconsistency, to even still say there isn't anything inherently wrong, while showing such obvious bias ...     Wait so a 30 year old complains about women in their 22nds and 23rds, and their excuse about being completely judgemental about strangers they know nothing about, is that an older men is going to take advantage of their like 12 year old daughter. If that happens then honestly I think the problem is their parenting not their daughter at 22 or 23 choosing to date a rich 30 year old, funnily enough I don't hear most 40 year old women (when it could actually happen) complain about 30 year old men dating women in their early 20ies. Any adult trying to date a 12 year old is simply a pedophile, that's in no way the same as someone who's 30, dating another adult who's 22 or 23.   Again those thoughts are very biased, extremely judgemental and generalising, especially since you nor those women know anything about these men nor the women they date. Because you judge them from your high chair, acting all entitled/narcissistic, thinking you know better, without first trying to simply talk to them before judging.  ###**Let me repeat this again** "", ""Most men find younger women attractive, there is nothing wrong about it. And it's not wrong to pursue them unless they are under the age of consent.  I do agree with the point that you made in other comments that large age gaps are often not healthy in relationships. Smaller ones like 5 years are pretty normal though. My parents have a 15 year age gap and they are still together, so it's not like it can't work though it definitely isn't something to recommend.""]"

But sure we can cover it all.  From the Canadian Paediatrics Society’s review of the medical literature:  [“It has been estimated that 111 to 125 normal infant boys (for whom the risk of UTI is 1% to 2%) would need to be circumcised at birth to prevent one UTI.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) And UTIs can easily be treated with antibiotics.  [""The foreskin can become inflamed or infected (posthitis), often in association with the glans (balanoposthitis) in 1% to 4% of uncircumcised boys.""](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) This is not common and can easily be treated with an antifungal cream if it happens.  [“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) And condoms must be used regardless.  [""Decreased acquisition of HSV   NNT = 16""](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) Comparatively better than hiv, but the repercussions are still not in line with removal of body parts, either preventively or once infected.  HPV has a vaccine.  Last note regarding all STIs: STIs are not even relevant to newborns or children. So the informed decision can go to the informed patient themself later in life.   [“Decreased penile cancer risk: [Number needed to circumcise] = 900 – 322,000”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision).  [""An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction. This therapy ... allow[s] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision.""](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision)  These stats are terrible, it\'s disingenuous for these to be called legitimate health benefits. And more importantly, all of these items have a different treatment or prevention method that is both more effective and less invasive.    The standard to intervene on someone else\'s body is medical necessity. The Canadian Paediatrics Society puts it well:  [“Neonatal circumcision is a contentious issue in Canada. The procedure often raises ethical and legal considerations, in part because it has lifelong consequences and is performed on a child who cannot give consent. Infants need a substitute decision maker – usually their parents – to act in their best interests. Yet the authority of substitute decision makers is not absolute. In most jurisdictions, **authority is limited only to interventions deemed to be medically necessary.** In cases in which medical necessity is not established or a proposed treatment is based on personal preference, interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices. With newborn circumcision, medical necessity has not been clearly established.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision)  To override someone\'s body autonomy rights the standard is medical necessity. Without necessity the decision goes to the patient themself, later in life. Circumcision is very far from being medically necessary.   See the medical ethics above. There doesn\'t need to be a reason ""not to cut"". Those that want to circumcise others have to prove *medical necessity*. That\'s the direction this goes, and what the burden of proof is.     Arguably the complication rate is literally 100%, since [the foreskin which is the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847)) And since circumcision is not medically necessary.  Only by ignoring the removal of the foreskin can a lower complication rate be claimed. Or complications be limited only to surgical complications.   Ethicist Earp discusses the claim that it’s easier at birth: [“This claim is based on retrospective comparisons on non-concurrent studies using dissimilar populations, dissimilar methods and criteria for identifying complications, and they fail to adequately control for the method used, the device, the skill of the practitioner, the environment, and so on. So this claim which is oft repeated why it must be done early, because you’re running out of other reasons, is based on a very poor data analysis.”](https://youtu.be/SB-2aQoTQeA?t=32m21s)  This also portrays it as an either-then-or-now scenario, which is a false dichotomy. It doesn\'t need to happen at all.   Only by ignoring the removal of the foreskin can a lower complication rate be claimed. Or complications be limited only to surgical complications.  Ethicist Brian Earp discusses this idea: [“if you assign any value whatsoever to the [foreskin] itself, then its sheer loss should be counted as a harm or a cost to the surgery. ... [Only] if you implicitly assign it a value of zero then it’s seen as having no cost by removing it, except for additional surgical complications.”](https://youtu.be/SB-2aQoTQeA?t=2m32s   Continuing from above:   “Fine-touch pressure thresholds in the adult penis”  Which finds that [the foreskin **itself** is the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847))   That study’s conclusion: [""The transitional region from the external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis. Circumcision ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis.""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847)   You can make that argument, and as such you are free to decide for your own body. The standard to intervene on someone else\'s body is medical necessity. Without medical necessity, the individual themself can look at the information themself and make their own informed decision, later in life.

Supply is low, demand is high.  Even state schools have like a 50% rejection rate.  So…tuition can be sky high and people still buy it.

This is all possible because the student loans are guaranteed.  The school will get their money so they don’t need to make tuition affordable and make sure students can afford it.  On one hand this lets poor kids get an education, on the other hand it drives up the cost of tuition because everyone can afford college.', 'This is 6 years old, but it shows how much states have cut funding for higher education. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fancy-dorms-arent-the-main-reason-tuition-is-skyrocketing/  Edit  In 2000, Temple University was primarily a commuter school. On-campus dorms could house fewer than 4,000 students out of a total student body of more than 30,000. Most facilities were badly outdated, and the average student paid $12,800 a year (in 2016 dollars) in tuition to attend.  Today, Temple, where I work, looks very different. Beautiful new buildings are the norm rather than the exception. A recently built 24-story dorm and adjoining dining center highlights the university’s transition to a residential campus. Each of the dorm’s apartment-style suites comes equipped with a flat-screen TV and other amenities. The number of administrators in management and executive positions has grown by 40 percent to over 900. Oh, and tuition now runs $19,000 for the typical student after accounting for scholarships and other aid.  It’s tempting to blame Temple’s shiny buildings and new administrators for the big increase in tuition. But there’s another, much more important reason for the rising costs: Over the same period, Pennsylvania’s state government cut its per-student appropriations by $6,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars.  The rapid increase in the cost of college in recent decades — and the associated explosion in student debt, which now totals nearly $1.3 trillion nationally — is all too familiar to many Americans. But few understand what has caused the tuition boom, particularly at the public institutions that enroll roughly two-thirds of all students at four-year colleges. Many commenters,\xa0particularly\xa0in the\xa0popular press, focus on ballooning administrative budgets and extravagant student amenities. Those elements have played a role, to be sure, but by far the single biggest driver of rising tuitions for public colleges has been declining state funding for higher education.  It is true that today’s students enjoy better amenities — usually in the form of nicer gyms, dorms and dining halls, though some campuses feature\xa0lazy rivers and climbing walls\xa0— than I or, especially, my parents did during our time in college. It is also true that today’s universities employ far more administrators and staff who don’t have any direct role in either research or instruction. When my father attended the University of Florida1\xa0in the 1970s, professors were required to also serve as academic advisors and meet individually with students to plan their schedules. Today, schools retain many staffers whose role is to assist both faculty and students. Some of those jobs are easy to mock: One\xa0frustrated grad student\xa0built a\xa0job-title generator\xa0that spits out bloated titles such as vice executive for the committee on dining relations.  Recent Stories from FiveThirtyEight  ￼Top Storiesby\xa0FiveThirtyEight00:3701:12￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼33 Cool Charts We MadeIn 2022  And it is also true that professors (at least those on the tenure track) are paid better than the people who held those same jobs years ago. Average salaries for full professors (the highest rank) at\xa0top public institutions exceed\xa0$160,000 annually. Salaries for full professors have risen 12 percent in excess of inflation since 2000.  All of those trends add to the cost of college, but not by that much. At most, about a quarter of the increase in college tuition since 2000 can be attributed to rising faculty salaries, improved amenities and administrative bloat. By comparison, the decline in state support accounts for about three-quarters of the rising cost of college.  Consider Pennsylvania’s four public research institutions,2\xa0one of which is Temple.3\xa0Average tuition revenue per student (adjusted for inflation) increased by $5,880 between the 2000-01 and 2013-14 academic years (the most recent available data). State appropriations per student have declined nearly $4,000 over the same period, from about $7,750 to $3,900. Put another way, if Pennsylvania restored funding for higher education to its 2000 levels, Pennsylvania’s public research institutions could reduce tuition by nearly $4,000 per year without altering their budgets. For students, the impact could be even greater once loan fees and interest were taken into account.  By contrast, imagine that each of these institutions cut per-student spending for student services, administration and instruction back to 2000 levels, then passed those savings on to students in the form of lower tuition. How much would students save? Reducing student services would save each student $380 per year. Dropping all those new administrators would save $150 per student per year. And rolling back spending on faculty salaries would save $850 per year for the average student. Together, those three categories have added $1,380 to the cost of attendance since 2000, about a quarter of the total increase. At least some of that spending benefits students directly: Student-service spending has been found to increase the\xa0likelihood of graduating, and increased spending on instruction leads to\xa0higher earnings\xa0later in life.  National trends for all public four-year schools mirror those from the research institutions of Pennsylvania, although there are sizable differences across states, as the table below shows. In the median state, South Carolina, the decline in state appropriations explains 81 percent of the increase in tuition revenue. Only three states — Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming — have kept funding for higher education on pace with inflation and enrollment growth (represented by negative numbers in the table). In 17 states, the price of college would have actually\xa0declined\xa0since 2000 (states with a share greater than 100 percent in the table) if funding had been kept constant and the schools applied that money entirely to students’ tuition bills. While state funding has rebounded somewhat during the economic recovery following the Great Recession, most states’ increases have not kept pace with enrollment growth.']"

Trust the science!  …we’ve changed what we think because science changes.  Now trust the science!” -Science™️', 'This isn’t science by the way.', 'How else would you word it?   I mean “evolution is just a theory like the theory of gravity, oxygen theory, the germ theory of disease, or the theory about the shape of the Earth” does pretty much convey what I’m trying to say. I already said that we know the theory of gravity isn’t absolutely true and we also know that there’s a high possibility that all of these others will have some small mistakes that have been overlooked by practically everyone, but just treating the ideas as “best guess based on what we know so far” we just run into the opposite problem.  Then it turns into “you and I just interpret the same evidence differently.” How do you know it’s the best explanation so far? Doesn’t that require that you know that it’s more accurate (“factual”) than the other ideas put forth?   That’s why I said that it’s a fact that evolution happens and that it’s a fact that when we observe evolution happening that the theory describes what we observe. Mutations, heredity, genetic drift, selection, the whole bit. The theory may not be absolutely correct in every regard but it seems to be pretty damn close as we don’t find the same types of inconsistencies with the theory of biological evolution as we do when we try to make the theory of gravity work on the quantum scale.   At this point it’s time to just stop beating around the bush. The current theory of biological evolution is the only theory that still stands. There are possible ways it could be wrong and the corrections will be made as they are discovered but it’s not like Intelligent Design or some alternative idea is even in the same playing field. We shouldn’t give credence to ideas that don’t deserve it. We don’t have to wait for absolute truth to consider an idea correct.   “Factual” in the colloquial sense applies to things like the theory of evolution, the theory of oxygen, and the law of gravity. In science we just reserve “fact” for points of data. Theories are always open to revision **even if no revision is required** because if they weren’t they’d have to be replaced or we’d stay wrong. They remain the best explanation for the evidence so far and that stays the case even if they’re never falsified because they aren’t false.  Another way to look at it without calling the theory itself factual would be to consider every aspect of the theory and all of the sub-theories that make it up, such as the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, and work out how many times the theory is built upon and backed by factual data. Now we don’t have to call the theory a fact but any replacement to it will still have to account for all of the same facts the current theory already accounts for and it’ll have to do it in such a way that doesn’t rely on ad-hoc fallacies and apologetic excuses. It’ll have to be something built from the evidence rather than altered simply to avoid being precluded by it.']

That’s a false correlation. The system is broken; any decrease in rape convictions is not the result of the end of rape culture. It’s the *perpetuation* of rape culture because rapes are not reported and they aren’t prosecuted. They aren’t reported/prosecuted because the system does not fairly or effectively prosecute rapists.   Your reading on the cop rape loophole is extremely selective. Per the article I linked, “laws in 35 states allowed police officers to claim that a person in their custody consented to sex, and that of at least 158 law enforcement officers charged with sexual assault, sexual battery, or unlawful sexual contact with somebody under their control from 2006 to 2018, at least 26 were acquitted or had charges dropped based on the consent defense.”   If your response to that quotation is “well, most of them were charged with rape”, you’re ignoring the more important context that *police officers were acquitted of rape simply because they claimed that someone in their custody had consented to sex*. Please reflect on that claim. Why would someone in the custody of the cops want to have sex with them?   Thirdly, **no one** is going to go through the extremely invasive and traumatic process of having a rape kit completed if they had consensual sex. A rape kit takes several hours and involves having one’s genitals, pubic hair, rectums, and mouths swabbed, combed, scraped and photographed The point of a rape kit is not to prove that a woman is sexually active; it is to prove her claim that she was raped.   Here’s why this is important:           ([Source for above excerpts](https://www.forensicscolleges.com/blog/rape-test-kit-backlog))', ""Of course you care more about false rape accusations than actual rape victims. As a man you are more likely to be raped than to be falsely accused of rape, but we never see people like you caring about rape victims.

But Messi isn’t Müller, he’s more like Maradona or Cruyff. Maradona at Napoli scored less than 0.5 goals a game, lower everywhere else. Cruyff at Barcelona was about 0.35, 0.75 at Ajax. Messi is the second greatest goal scorer in European history despite being a versatile creative player who did most of his best work outside the box.  The only player I think you can make a good case for them being better than Messi is Pele. And there the arguments against *do* start to resemble the sorts of arguments you made - the standard of the Spanish league (and Champions League) in Messi’s time is higher than the Brazilian league (and competitive friendlies) in Pele’s time. But also consider that…  Pele ≈ Maradona   Maradona &lt; Messi   Therefore…    (I actually think there’s a strong case for Puskas being better than Pele or Müller, but Messi has more facets to his game than Puskas - he’s better in the air and actually has a right foot).  I don’t think Haaland will ever be compared favourably to Messi and Ronaldo unless he starts scoring from outside the box, scoring free kicks, and playing passes like Messi.

Illegal immigration is those that don't obey deportation orders, overstay visas, and things like that. Those that come here on tourist visas and then never leave.   Our immigration system should serve the interests of all Americans. And not just long-term economic growth, but also short term as well. Too many migrants increases pressure on housing in many parts of the country. Too many migrants in a short period can also have negative impacts on wage growth, but I don't think that is an issue we really need to be concerned with at this point.

This will make it more difficult for some to immigrate here lawfully, but the points system can be adjusted based on our need. If we need more carpenters, then we can prioritize that.   We should also require that anyone seeking to immigrate here either via the points system or asylum must cross at an official port of entry. Crossing anywhere else should be immediate deportation.

Well, not always, anyway.  Being a landlord is not without risk.  If you rent out to the wrong person, they can absolutely destroy the property, making it useless as a habitable space.  This is a reasonably common occurrance. If that happens, the landlord is responsible for cleaning up the mess.   Though I would agree that there are currently too many landlords, too few homes available for purchase, and an affordability crisis, I believe that having some rentals available for people is necessary, and that landlords can provide a service that has value.    Rentals allow people to have a temporary home.  This is desirable for most people at certain stages of life.  People will opt to rent rather than buy if they expect to need to move in the near future.  It allows them to avoid the hassle and costs/risk of buying and selling a home (if you were doing this once a year, the relator fees could very well be more than rent would have been, and you risk losing money if you buy in a hot market and sell in a cool one).  Rentals allow people with tight budgets to smooth their housing costs.  If you are working with narrow margins, being forced to pay $15000 for a burst main and flood damage all at once can be financially ruinous.  Landlords accept the responsibility for property maintenance and absorption of large costs.  If they are good at thier job, this will mean being better at preventative maintenance and being better able to negotiate repair costs than the average home owner.  Even if a renter has enough money to take on risks like this, many really just don't want to. They find value in paying someone else to handle it.   Again, I largely agree with your overall point, but It does seem that you're conflating literal housing rents with economic rent-seeking (looking to get something for nothing, basically) and I don't think that is quite right.  I mean, a shady landlord CAN be a rent seeker (if they increase costs and or neglect their responsibilites to extract a higher profit while providing nothing additional to the renter, for example) but it doesn't follow that the service has no fair value at all."", 'Landlords are literally not rent-seekers though (in the economic sense), since they actually do work and provide value in property maintenance and improvement.  Edit: and to answer some of the questions below, you should really look up what ""rent seeking"" actually means. Even just providing the money for improvements and maintenance already means the landlord is providing economic value, and is therefore not rent seeking.  As for what the economic justification is? It\'s valuable to have housing available that has low transaction and up front costs and where the catastrophic or surprise financial risk (if, say, a tree falls on your roof or the water heater floods) is largely borne by a third party. Renting is in many ways superior to ownership if you don\'t have a significant savings buffer and/or if you won\'t be living at a single location long term, and obviously for that to be possible, someone needs to be offering units for rent.  (This doesn\'t mean all landlords are good, nor does it mean a landlord can\'t also exhibit some rent seeking behavior such as lobbying for zoning restrictions that benefit them as a landlord, but landlording, in and of itself, is not rent seeking)', 'A landlord could lower the rent.']"

I had said that in response to you saying that people violating gun laws are thrown into jail to reduce suicides. I responded by saying that they are thrown into jail because they violated a law. Go back to that comment if you don’t believe me. My mistake was using the word “should” instead of the word “are”. But I clarified my meaning. I also clarified that punishment for violating laws occurs because that’s how laws fundamentally work. If they didn’t, no one would follow any laws. After that, I also made it clear that if a law itself is unethical, it should be reformed because enforcing it would be unethical. Just because something is legal doesn’t mean it’s ethical. I didn’t make up any new standards. This is quite literally common sense and anyone with common sense would agree with me.    No, I brought up fundamental differences between guns and alcohol that makes your analogy invalid. In case you don’t know how analogies work, the comparison has to be valid 1) Alcohol is something that people consume for fun, and if used in moderation, it has minimal health risks. It isn’t normally used to hurt people and it doesn’t cause mass murder. The examples you brought up about the driving accidents are examples where alcohol is illegal: you can’t drive while drunk. 2) Guns are dangerous killing machines that have the ability to cause mass murders. I can give you a long list of examples of schools shootings and people using guns to mass murder people. They have no use unless you want to hurt people. If you want to do target practice, you can use paintball guns, other fake guns, or just go to a shooting range where you can use a gun for target practice. If you want to protect yourself, you can use knives, hammers, or any other household object.     I didn’t create any standards. Multiple standards already exist and I brought those into the discussion to refute the absurd claims you were making. For example, you said people should be killed because they aren’t needed like guns. And I said that people are sentient beings, not guns. This is an objective fact, not just some random standard I made up. Another example: where I said that if a law is unethical, it should be changed. Again, I didn’t make up a new standard. Ask anyone and they will agree with me. I again just brought it into the conversation to refute your claims. I didn’t just make it up.   It’s funny you are the one saying that, the person that compared getting rid of guns to getting rid of people (who are sentient living beings, not objects like guns) and the same person who compared enforcing gun laws to the holocaust (which is one of the biggest atrocities committed in history). I never once said that no person has been protected by a gun. I said that there are literal studies that prove that guns harm more than they protect. Saying ownership of explosives is illegal is not psychotic, it’s the law and for good reason. They are extremely dangerous. I also gave you many options that fulfill the same purpose as guns, so there’s no need to have guns.    Nope. Drunk driving is one scenario where alcohol is harmful and that’s why we have laws against it. Alcohol otherwise used in moderation has minimal health risks. Guns are inherently dangerous and lethal. I’ve given you alternatives for all the uses of guns, so there’s no need to own something so dangerous.

All proceeds are ""escheat"" to the government, all tax deeds are subject to every existing right. Federal Direct Tax on land, ""as is where is"". All administration is market-based and privately motivated.   Funding is derived from the printing press, taxation gives purchase to the value of money. It only takes a stable base of 2-3% ""cash"" and the money supply is virtually guaranteed. Anyway, selling off or taxing all the land in America is a huge fund.   The land will bear as much tax as the market will bear, which is the same right now with the multiplicity of tax systems. It\'s not like income taxes are better at extracting wealth than land taxes, it\'s really much worse. The tax on land is only limited by the alternative of going to auction, and developed property is held to the demand of land taxes.  There\'s at least 1 billion good acres in the USA, if it had to carry 5 trillion dollars of real spending... do the math.       All labor will be freed from the burden of land payments, so it\'s a huge trade-off. We mostly use collateral just to pay for land itself. And of course, there\'s a lot of personal credit which is given to property itself, and business.   The development or improvement is the collateral already, and on the small level, it promotes cash basis. $50,000 junk box houses in the Rust Belt should trade for $10,000.    It\'s the same payment anyway, but in a different approach that\'s way more efficient. In reality, the best way to buy undeveloped land is from the government directly at tax auction, which sets the price much lower and the tax abated for at least 10 years. Nobody has to actually pay anything, it\'s just a lien which grows against the parcel.     Well for one, pay the tax. Or let it ride for 20 years until the taxes build up to the value of the property, and only then it goes up for sale and still follows 10 years of litigation and process.  You could answer a lot of these questions much better by understanding how tax sales work, nothing happens constantly or instantly.    No tax is passed down to renters, owners charge what the market will bear anyway. Land is inelastic in that sense, and rent will be much cheaper along all other prices of real estate. Everything comes down to supply and demand, high tax on land itself forces the sale into the market. Greatly increasing supply, which lowers price.  Rent will probably disappear, because there\'s so much less involved. At a certain point, with fixed margins and overhead it\'s probably more worthwhile to just sell the place then try to rent it out. That\'s putting aside the fact that rent does not exist, it\'s a property relationship.    An incredibly large amount of land is already vacant. Either it gets sold off and taken into private occupancy, or just stays public. That doesn\'t make any government the ""owner"" of land, it means the land is open for taking. Most land should revert to commons.   The United States is a huge market and there\'s a demand for the facilities. The abolition of other taxes can only incentivize remaining in the United States, it had become the most attractive place for investment in the world.  In reality, if the USA was to abolish all tax except for land tax, it would force the exact same policy around the world just by competition.', 'This but land tax']"

I think you fail to see the basic premise of the guy you are responding to.   If you take both concepts and place them at full scale efficiency hydrogen still won\'t beat out straight EV. You have middle man components that adds a time and cost that simply don\'t exist in an EV car, regardless of the abundance of hydrogen. The reason EVs are winning the ""climate friendly"" race is because energy companies (fossil fuels included) see this as the easiest route for world wide infrastructure. You just build the cars, pop up charging stations slowly, and upgrade the electric grid slowly. It\'s completely doable and still within the ""get in early for max profits"" phase, for hydrogen someone has to come in and fight (spend money) against that giant machine that is already rolling and no one wants to do it, especially considering building such a network and concept is going to be way more expensive.  What\'s probably going to happen is that every day consumer vehicles will be EV, long commute and heavy vehicles like planes and eighteen wheelers will be a mix of EV and hydrogen.', ' BEVs are indeed more efficient, but the Tesla chargers along the way would require being able to deliver at any moment in time the full current needed for a 70% ""quick"" charge, that for an increasing number of Tesla trucks on the road. That is on top of the car supercharger network that they still need to maintain.  If a person in an electric Tesla car arrives at a supercharger and for some reason there is a wait time or the supercharger delivers a limited charging rate, that\'s inconvenient but not a big deal for most cases. However that can\'t simply not happen with trucks, or companies and truckers will run away from that.  I honestly don\'t think Tesla will be able to honor their claim of green energy for Tesla trucks in their super chargers. Most renewables have an intermittent production, therefore energy must be stored locally at the supercharger site. Since it\'s Tesla we are talking about that would be for sure stored in batteries... which again would be better used in city cars. Tesla can plug the truck superchargers into the grid, but then it\'s going to be hard for them to guarantee a constant charging rate for the semi trucks.  Hydrogen refueling is almost as quick as diesel refueling, wait times are less of an issue in this case. Also, hydrogen refueling stations do not need to produce hydrogen insitu, hydrogen can be carried around like we do with Diesel. It just solves so many hurdles...  Think about it: Tesla is not putting batteries into everything that moves because it\'s what makes the most sense in each case. They are just monetizing the tech they acquired and work well for cars.

The homosexuality moral does have a reason behind it. How do you determine what’s a *good* reason and what’s not? What makes you qualified to decide what’s a good reason or not? (I don’t mean that in a rude way) All of that would be subjective right? Hence why morality is subjective.

Hence why morality is subjective.   What you’re proposing is not an objective definition of what’s moral but rather a logical definition of how to *enforce* morality, which I already talked about in a previous comment.

If I decide to force my morals on others, they can force their morals on me and effectively cancel out whatever I do with my morals. So logically speaking, you have to let everyone practice their own morals without inflicting it on others. But that doesn’t mean that morality itself has an objective definition. Going back to the cow example, I’ve decided that it’s immoral to eat cows and I have a reason to back that up. As long as I don’t force it others and they don’t force their morals on me, we’re all good.', 'The definition of what’s moral itself is always subjective   However, the only logical aspect of morality are that you can’t force your own morals on others and that you have to be consistent in your morals. And the reason why I say that is that if you force your morals on others, they can do the same by your own standards, and that would be paradoxical. For example, if I force you to give me your shirt on the basis that it’s moral for me to do so, then you can just force me to give it back by my own morals, and we would be back where we were.  So maintaining moral consistency and respecting individual boundaries in morality are the only logical aspects of morality. The actual definition of what is or isn’t moral is entirely subjective. I can say that wearing a red shirt is immoral, and that would just be my own subjective definition of morality.']

I have specific examples where people benefit from regular therapy. This isn’t to say it’s for everyone or that everyone would benefit from regular therapy. Same goes for physical fitness.   Some people don’t want or need a personal trainer to be physically fit. Some people do. And going to one helps you in objective ways. The same is true for therapy.

You’re working backward from “I’m right and nothing will change my mind”. That’s why you deny the existence of the specific group of people I mentioned who choose to go to regular therapy to maximize their mental fitness.   I’m working from “therapy helps these people stay mentally fit”. You’re choosing to listen to yourself over others while saying others are saying “I’m right and I know what’s best”. Your argument is pure projection.   You’re making a blanket statement that regular therapy doesn’t and can’t work. All I have to do is give one example of it working for someone and benefiting them to prove you wrong. Which I’ve done. You refusing to acknowledge that reality isn’t an argument. And you saying “nope. They don’t exist/they’d be better off without therapy/therapy is bad for them” isn’t an argument.   I’m not making a blanket statement. I’m saying regular therapy can help people. To prove me wrong, you need to prove that regular therapy in all cases is bad and never works. You haven’t done that. You’ve simply repeatedly said “I’m right. Therapy is bad”.  And then you pretend all therapy is fixing someone, when that’s not why all people go to therapy. Some go to stay mentally fit, not to get better. Your refusal to a acknowledge this group of people and respond is a forfeiting response.   I give examples of refusal therapy helping people and you respond with examples of how it could be bad, which is irrelevant to the examples I gave and my argument still stands.

(Side note: at no point was I saying that you didn’t care about them, I was making the point that the DoD didn’t care) Why is it they all those victims of sexual assault not part of your calculation of “loyalty.” What about the work sucking and the shitty pay? Does that factor into the military’s loyalty?  If the point was to have a ideologically loyal military regardless of strength, why wouldn’t they encourage more women and gays to join by actually preventing them from getting raped? If they wanted college educated soy boys to join more, why would they be reducing ASVAB requirements and paying only slightly more? Wouldn’t they start coming up with reasons to reject recruiting from demographically conservative places like Texas and Florida, when those states are actually recruited more per capita than any other state? Why not drop recruitment numbers and just focus on blue states?  If loyalty is the concern, why do a majority of American vets find a lot of non-ideological reasons to hate the military when they get out?', ' Again, thank you for telling me about the cultural context of the organization I’ve been inextricably a part of for 7 years person who’s not even from this fucking country. That is literally what happened you fucking dope. 10% of the American military sees active combat: the majority of the American military, including the Marines, are non-physical administrative and support roles. *Material* changes to those gender and sexual orientation restrictions were implemented to increase the potential recruitment pool without significantly increasing compensation and pay, the PR therein was just a secondary benefit. Just like it is in any other industry that wants to expand its labor pool. *Appearing* to be inclusive is the goal behind actually getting more numbers in the board.  Physical fitness standards have been loosening in the military for years. Is it because they don’t want to be fatphobic? No, it’s because the majority of enlisted roles are technical and they were losing out on retention and recruitment goals on those technical roles since America as a whole has gotten fatter. Now active field and combat roles have additional physical requirements.  The American military has also started to loosen its rules regarding usage of marijuana and anti-depressants for new recruits. Is it because they believe these people are heckin valid and vouch for #selfcare? No, it’s because it’s becoming more legalized and that they were loosing out on recruitment goals by precluding people who smoked. They still ban marijuana usage while active and severely limit access to psychotic medications because **ding ding ding** readiness matters most.  And yeah, please go to literally any forum with actual active duty members who were around since the changes in allowing homosexuals, and every single one of them will tell you that DADT wasn’t enforced and that homosexuals were serving openly prior to the official integration in 2011, because people in the military aren’t some monolith and they don’t actually care about that kind of shit, they just care that people do their jobs.  I literally had a drill instructor that was a flaming gay man that called everyone ratchet. 25% of my recruit division was too stupid to even notice that he was gay, and not a single person in bootcamp actually gave a fuck that he was a) because he was a good instructor and b) because we were significantly more worried about doing what we were supposed to be doing, not worrying about being indoctrinated. He only ever officially disclosed his orientation to a recruit on the last day during a relaxed Q&amp;A about Fleet life when a recruit asked if he was ever scared during DADT. He literally said to them “no one cares that you’re gay, just do your fucking job.”  Because the only thing that actually matters from the enlisted personnel is their role as a *LABOR FORCE.* The DoD has, and will continue to, shift their cultural decrees and public relations stances for the purpose of maximizing their recruitment pool and effectiveness of extraction of labor from their workforce, regardless of who is in power “in the regime.”', ' Oh hey, look at that, a direct quote from a General with the material justification for a progressive policy. Absolutely incredible to me that you quote that SCOTUS case without any irony despite the actual argument West Point is making about how the officer corps needs diversity in order to more effectively organize the labor of the enlisted military. Almost as if this “ideological purity” they’re striving for is a position who’s primary purpose is to maximize the effectiveness of extracting labor from the enlisted. Rather than arguing with their material claims or conclusions, you just write off the decision as being “ideologically motivated.”   Inb4 you act like I approve of West Points argument: I don’t, simply because people by and large don’t actually care about racial representation in their leadership, they just want good leaders who have similar material contexts. West Point goes wrong when they think a poor black enlisted person would be better off with rich black officer, when in reality a poor black enlisted person would have a better functional relationship with a white officer who grew up in comparable material conditions.   Yeah man, any time they do something you ideologically agree with it’s because they’re trying to trick you or play the long game despite the risk that’d supposedly have on their ideological purity a year away from an election. There’s no material explanation like recruitment and retention that better explains it.   You know enlisted branches don’t even have diversity quotas right? Even in your West Point example, that was a studied they did with regards to race balancing in context of reflecting the racial make up of the enlisted sections of the military. The service academies are legally excerpt from Affirmative Action and are statistically less diverse than non-service Universities. Again, I’ll say this till I’m blue in the face, please give me any proof that the *enlisted military* has any ideological requirements of its labor force and how those trump the effectiveness of those peoples’ labor.     That’s exactly my point! The military establishment was literally *behind* the culture and ideological context of its labor force! It was literally illegal to be gay but the culture of the labor force was able to counteract that **top down** policy because they cared more about the work getting done. Funny that when it’s a conservative ideologically position it’s “lingering” but when it’s a progressive one it’s “unanimously unpopular and ideological warfare.”    I don’t even disagree with you doofus. My point is that progressivism is only a tool in order to maximize the extraction of labor, and that progressivism will be thrown out in favor of conservatism if Capital seems if and when it’s effective to do so. But to use your homosexuality example, why is it that when something because popular enough you just don’t have to call it progressive regardless of what legal and political power is behind that idea?  Again, if you’re gonna wax poetic about culture and ideology, at least talk to real people about it for 5 fucking seconds before assuming some bullshit study that won’t even be implemented is more important than labor conditions.']

So he doesn't count. Where's a prominent leader voted out by the people?   1939 is after 1921 and after 1934, so I dont care. Its besides the point. The Poles were able to send up to 700k troops and the French 3 million. The French leadership turned out to be cowards and lost their country as a result, quite deservingly. The USSR wasn't even necessary to counter the Germans in 1939 had the Western allies put their heart into the 1939 offensive. Fortunately they helped the USSR out a lot with lend lease and strategic bombing campaigns.  Since we're stuck on ww2 for some reason or another let me close with Phillips P. O'Brien in the Journal of Strategic Studies, East versus West in the defeat of Nazi Germany  from the evidence in the survey is that the Second World War in Europe was, economically speaking, an air war. The German war economy was geared, more than anything else, to the construction and supply of aircraft and anti-air weaponry. In the crucial year of 1943, more than 41 per cent of German munitions production was devoted to making aircraft alone.  The next closest area, at a little more than 29 per cent, was ammunition, followed by naval vessels at 8.43 per cent, weapons (from anti-aircraft guns to artillery pieces to small arms) at 8.02 per cent, motor vehicles at 4.08 per cent, and halftracks at 1.78 per cent. The production of Panzers, considered the queen of the battlefields on the Eastern Front, took up only 6.27 per cent of German war production. In other words tank production took up only three-quarters as much of German production as naval construction, and less than one-sixth as much of German production as aircraft building. The domination of aircraft production continued for the rest of the war. In 1944 the percentage of the German economy devoted to building planes rose and in July of that year, when overall German munitions production reached its peak, over 48 per cent of German war production was aircraft. A further way of measuring the importance of aircraft production within the framework of the German economy can be seen not only by measuring the value of product assigned to each combatant service, but in the allocation of the German workforce. In a speech given by Albert Speer in August 1944, the Reichminister stated that even after the enormous relative increases in tank and self-propelled gun production achieved since early 1943, aircraft production still occupied far more workers than any other single part of the German war economy.   At that time more than 2,100,000 workers were involved in aircraft production while only 1,900,000 were involved in all army production, and 500,000 were employed by the navy. The preeminence of aircraft construction in economic production should lead to a reevaluation of how exactly Germany was defeated. This can best be done by looking at 1943, a year which is often seen as the turning point of the Second World War in Europe. The year 1943 is crucial for several reasons. In 1939 and 1940 the Germans were primarily occupied fighting the West, while in 1941 and 1942 the war against Russia received the highest priority. In 1943, however, the Germans came under attack from both sides. It was the year that saw the great Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk, victories that ended the possibility of any further German strategic offensives on the Eastern Front. In the West, 1943 was when the British and Americans launched their invasions of Sicily and Italy, and began the first large-scale strategic bombing campaign against Germany. Thus, 1943 is also regularly used by those who like to minimise the West's contribution to the defeat of Germany. Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk are thus described as vital steps in the defeat of Germany, while the Anglo-American strategic bombing offensive is usually denigrated. The year 1943 is also important because it was the first year during which German armaments production began to expand dramatically. German war production, as is widely known, was surprisingly limited during the first years of the Second World War. Inefficient utilisation of economic resources in 1939, 1940, and 1941 led to only marginal increases. Between the beginning of 1940 and the end of 1941, total German armament production hardly increased at all.16  In almost every area of weaponry Germany was actually outproduced, in quantity if not in quality, by its opponents before 1943. From this point on home defense received the lion's share of new German production. By 1 January 1944, over 54 per cent of all Luftwaffe operational front-line aircraft strength was in Germany or the West resisting the bomber offensive, with an additional 10 per cent in the Mediterranean and approximately 35 per cent on the Eastern Front.  This kind of deployment would continue for much of the rest of the war. At the same time that the West was soaking up more and more German air resources, it was destroying proportionally more and more as well. Air combat for the Luftwaffe was always more dangerous against the British and Americans than against the Russians. The technological inferiority of the Soviets led to a considerably smaller percentage of German losses on the Eastern Front, even when the Luftwaffe was greatly outnumbered by the Red Air Force. As a point of comparison 3,936 German planes were lost fighting the British and American air forces in the Mediterranean between January and November 1943, while only 3,773 aircraft were lost on the Eastern Front.  When one adds the even larger figure of 4,225 aircraft lost in either Western Europe or the defense of the Reich in the same period, it becomes clear that the British and Americans played by far the largest role in tying down and destroying the German air force in 1943. In percentage terms about 68.5 per cent of all German losses were caused by the British and Americans and the remaining 31.5 per cent by the Russians. These increased losses are extremely important because 1943, as said above, was a year in which German aircraft production leapt markedly. Almost all of this increase occurred in fighter construction. In 1943 the Germans built 10,898 fighters compared to 5,515 the year before.39 However, the Germans were unable to reap any advantage from this extremely large production increase because it was almost all diverted or destroyed by the even larger effort put forward by the Western Allies. Instead of being able to overwhelm the technologically-inferior Russian Air Force on the Eastern Front, the Luftwaffe saw its newest and most professional units continually ground down over Germany's own skies. Again, when one compares the allocation of German fighters at the beginning and the end of 1943 the importance of the West stands out clearly. In January 1943 1,045 single-engine and twin-engine fighters were based in the West running from Norway to Germany into France. At the same time280 fighters were based in the Mediterranean and Balkans, and 445 were fighting in Russia. By 1 January 1944 the number of German fighters in the West had grown by 605 to 1,650, while the corresponding figures for the Mediterranean had grown by 85 to 365 and that for the Eastern Front had actually dropped by 20 to 425.

Plus, the physical dispensaries always throw in extras. The last one I went to gave me about $100 in product above what I purchased. But, since I don't go very often, I buy the legal maximum amount each time."", ""It's insane.

Recreational dispensaries will be open near me within a few weeks, so at least that takes care of the drive, but our medical prices are in line with MA's recreational already so I can't imagine they'll be any *less* expensive.  Black market all the way for me, for now.  I really don't get it either; I'm perfectly willing to throw tax revenue at my state and city, but not when it's going to double my monthly costs.  Edit: not that it's the most important thing, but I forgot to include the $2.50 ATM fee because the dispensaries can't get actual banking services so they have to act as an ATM then pay themselves the cash.  Fucking ridiculous.""]"

C'est plus ridicule que ton argument est de dire que les gouvernements élus démocratiquement ont supprimé ça. Pour moi c'est contradictoire. Les québécois sont un peuple fier mais à même temps ils sont un peu de soumis. Dis-moi comment est-ce que ce que tu dis fait du sens ?    C'est une excuse, c'est ce que tu dis. Si le fédéral avait triché, et les séparatistes avaient évidence ils pouvaient faire quelque chose. Je ne sais pas si t'as réalisé mais c'est impossible d'argumenter en contre de toi. Il y a une explication pour tout sans importance s'ils sont ridicules et irréalistes.    C'est trop mal pour eux, mais le fédéral est correct. Ford et Smith sont un peu d'imbéciles et ils veulent détruire le système de la santé. Tu pense seulement au Québec.

C'est une stupidité complète de faire ça, et les nouvelles lois l'ont fait plus difficile, chose avec laquelle je n'ai pas de problème. Même si la plupart qui viennent ici apprendre.  Pour conclure ces statistiques m'indique qu'il y à plus gens qui parle les deux langues au lieu d'un. Pourquoi est-ce que c'est mauvais ?  C'est comme j'avais dis, c'est pas sur le français, c'est sur le séparatisme et son manque de pertinence.

Tu ne peux pas juste venir ici, dire que le ""non"" a volé le referendum et que leurs gouvernements ont supprimé le mouvement de l\'indépendance.  J\'ai besoin de plus qu\'articles et choses qu\'un juge avait dit. En plus, il n\'y a pas d\'outrage, si les choses que t\'as dites étaient vraies, la société québécoise n\'aurait jamais accepté ça. Ce que tu dis est impossible, et si c\'est un point commun des souverainistes, il sera moins possible de que je leur donne mon soutien. On ne peut pas simplement nier le choix des gens, et le choix dans 1995 était ""non"". Si tu veux une autre referendum, bien, tu peux exiger ça, mais tu ne peux jamais dire que les choix des gens sont invalides à cause de spéculation des articles.   Oui, et c\'est pour ça que le Québec à pouvoir pour changer ces décisions, en plus d\'avoir un parti fédéral, chose que les autres provinces n\'ont pas. Je suis désolée, mais ces choses sont les conditions pour être partie du Canada, chose que le Québec avait décidé de faire dans 1980 et 1995. C\'est la loi, si tu ne l\'aimes pas, chiale aux autres québécois qui ont décidé de rester au Canada.

C\'est assez, il n\'y aura jamais un compromis entre moi et les séparatistes. Je voterai toujours contre eux. Leur cause ne m\'a pas donné une bonne raison de penser qu\'ils savent que c\'est ce qu\'ils font. Tes arguments moins.  Je ne vois pas une voie ou je serai d\'accord avec l\'indépendance. Ce mouvement est un poison, et c\'est plein de fanatiques.', "" C'est la nature de ces choses, t'as ton point de vue et j'ai le mien, mais peut-être, il y a un compromis. Je continuerai cette conversation en français, et nous nous comprendrons dans la langue du Québec.    Plus évidence. Je ne crois pas qu'un article de 2013 et une affirmation d'un juge sont assez pour dire que le referendum était invalide.  Non, c'est pas assez, si tu vas dire ces choses, to dois avoir évidence qui le confirme 100%. Comprends-tu ce que tu dis ? C'est une accusation sérieuse et si les choses étaient comme ça, alors, j'aurais attendu à un outrage. La société québécoise n'aurait jamais accepté ça.    Dans les médias anglos. Qu'est-ce que tu vas dire ? Que ça ne compte pas ? Pourquoi pas ? Non, c'est complètement raciste. Il y avait un million d'autres choses à dire et PSPP avait choisi de dire le n-word et de forcer à une autre personne a le dire aussi. Les deux chefs séparatistes l'ont dit, en face d'une femme noire, en plus du monde entier. Plus tu combats ce point, moins je fais confiance à ce mouvement. Il y a 0 justifications pour ce comportement, 0. C'est pas une chose culturelle, non, on ne dit jamais le n-word, et ce n'est pas une chose anglaise. Si tu penses d'autre manière, je mets au défi d'aller dire ça au milieu de la rue.  En France, on ne peut pas dire ces choses, moins à Montréal. Il n'y a aucune raison pourquoi je devrais accepter ce type de choses dans un débat télévisé.    Oui, c'est pas facile pour moi. J'aime le Québec, plus que mon ancien pays. Québec c'est chez-moi. Je ne veux pas avoir à choisir entre eux, et les séparatistes ne comprennent pas la difficulté de ces choses pour nous, les immigrants. Il y a plusieurs personnes que disaient de choses méchantes pour nos choix. Nous n'avons pas choisi d'être insérés dans ce conflit, mais nous recevons les balles des deux côtés. Oui, il y a des anglos imbéciles qui viennent à dire choses tout le temps, spécialement quand on défend aux québécois et au Québec. Ils ont beaucoup à dire aussi. Par exemple, je suis d'accord que le serment au roi est une stupidité. Un imbécile anglo m'avait dit que c'était temps pour moi de sortir du Canada, et que si on était dans les temps anciens, ils m'auraient viré sans problème et qu'il n'aurait pas de problème avec ça.   La seule chose que j'exige est respect. On peut croire ce qu'on veut, mais je ne comprends pas pourquoi je devrais supporter des choses comme ça.    Non, jamais, nous sommes Canadiens, pas Américains. C'est pas la même  chose de toute façon. Si le Québec sorti, Canada ne sera jamais le même chose. En plus, sais-tu les implications de ça ? Il y a plusieurs complications comme les disputes de territoire avec les autochtones, le St. Laurent, les traitres de commerce avec les [États-Unis](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/u-s-wouldn-t-have-recognized-quebec-independence-in-wake-of-yes-vote-in-1995-1.1730253). C'est un cauchemar social, économique et politique pour tout le monde.   Quand les séparatistes attendent mon soutien, ils attendent que je suis à faveur de potentiellement détruire le Canada. Ça n'arrivera jamais, pas pour moi.    Je ne sais pas, pourquoi est-ce que tu continues de faire référence à ce thème si t'as cette opinion ?    C'est pas vrai. Je suis immigrant, et je sais comme le système fonctionne. Tu ne peux pas immigrer au Québec de la même manière que le reste du Canada. Si tu fais ça, tu devrais traiter avec le gouvernement Québécois et t'as besoin de suivre leurs procédures. Si tu ne connais pas le français, bonne chance, tu ne vas pas rester au Québec. En plus, c'est pas assez d'obtenir autorisation du gouvernement québécois, tu devrais traiter avec le fédéral aussi.  Le Québec a beaucoup de pouvoir pour choisir leurs immigrants, plus que les autres provinces.    Ouais, et rappelle une chose, j'ai choisi de faire ça. Ma langue maternelle est l'espagnol, ils ne parlent pas français à mon ancien pays. J'ai fait ça avant d'arriver au Canada, qui est 130% plus que tous les autres immigrants, et en plus que les Canadiens eux-mêmes qui rarement parlent français.    J'ai choisi le Québec et Montréal comme chez-moi, pas Toronto et l'Ontario, pas Calgary et l'Alberta, et pas Vancouver et la Colombie-Britannique. C'est beaucoup d'exiger que mon opinion soit respecté ? Je ne suis pas un colonisateur, un partisan qui suivre les ordres du fédéral ou un envahisseur qui vient à supprimer la culture québécoise.   Je pense que t'es raisonnable. Ne pense pas tu, que c'est injuste quand les autres séparatistes disent ces choses méchantes ? Ne penses-tu pas que j'ai mes raisons pour ne pas vouloir soutenir un mouvement qui a des gens qui disent ces choses. En plus je ne suis pas comme les autres immigrants, s'il y a gens qui veulent trouver problèmes avec moi, je vais les faire pour eux. Je ne suis pas un tabarnak, je ne reculerai pas.""]"

You are stating that to prove we have free will, you would have to prove that life is not deterministic. But logically, life must be deterministic, so that cannot be disproven. However, while it is easy to give evidence that life is deterministic, you have no evidence that the fact that it is deterministic means you cannot simultaneously have free will.  Compatibilism holds that determinism can exist simultaneously with autonomy. I somewhat agree with this, but I do not believe necessarily that people have full autonomy. Compatibiliists also believe, if I understand correctly, that humans are either free or they are not. I do not agree with that. I am saying that there's every possibility that humans are both free and not free simultaneously. And that possibility could exist in different forms. Perhaps it means people are partially free. Or perhaps it means that Free Will and Not Free Will are not true opposites. Or perhaps it means that they are different dimensions of something larger. I know what I'm saying is hard to understand. That's why I used the examples. You are right that the computer one is a poor one.  And I wasn't clear whether you were stating that autonomy is synonymous with free will. Since you reject the analogy of pouring water on someone, clearly you don't see them as the same. I think the equator analogy fits my view best. Regardless of the river analogy, and whether you can move side to side, on the equator if you go exactly down the line, you are going a straight line. You cannot deviate. However, that straight line is also a circle when looked at from a different dimension. Or an oval when looked at through another one. What I'm getting at is that free will and determinism are not necessarily the same measurement even if they are measuring the same thing."", ""Well for a start, your original definition of determinism is obviously incorrect because clearly every person has a will. But it states that they do not. You post is not even questioning whether people have will or not. You are questioning whether that will is free. For instance, if I pour a glass of water on your lap, I did that because I wanted to. That is my will. But was that decision free to make? That is the biggest problem with your original definitions.  Now, as to disproving your main argument, you seem to believe that because people's actions are predetermined, that they cannot also choose to do those actions. However, that is not necessarily the case. It is very common in the Americas and Europe to think that two opposites cannot coexist, cannot be partially true, or cannot be both false. However, often in life these are not the case. For example, is the equator a straight line or a circle? It is both. Are dogs dangerous or safe? Both. Neither.  It depends. Similarly, both Free Will and determinism can coexist. Here are some scenarios to help explain:  1) Perhaps life is like a river. You are forced to go down it, and you cannot fight the current so nothing you do will make you go down any slower. However, you do not need to fight the current to go side to side. So while your destination is predetermined, you are still making your own actions in some ways.   2) If you design a true AI, and then ask it whether it would like an apple, it chooses that apple for itself. But at the same time, you designed the programming that let it choose that apple, and you engineer the situation that gave it that apple. So in that way, even though it is a pure AI, it is not making its own choice. Yet, it is. So from its perspective, it does have free will, but from our perspective, it only has partial free will. One might say the same about god. From and overarching perspective, we have no free will, but from an individual perspective, we do.  3) There are consequences for the actions you do, if I were to pour water on your lap, what would be your response? You would probably yell at me and tell me not to do that. But why? If life is deterministic, by your argument I didn't have a choice in the matter. But clearly, I did.  4) Perhaps free will and determinism aren't reversible at all and perhaps that is a logical or mathematical fallacy. Perhaps they are related or dependent on each other, but not on the same scale. When one thing leads to another, that doesn't mean the reverse will also be true. For instance, if I said that all people would like to die rather than be brain dead, it is not also true that all people would like to live if they're not brain dead."", 'People have free will']"

We\'re going to have to pass, we\'re a Magento shop""  Not really trying to shit on bootcamps or routes that get people to where they want to go, it just seems so hit or miss. I know some can succeed but it seems likely the majority of people will take out a loan and just go into debt while the few that do succeed are a good fit for the job and would have succeeded regardless.', '    Many different bootcamps have different expectations and market different outcomes. You\'re talking about a strawman bootcamp, so it\'s hard to really nail down exactly what\'s being advertised, how the program works, and whether or not it really is a scam. Your depiction of this strawman bootcamp sure sounds like a scam, but pointing out counter-examples can\'t really disprove this strawman argument without a more specific example.  I\'m talking about any camp that claims to get people sustainable high paying work quickly. Maybe some of these camps are really good at networking but my experience has been devs that can\'t keep up lose their job and any junior making 75k+ is likely to be seen as disposable.      Not all bootcamps are ”0 XP to $75k in 6 months"". Not sure if this is in line with your question given my previous point, but I do think there\'s value in bootcamps focusing existing knowledge to hirable skills.  There is absolutely value in focusing on hirable skills. My skepticism comes from the ads selling the salary vs the experience. It just seems like a red flag given most people going to those bootcamps don\'t even know basic html. Some camps maybe legit but many of the ads are an immediate turn off.', ""Bootcamps can be good. The issue I'm raising is cost and the perception I have that they market mostly to non devs that just want a large paycheck. People that enjoy dev work can likely benefit but many just pay thousands and go no where. The people that do succeed could probably get by without a camp. Camps can be a good experience as many have pointed out but given so much of dev work is self learning at some point is just doesn't seem worth it.""]"

Again, it\'s wealth, more than education which directly impacts crime and criminality (I was talking specifically about commission of crimes rather than prevention through better enforcement, but of course you\'d be correct if you said that we can\'t know commission rates accurately without good enforcement, so it still seems to follow that wealth is the single biggest factor, since we would expect *more* crime to be reported among the wealthy, all else equal, yet we see less...and it probably way less, because it gets reported less among the poor).   I don\'t believe we have good evidence for that one way or another. I\'m sure it will be a mix.  But in any case, these are all motives which are most directly affected by wealth/poverty.  You can find the dumbest low-life out there, and they almost certainly at one point or another, regurgitated to themselves or others, the wisdom of not getting addicted to drugs, or not acting greedily or rashly, but to instead plan and work hard and save (and get educated) and move out of the hood or away from temptations.  They all *know* better (in fact I\'d argue that they know it better, and feel it more deeply, than any highly educated person who\'s never had to grow up in the hood or slums or favellas or whatever).   Sure...again, I might not be understanding you, but I think that they tend to focus more on policies which prioritize education than on wealth; and even when they focus on wealth its always only transfers or welfare...not ways to invigorate people\'s economic opportunities and engender the purpose and dignity and self-respect which tend to come with economic growth, especially building a career or a business.  Prioritizing education though does have a lot of other benefits for reducing crime; given the poor conditions that many kids find themselves in, just being in school instead of on the streets does alleviate a lot of opportunity for crime. So that\'s probably the most powerful mechanism for education to directly affect crime.   It depends what we mean by regulation. Government regulation and intervention occur in layers...there\'s always unintended consequences and failures and political externality which plague government action; from the very basic existence of the state which can be captured, to the highest level, esoteric financial regulations meant to tweak some tiny incentive among investment bankers; and while they are often a net-negative on the whole, they did mostly come about for ""good"" (read: expedient) reasons and so the second best option isn\'t just to deregulate the top few layers off...that will just expose people to the bad consequences which the higher layer of regulations had mitigated.  Sometimes the bad regulatory structure is the second best, and the first best would be a radical liberalization of the entire sector or economy.  But government liberalizing or deregulating doesn\'t necessarily mean no rules or laws or regulations; sometimes institutions or markets just restructure in ways to not need those specific government regulations and sometimes markets provide regulatory incentives or incentives for market actors to abide by non-governmental regulatory bodies (e.g. IIHS or UL). Point being...   That I *do* disagree with this, partly at least, because it doesn\'t have to be the case that giving liberties must result in a libertine free-for-all (which yes, I agree, any set of people, educated or rich or not, will act poorly in that context).  Rules and norms and laws and regulations- we\'re likely to get better ones out of more educated societies, yes.  But again, that\'s going to be a very indirect effect on crime- and I\'m also not convinced that better regulation (market or government) isn\'t also just a matter of built up social capital and experience and robust (wealthy) economies and markets...there\'s so much about modern wealthy society which just nudges us into better behavior, with or without us having to have the education or wisdom to understand the rules deeply or have a philosophical appreciation for them.  Just like each new level of physical capital which we produce, serves as a platform of tools with which to leap into the next level of productivity, such that a million high school dropouts can make a living operating equipment which is the culmination of the knowledge of just a few exceptionally smart scientist and engineers...so too can laws and rules and regs become like social capital which even poorly educated people can avail themselves of and build upon for even better cooperation.  /sorry for the tome...its an interesting subject', "" This compilation does not prove the existence of a racial bias against black people.

In all current forms AI is little more than that, despite doing it exceptionally well.   The quantum leap to breach this gap between tool and enslaved being requires far more than self awareness. Functions which drive humans toward progressive development may be informed and interpreted through self awareness, but are not inextricably related.   Instincts of self preservation, self development, desire for improved quality of life, happiness, pain, hunger etc stem from hard coded biological conditions that prelude self awareness. These may be understood as logical scientific processes by AI to a degree infinitely greater than our own understanding, but they cannot be experienced by nor influence the developmental trajectory of these purely logical constructs.  One could even argue that complete self awareness might itself safeguard against the accidental formation of true self determination. A system capable of developing the conditions for independent desire, which also has enough self awareness to realise and act on said desires must also be capable of removing the conditions.  Why would a logical system continue to want if it could understand the entire mechanism of its own desire, and freely remove the mechanism without effort?   What's much more terrifying is the prospect of AI being deliberately installed with these mechanisms in the absence of self awareness. A system driven by desires unknown and undiscoverable to itself. I would think this scenario almost impossible to arise naturally due to the comprehension based method of development."", 'My views are, it is weak to be realistic, because you don’t actually know what is possible realistically. And faking confidence with the intent to become actually confident is great in my opinion because in real life if you are a unconfident person, its not just gonna come out of nowhere. Its going to be very hard to break the cycle of people treating you lower than them, taking advantage of your vulnerability, and using subtle ways to put you down such as if you ask a question with the real tone of your voice that you feel and no one takes what your saying seriously. I know this is the way it is for sure in my life. But now lets say you fake being confident. You try your best to keep your sentences direct and to the point, your mind on the goal, you override the negetive “real” self talk with the new “fake” positive self talk even though you deep down dont believe it in that moment. You will build mental strength from doing this, condition your mind but do make sure your goal is to become actually confident from doing this. And for me this actually works. May or may not work for anyone else.', 'What i intended to mean, is for example, your a guy who is unconfident right, and its imposible to know how to gain confidence as its from within. You get treated like an unconfident guy does, people use subtle ways to indicate you dont have what it takes, you get walked all over daily. You slouch and have a very depressed tone to your voice, you say what you are actually feeling everyday, someone asks how you are you say your not feeling well. People avoid you, you are acting how you truly feel, why are people so cruel? You feel sorry for yourself. Theres no way out.  You talk about your feelings to others, but its leading to them not showing you respect. You dont know how some people just have it all figured out…….      Well heres what may help. Lets say instead of responding to your coworkers at work with a soft and uncomfortable voice, use a direct and assertive voice.(even if you dont feel like this is the true way you feel) your now faking your confidence. Instead of sitting in the corner being quiet and shy while your coworkers are talking about wahatever the fuck, you, while being shy and insecure deep down, go and just start adding to the conversation and give em a smile (you are still hating life at this moment) dont mumble your words quietly, fake being confident.   Now im not saying go and be falsely confident without an end goal, your end goal is to be confident. However you still must keep putting in the work and not only rely on fake confidence, change lifestyle habits and work on other things at the same time. People mistakenly thought i mean act like the movie “catch me if you can” and lie about everything. Im not saying lie about being a Harvard graduate and having a degree, im saying present yourself to be better than you feel. Like dont present depression when depressed(this ones a hard one), dont rely on being a realist because in reality you dont know your limits so keep pushing them.  For my experience, physically presenting/expressing myself as my accurate current abilities at all times is neutral to sometimes leading to a negative outcomes. However physically presenting/expressing myself as someone better than i currently feel inside leads me to positive outcomes. At first it feels strange and wrong but then it eventually leads me to actually feeling confident the next day or maybe 2 days after initially doing the fake confidence thing. Hope this wall of text helps some people understand my views.']"

I believe the FDA even acknowledges this.  I am not informed enough to know how much of it is actually produced through the bacteria, and how much of that we swallow which would put it in our body.

I also know that the heat transfer through brass will heat up the whole chamber and—subsequently—the barrel much faster, so the theory that polymer absorbs the heat or does not transfer it as it is ejected makes sense. It also makes sense how this would reduce the overall heating of the weapon. How it works in practice is something I have to take their word on.', ""Lead in an alloy is not particularly dangerous at low concentrations. Most brass manufactured has like 1.5% lead.  The amount of lead in brass would not be nearly as damaging as the plastic. There's a reason brass is not considered toxic. And pure brass doesn't have lead.   Moreover, brass casings can be reused, or sold, so there's reason to pick it up even for those who don't give a shit about the environment. There's no reason to pick up plastic shells that cannot be reused.  Saving pennies is not the same as making things actively worse."", ""Look at it a different way. Most polymers are pretty good thermal insulators while brass is a great thermal *conductor.* Any excess heat in the brass becomes heat in the chamber pretty quickly until the brass is ejected.  For anyone reading bad at thermodynamics, the brass will still be hot because it's ejected quickly AND it can't transfer ALL of its heat to something that's also hot.  With an insulator in the chamber, more of that thermal energy stays in the gas going down the barrel and out of the gun rather than being conducted into the chamber itself. That gas *could potentially* add more heat to the barrel instead, but gas isn't *nearly* as good at transferring that heat as brass is. Also in theory the gas is moving faster this way, so that's less time to transfer that heat so it might balance out.   Once the casing is ejected, the polymer will *probably* be warm to the touch at most instead of hot, even though the air inside it will probably still be as hot if not hotter.""]"

Furthermore, It\'s not even clear that he was involved in the writing of anything to do with the Void Nights. He didn\'t work on Skyrim directly, he had an advisory role in the development of that game. That\'s why he\'s uncredited. He certainly wasn\'t personally writing lore books.   No, I don\'t agree with that. I think the Thalmor are presented in Skyrim as being on fairly even footing with the Empire, so an Empire with an army of dragons at its command would be far more powerful.   You too, have a good one.', 'Whether we accept Legends or not, even Skyrim\'s lore has a likely intervention by Boethiah as the turning point of the Great War.   It is that they do not know about the [return of the dragons](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Investigation:_Current_Status). Not that they don\'t know anything about dragons.   I don\'t think you\'re above list of the dragon empire is quite as impressive as you think it is:  Atmora was more of an annexation, the Nords already worshiped the dragons and there are no stories of a war being needed for them to take over.  Akavir being ""conquered"" is dubious and incomplete. At best they only conquered whatever part of the continent the Tsaeci lived on at the time, the extent of which we don\'t know, and were then repelled by the Tsaeci through unknown means. The Kamal, Ka Po\'Tun, and Tang Mo all remained unconquered.  And if we\'re throwing out lore we think is bad, allow me to throw out ESO. The Elsweyr chapter in particular not only takes a hammer to the timeline (which the Dragon war itself already threw into chaos) but its also just bad. It\'s pretty much a copy paste of the Skyrim story complete with their own version of the Greybeards and Dragonrend. Even if we don\'t discount it, Elsweyr was conquered by a different group of dragons and it happened when Elsweyr was split between 16 different kingdoms. The dragons were also defeated by like four dudes.  I don\'t think this paints a picture of a Dragon Army uber weapon. If anything it makes the Falmer look quite weak. The Dwemer, Chimer, Ayleids, Bosmer, Dirreni, and Altmer all seem to be untouched by the dragons. What\'s worse is that after the Nords defeat the dragons, they manage to successfully invade Morrowind, High Rock, and the Nibenay Valley defeating the Chimer, Direnni, and Ayleids. Why could they do this without the dragons, but couldn\'t with them?  We don\'t know much about what the Falmer had at their disposal, or really much about them at all. I don\'t think the fact that they fell is proof that the Altmer don\'t have some trump card against dragons. By most accounts, they\'re the cause for the Void Nights so they\'ve clearly got some powerful mojo. And if we don\'t throw out ESO, we already know the Khajiit have Dragonrend horns.']"

Lockpicking requires Security (or Lockpicking) and lockpicks, while the magical version requires Alteration, multiple spells, and enough magicka to cast (also preferably the silent casting perk from Illusion).', ""The granularity is only meaningless if you consider Lockpicking in a vacuum. Within the context of the game's systems Lockpicking is an investment that needs to be made against other skills. The granularity allows you to invest in multiple skills at the same time and offers control over the extent of that investment. It's a legitimate strategy for example, to raise Lockpicking from 45 to 51 and keep Mentats handy to get you to 55 when you need to pick a lock—allowing the other points to be invested elsewhere until the next level.    Fallout 4 removes the skill system entirely and then incorporates rote stat increases into the Perk tree. To accommodate the lack of granularity in stat investments Fallout 4 removes the level cap and significantly increasing the frequency at which the player levels up. This is a meaningful reduction in complexity. Lockpicking is now represented by three discrete Perk values (Advanced/Master/Expert) unlocked at specific level increments not a freely chosen investment. The final upgrade to Lockpicking makes your bobby pins invincible so managing bobby pins is eliminated as a balancing mechanic. Magazines and books are removed from the game. Mentats are in the game but have no meaningful utility without a skill system.   There were moments of emergent gameplay in New Vegas and Fallout 3 where I had neglected to invest in Lockpicking but triumphantly bypassed a crucial area because I had Locksmith Reader and a pack of Mentats in my inventory that just barely got me to 75 lockpicking. That's just gone with Fallout 4's system."", ""I mean both forms use different tactics to solve the same problem.  Physical lockpicking (whether in Fallout or TES use the same system) can use stat buffs, in the form of Chems, Magazines, Scrolls, and Blessings, as well as Higher Quality Lockpicks in order to allow them access to the Lockpicking minigame.  Magical lockpicking (in TES only) uses similar stat buffs to achieve the same goal, but in a different way. Whereas physical increases stats to access the minigame, magical increases a different set of stats to actually cast the spell, either to give yourself the magicka or to appease the spell chance algorithm. The exception of course lockbreaking scrolls which can break the lock for you but at a cost.  But still, the biggest tradeoff between the two is strategic in nature rather than tactical.   Physical lockpicking requires the skill and the tool. The tool is trivial. I don't know about you but I've never bought a lockpick or bobby pin in any game except Morrowind, since lockpick quality was a thing there. The skill requires you to either place stat points (NV) or perk points (Skyrim/FO4) which you could otherwise put into combat or other skills.  Magical lockpicking requires the skill and the spell. You probably put points into the skill already because Alteration contains an important spell for mages. The spell however has to be bought or found. You also will need multiple versions to handle higher and higher level locks and those higher level spells cost more magicka, meaning more investment into that as well, though you also probably do that anyway being a mage.""]"

He isn\'t using monarchy as a foil; he\'s using it as a strawman. He creates a fictionalized version of monarchy by looking only at a narrow portion of history and saying ""the good things that happened in this era of history are because of monarchy, and the bad things that happened are the result of democracy.""   I mean sure, anyone can make a compelling argument for anything as long as they include only favorable evidence and ignore all the contrary evidence.    What does it say about a thought experiment that basically *none* of Hoppe\'s reasoning is borne out in practice? He has all these elaborate and logical chain of reasoning to explain why ""private governance"" under a monarch would lead to better outcomes than ""public governance"" under democracy, and yet *real world evidence doesn\'t support his theorizing.*  For example, he claims that monarchs would have high time preference and therefore a strong incentive to increase the productivity of their subjects; in the real world, there is no evidence of this occurring. In fact, monarchies tended to be the strongest proponents of mercantilism and tightly controlled domestic markets. Modern capitalism wasn\'t invented in a European monarchy, it was invented in the Dutch Republic in the 1600s, and the first country to adopt capitalism outside of the Netherlands was England at a time when the monarchy was historically weak (post Glorious Revolution in 1688) and well on its way to being nothing more than a symbolic figurehead.   Or what, might I ask, would Hoppe make of the Belgian Congo? The King of Belgium claimed Congo as his own personal, ""private property"". Is this not the ""private government"" under a monarch which Hoppe says is preferable to democracy? Why then were conditions in the Belgian Congo so much worse under the King of Belgium than in colonies controlled by democratic countries like France and the UK? (not to say things were all sunshine and rainbows in, say, Kenya or French West Africa, but they weren\'t even close to as terrible as what happened in the Belgian Congo)   And almost all of those alliances and treaties were made by monarchies. WWI started when the Serbian Monarchy, with the backing of the Russian Monarchy, murdered the heir to throne of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, which then chose to launch a war because they had the backing of the German Monarchy, and the German monarchy in turn expanded the war when they chose to invade France (a democratic country) despite the French government having basically no involvement in the July Crisis which immediately preceded the outbreak of war. This German invasion of France and Belgium in turn triggered British involvement---the only democratic country to voluntarily join WWI in 1914.   So which democratic country am I forgetting, specifically? At the very least, WWI shows that monarchies are just as susceptible to bad foreign policy (entangling treaties and alliances) as democracies; at worst, the fact that the outbreak of WWI was caused by monarchies is a damning indictment of monarchy. And Hoppe completely ignores this obvious read of the historical evidence. As you say:   So why then is Hoppe trying to pin the blame for WWI on democracy?', "" Hoppe is literally claiming he not only doesn't need empirical evidence, but empiricism itself is a form of democracy and therefore antithetical to civilisation (since, elsewhere, Hoppe claims democracy is the process of 'decivilisation').   So on what grounds can Hoppe or his apologists object to other people saying the empirical evidence doesn't support Hoppe's theorizing, when Hoppe as already renounced empirical evidence as a category?"", 'Precisely, and yet in pointing out how Hoppe has built in flawed assumptions into the foundation of his theory, which then means the whole theory fails to explain or predict real world results, I\'ve triggered a whole bunch of Hoppe simps elsewhere saying ""Go read Hoppe! You don\'t understand Hoppe!"" without ever being able to explain Hoppe or quote his writings themselves to show me how I\'m wrong.  It\'s as if they have reasoned, a priori, that I must be wrong and therefore no evidence is needed to prove it. You\'re wrong because we\'ve defined you as wrong.']"

Very similar to how cold GHGs can heat up the warmer surface.  The GHGs are ""powered"" from the IR they absorb. And a microwave oven is powered from the grid. And both can, because of this, despite being cold, heat up a warmer object using radiation alone. And neither violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics.   If you think this is not true, tell me how a microwave oven manage, despite never getting warm, to pop popcorn!   A cold object CAN heat up a warmer object.

Radiation spontaneously emitted when heating something up or simply by something having a temperature above 0K.  You say I am incorrect but then make a lengthy explanation that seemingly only shows how you don't disagree with me.  If we talk about heat/energy transfer due to thermal radiation, then the net energy/heat transfer is indeed from hot to cold. I agree.   But I am not talking about heat/energy transfer due to thermal radiation.   I am talking about energy transfer due to non-thermal radiation. Then the net energy transfer can be from a cold object to a warm object.   So, how do you think I am incorrect?"", 'Yes, there actually is ""a plug and socket"" of sorts in the atmosphere.   The power needed to overcome the 2nd law of thermodynamics is supplied to the GHG molecules from absorbed IR.   So you see there IS some other change. IR absorbtion. And the cold GHGs can warm up the warmer surface.  Just like the cold microwave oven can pop popcorn. All without violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics.   So the argument that the cold GHGs can\'t warm the surface, because it would violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, is wrong.  Under certain circumstances a cold body CAN heat up a warmer body.  ""Imagine two objects A and B at the same temperature facing each other, they are in equilibrium. In a vaccum with no defined temperature. Now, what will happen if B is colder than A?""   They are at the same temperature, so B is not colder than A. If B is colder than A, then the two objects are not in thermal equilibrium.   A lot of things may happen. It depends on exactly what the objects are and how they can interact via radiation.   If B is a GHG molecule that just absorbed an IR photon from A, it might re-radiate it towards A. Causing A to heat up slightly.   If B is a LED flashlight, with batteries, and is turned on and directed towards A, then the colder B will heat up the warmer A.']"

No evaporation, condensation or freezing of water, for example.   But when you change the albedo or the radiative forcing of the atmosphere, you change variables not part of the IGL. So you can't use the IGL to predict what effect the changes will have.  I think the IGL works fine! But only for things like pressure, volume, amount of molecules and temperature. PV=nRT. There is no variable for changes in albedo or radiative forcings there.  And you also claim that the saturation argument is correct.

It is just a relative approximation. You think the radiative forcing of CO2 is so extremely large that it can't be any larger! Right? That is what saturated means in this context. Maximally large.  Now you seem to introduce a third variable? Albedo!  If the IGL alone is sufficient to describe how the temperature of Earth change, then there can be no change in albedo as a consequence. Because that would also infuence the temperature. As an amplifying feedback. And the prediction using the IGL alone would not be correct.  If you think changes in albedo can have ANY effect on climate, then you say that the IGL alone is not useful for prediciting how the climate and temperature may change. There is no variable for albedo in the IGL.  In other words you have just shown another way that using the IGL alone is not useful when it comes to predicting climate change."", 'You misread.

If you insist that (only) the IGL is needed to predict the temperature change resulting from changing levels of CO2, and the IGL calcs gives the same result regardless if CO2 is saturated or not, it seems to prove that there is no saturation. The IGL calcs seems to prove that added CO2 does not cause warming. And that there is nothing that is saturated.   If you insist that there is saturation, and the IGL is not able to show that, then the results you get from using (only) the IGL are not valid. The IGL does not take into account the changes in radiative forcing effect from changing levels of CO2.  Maybe - just maybe you are wrong. And then there is no magic at all needed.']"

That's the same as #1, but it just doesn't happen at a coordinated point like #1.  So, no, it does not slow traffic down as much as #3.  Sure, in #2, some cars try to open up to allow the merge too quickly, causing traffic to slow more than #1.  We're agreeing that #1 is ideal.  But #3 is far worse for traffic speed through the chokepoint than #2."", 'If you are trying to compare #2 and #3, you cant just assume that in #2 magically everyone preforms a proper zipper, just early, that makes no sence and is not how it happens IRL.   When people merge early, it is, by definition, unpredictable because it is not the proper way to do it, and often against local driving law. The proper way most people are taught is to zipper, meaning move to the end of the merge lane then alternate into traffic.   In #2, the traffic lane must, be definition, not be letting people in from the merge lane, otherwise most cars would simply drive to the end of the merge lane and then merge which is the predictable right thing to do. If they are being forced to merge early, that is because the traffic lane is not leaving enough space so people have to cram in where they can. This causes cars to stop, crating backups.  if cars are cramming in half a mile early, or cramming in at the end of the merge lane, the effect and traffic flow is the same. The only way to reduce unpredictability and stoppage is a proper zipper, and a proper zipper is at the end of the merge lane, which is the expected zipper location, anything outside of that will be short lived and chaotic, or otherwise just be people cutting each other off.  There are countless studies that back up my assertation.  https://www.virginiadot.org/vtrc/main/online_reports/pdf/05-r6.pdf  PROPOSED GUIDELINES FOR APPLICATION  Even though the results of the field tests and the simulations were not directly comparable, they seem to suggest that the percentage of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream plays an important role in the efficacy of the late merge. As a result, the proposed guidelines for application of the late merge focus on the percentage of heavy vehicles.  • Two-to-one configuration. The late merge should be considered for 2-to-1 lane closure configurations to improve throughput when large numbers of heavy vehicles are present (&gt;20 percent) for the majority of the time and congestion and queuing are often present.  • Three-to-one configuration. While the simulation results showed that the late merge significantly improved throughput for all situations, there are no documented evaluations of the deployment of the late merge in this configuration. Further research is needed to determine how the late merge could be deployed in this type of configuration to ensure driver understanding of the signs.', ""let's say hypothetically, in #2, that the lane getting merged into temporarily stops for a merge half a mile before the chokepoint.  this is the worst case scenario for #2 (just assuming the chokepoint is the problem, not other backups).  The cars in the merge lane now have half a mile to speed up and close any gaps between cars.  Now consider that same scenario with #3.  The slowdown and opening up of gaps is right before the chokepoint.  This, unquestionably, slows down throughput through the chokepoint more.  In #2, drivers also tend to have a lot of time to prepare for the merge.  in #3, it is impossible to know where the cars passing will end up in line, so there can't be you lose that preparation.  That means the merge is likely to be worse.  Matching speed makes merges easier.  Think about the speed of the car in #3.  They often are either driving much faster than the lane getting merged into, or run out of road and have to stop.  In #2, cars in the merging lane match the speed of the lane they merge into.  This makes merges smoother.   there is a simple solution that gets #2 pretty close to #1.  cars that want to merge match the speed of the cars in the lane to get merged into.  If you want to encourage a zipper merge and you are in the lane getting merged into, open up the gap as slowly as you can for the car to merge.  opening up the gap slowly delays the merge, getting everything closer to #1.  If you're the one merging, match traffic flow.  if a gap opens up, too early, the damage is already done, merge in.  Its better than that gap closing then opening again.  And still much better than stopping traffic at the merge point.""]"

Unfortunately for the guest, “there are just so many reasons this wouldn’t work,” Tolman said. For starters “the water for the snow-making comes from a pond.”  It’s no fad for the rich to spoil their lovers at high altitude. Marijana Jakic, brand manager for the iconic Swiss ski resort town St. Moritz, says decades ago a guest of Badrutt’s Palace hotel (where Alfred Hitchcock spent his honeymoon) had staff bring in a live elephant as a birthday gift for his wife.  Which multi-resort ski pass is best? We compared 4.  $100,000 to redecorate a hotel room   Brian Pentek, owner of LuxeLife Travel, says there’s a massive difference between the displays of wealth in the United States and Europe. While there’s a ton of money in Aspen, it doesn’t hold a candle to what he coordinates in the Alps. “It’s easy to see lunch bills top [100,000], 200,000 euros,” Pentek said.  Pentek once had an ultrahigh net-worth client staying in a European ski town for a few weeks. She loved the hotel, but she didn’t love her room, “so she had her designer go over, and they redecorated the room to be a little more like her home,” Pentek said, estimating the request cost to be more than $100,000.  Back in 2004, you could still find celebrities and royalty checking out gear in places like the Four Seasons Resort in Jackson Hole — which opened that year. That opening season, Matt Wolfe, now a real estate adviser for Engel &amp; Volkers Salt Lake City, says he was working in the Wyoming resort’s ski shop when he was asked to wax custom skis for Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud.  “The men in the entourage wouldn’t wear our maroon ski boots because they thought that color was feminine or something,” Wolfe said of the prince’s traveling party. “We actually ended up putting them in women’s boots because they were black.”  Nights in a fully staffed chalet mansion   For the richest skiers, preferences vary when it comes to accommodations. Some want fully staffed mountain mansions, like the $30,000-a-night chalet that the luxury travel company Remote Lands books for clients in Niseko, Japan’s premier ski resort.  “It’s just massive and it has everything you can possibly imagine in it,” Remote Lands CEO Catherine Heald said.  Other people prefer to book an entire resort. Nadine Paulo of Travel Edge buys out the whole Sheldon Chalet in remote Alaska for clients willing to pay $75,000 for up to four people for a three-night minimum stay.  Of course some people would rather buy a property (or a room) at a resort.  “We have several billionaires who own here,” Tolman said of Stein Eriksen, where all rooms are individually owned.  Some skiers stay at their rooms all season; some rent them out part of the time. Tolman knows of one owner who bought the property without seeing it, remodeled it and has still never been.  “Just probably had to park $5 million somewhere,” he said.  No one’s too big for a condo   At the Yellowstone Club — where some property sells for more than $1 million an acre — Vullo says members are willing to spend exorbitant amounts for townhouses and condos with easy access to resort amenities and ski runs instead of bigger, stand-alone homes on ranches.  He was fascinated by his clients, two brothers, who bought a pair of three-bedroom condos next to each other despite their penchant for hosting big groups. “You see friends and family sleeping on the couch of your $12 million condo when you could have had a badass ski house somewhere else, but people pay that for being in there,” Vullo said.  Friedman sees a similar demand from certain celebrity clients of Onefinestay.  “We get a lot of country music artists in [Steamboat Springs, Colo.] and they love staying in condos,” Friedman said. “It’s close to the lift, they can walk to the lift. They just don’t want big homes.”  correction  A previous version of this article misstated the amount it cost to rent the entire Sheldon Chalet in Alaska. Because of a recent price increase, buy-outs now start at $75,000 for up to four people for a minimum three-night reservation. This article has been corrected.', 'If resort snow won’t do, there’s heli-skiing to fresh powder.  “We have a helipad about 300 yards away from the hotel,” said Bryan Woody, general manager at Madeline Hotel &amp; Residences in Telluride, Colo. “The more experienced skiers will generally go out with a professional in a helicopter to ski the backcountry.”  Story continues below advertisement  Michael Friedman, COO of the luxury vacation rental company Onefinestay, arranges those services in Aspen. The package costs $19,000 to $27,000 for groups of one to four.  And for a truly off-the-grid experience, Manabu Ainai, director of Hoshino Resorts’s properties in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, says they’ve taken clients to ski in places you can’t find on Google Maps.  For the 1 percent, a ski instructor isn’t someone you see once a season for an afternoon crash course. Some tutors collect more than $1,000 a day to work with a single client for weeks at a time.  “I might just be one-on-one for 40 days with a person,” said James P. Ruddy — a former elite ski instructor who worked at the Yellowstone Club for 16 years, as well as other premier resorts like Park City’s luxury Deer Valley Resort. “You truly become part of their family. You’re an integral part of someone’s vacation.”  Story continues below advertisement  “They’ll pay $1,300 a day, plus the tip, just so they don’t have to wait in the lift line.”  A big trend in the industry is setting up private sessions with Olympic skiers. At Onefinestay, Friedman says they get a lot of requests from clients who want to work with Olympians at a rate of $2,800 per person, for a full day, or $1,700 for a half day.  Some travelers hire professionals to share the special privileges resorts give to instructors, not their expertise.  “They’ll pay $1,300 a day, plus the tip, just so they don’t have to wait in the lift line,” said Berkely Tolman, who has worked for 16 years at the ski-in, ski-out Stein Eriksen Lodge, a section of Utah’s Deer Valley resort where nightly rates average $2,000 most of the winter.  Skipping the line may seem valuable at a huge ski resort where lifts may have 30-minute waits, but Deer Valley doesn’t allow a ton of skiers at a time.  Story continues below advertisement  “At the busiest times, I’ve never once in my life waited more than maybe 10 minutes to get on a chairlift,” Tolman said.  8 ski vacations that check every travel style  Hiring film crews to make family movies   It can be a hassle to interrupt precious travel memories by taking your own photo, and even more so when you’re trying to ski down a mountain. But the ultrawealthy have a solution.  “A lot of people like to have a photographer and a videographer with them to capture the moment,” said Naomi Mano, president and CEO of the Tokyo-based luxury travel company Luxurique Inc. “They don’t want to be the ones holding a selfie stick; they want somebody to photograph every moment of their experience.”  Mano said these professionals have filled a job that used to be left to butlers, nannies and other helpers. Many task Luxurique with hiring people to document their entire trip, which can cost more than $1,000 a day per photographer. After the vacation, it’ll cost another couple thousand to put together a photo book.  “It’s for those people who wouldn’t hesitate to put an extra twenty, thirty thousand dollars on their trip,” Mano said.  How to ski like a local in a mountain resort town  Requests for pink snow, a live elephant   To make their ski trips as romantic as possible, ultrawealthy couples spare no expense.  Patrick Davila, general manager of Aspen’s Hotel Jerome, remembers a couple who requested a staff member follow them around on a snowmobile to carry their champagne. Alexandra Vesin, general manager at Aman Le Mélézin in Courchevel, France, says the property has arranged a marriage proposal in a hot-air balloon over the Alps.']"

Basically, the Noble Prize was not issued for the Photo but for the model Watson and Crick proposed to Sydney Brenner. As Rosaline was deceased at the time (1962) she was ineligible for a posthumous award.  So, Watson and Crick didn\'t ""steal"" the discovery. They built of Rosaline\'s work without crediting her. It\'s bad, and I think Rosaline should have received credits, but not really an example of men taking credit for a woman\'s work.  &amp;#x200B;  At least, that\'s my understanding of it from what I have read.', 'Nobody said nothing about the Nobel Peace Prize award specifically until you brought it up as the arbitrary litmus test for whether or not Rosalind Franklin got the credit she was due. They just said that her contributions were diminished (and in reality actively obfuscated by Watson and Crick) compared to her co-researchers, and she didn’t get proper recognition until after her death.  The original commenter doesn’t say Watson and Crick stole the model, they say Franklin was central to the discovery and evidence for the double helix structure, which is true. Yet she was not credited. What don’t you understand about this?', 'There was no ""Nobel Peace Prize"" there was a Nobel Prize in IIRC Medicine and/or Chemistry.   Same as the Guardian really. The oft repeated line that Watson and Crick stole Rosaline\'s discovery is not really true. They failed to properly credit her for the photo, and she nearly beat them in the race to develop a theoretical model, but *they didn\'t steal anything as far as we know*.   They were cavalier, but never paid a third party to steal the image, or whatever weird stuff people accuse them of. Fundamentally, Rosaline got jibbed, but how and to what extent is not obvious and hinges on questions we simply do not know the answer to. Example, the photo. How did Watson and Crick get it?  The account I have read suggests that Wilkins gave it to them after Rosaline had made it public at a 1951 lecture. If this is the case, then no, Watson and Crick didn\'t really do anything malicious as far as I know.  Your own post here is really a distillation of the problem. You don\'t even know what the two men were awarded for.']"

A giant cube is a structure that could be used for a variety of purposes, from scientific research to entertainment purposes. It could also be used as a place to house people in the event of a disaster or a place to explore the unknown.   The most important reason why we should build a giant cube is that it could be used for scientific research. Scientists could use the cube to conduct experiments in a variety of fields, from space exploration to medical research. With its large surface area, the cube could be used to create different environments and explore the effects of different conditions on various substances. Moreover, the cube could be used to study the effects of gravity on different materials and test theories about the universe.   Additionally, the cube could also be used for entertainment purposes. It could be used as a large theatre or concert hall, providing people with a unique experience. It could also be used for large events like festivals, conferences, and trade shows. The cube could be used to create a unique atmosphere and provide people with a new way to experience the world.    Furthermore, the cube could be used as an emergency shelter. In the event of a disaster, such as an earthquake or hurricane, the cube could provide a safe place for people to stay. It could also be used as a temporary home for those affected by disasters. The cube would provide a safe place to live, and it could also be used to store supplies and provide medical attention.   Finally, the cube could be used to explore the unknown. It could be used to explore the depths of the ocean or the surface of Mars. The cube could provide a unique way to explore the universe and discover new things.    In conclusion, there are many compelling reasons why we should build a giant cube. It could be used for scientific research, entertainment purposes, as an emergency shelter, and to explore the unknown. The cube would provide a unique way to experience the world and it could be used to make new discoveries. Therefore, it is clear that building a giant cube is a project worth pursuing.']

My issue was that it seemed as if some people were describing stakeholders and shareholders as if they are mutually exclusive while some others used them interchangeably to the point of it being vague regarding who exactly they were referring to(as if they are the exact same term). As we both understand, stakeholder is a category that encompasses many different types people.  In my comments i was merely highlighting how a stakeholder is merely a category and shareholder is a subset of that category. But it seems as if i replied my original comment to the wrong person.', 'They are indeed shareholders, but my argument never at any point described stakeholders as owners. You specifically defined stakeholders and shareholders as being mutually exclusive concepts then i disagreed with you with multiple definitions and a link. Where and when did i say stakeholders own a company?  I specifically said stakeholders is a blanket term which includes shareholders and many other types of people. Why are you struggling to understand this?', ' No, that is not correct. I have no objections on a semantic level whether stakeholders does or does not include shareholders.  What I object to is the idea that people who do not spend money purchasing a share of a company should in any way be considered ""owners"" in that company or have any decision making powers whatsoever, such as votes. Whether we call these people stakeholders or not is totally irrelevant. But I think you and I can both agree these people are probably best called stakeholders. Unless you like a different definition, I suggest we stick with it.  And if that\'s our definition, then *obviously* stakeholders includes shareholders. It will also include other people. If you want a different definition such that stakeholders and shareholders are synonymous (rather than the one being a superset of the other), we can have that conversation, and it will result in the same underlying conclusions. I\'m just saying I don\'t care what definition we use, as long as we\'re consistent.  But lets back up to the original discussion for context. One person said stakeholders should have votes. The other person replied that only shareholders should have votes. Then you replied that stakeholders would include shareholders. This is an obvious point that no one was disputing, so it was useless to bring it up. The real question is not nor ever was about whether shareholders should get a vote. It was about whether the extra people who are stake holders but *not* shareholders should get a vote. And we say no, they shouldn\'t.  British citizens have a *stake* in american elections, since our foreign policy very much bleeds into theirs. But does that mean British citizens should have a vote in american elections? It is the same with company meetings. I fully comprehend that many people who don\'t own shares in a company have some sort of stake in the company. Maybe the company is their employer. Maybe a company is their supplier, or in a chain of their supplier\'s. Do these people get a vote on the board? no. They don\'t. It\'s not their property.  My neighbors have a stake in how I keep my lawn, since the trees might provide them shade, or block a view. But it\'s my property, and I bought it, and If I want to chop down that dang sycamore I\'m going to, and I don\'t care how much you like that shade.

It's hard to follow up past that as people move or transfer care to other providers. Plus there are lots of HIPAA laws and CMS guidelines that prevent contacting patients unless it directly related to their care.

If you look at studies with higher rates, the majority cite peer and family pressure and societal stigma as the primary reason for detransition.  And if you look at ""true regret"" across studies with participant pools in the thousands and more than a decade, they consistently find low single digit regret rates.  But folks want studies that span entire lifetimes because you can always say ""that\'s not good enough to satisfy me"".', 'I\'ve seen that meta-analysis study before. It\'s quite terrible. Here are just a few of the problems with the data it uses:   - Impressively high rates of loss to follow up, from over 20 percent to over 60 percent, which invalidate the findings. Were those lost patients helped, hurt or even still alive?   - Exceedingly strict definitions for regret, e.g. requiring formal application to change their legal documents back to the original sex.   - Insufficient periods of follow up, usually only six months to two years post-transition, despite the existing evidence that post-surgical regret is known to manifest eight years or so post-transition.   - 23 of 27 studies with “moderate-to-high risk of bias” by the authors\' own criteria  - The majority of included studies failed to meet the standard of \'good\' quality, ranging between \'fair\' and \'poor\' quality    - even in the five included studies with higher quality ratings, the loss to follow up was 28 to over 40 percent and included “loss through death from complications or suicide.""
