Just do what we do to pay for K-12, but do it with college. Why are you saying it's impossible when we literally do it for K-12?   Yeah, and? Taxes pay for K-12 as well. Your point?   So that they can send their kids to college without having to pay for it independently out of pocket. Instead it gets paid for through taxes. I suggest taxes on the rich, that way even middle class families won't have to pay a dime for it.  You know, people in this country used to work and fight for the next generation to have it better than they did. Free higher education would make it better for the future than we have it right now. Why do you fight so vehemently against a good thing?"", 'Yeah I really don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre condescending or sarcastic. I mostly found it amusing you‚Äôre telling me to do more research and that I‚Äôm not listening, when you don‚Äôt understand the legal system as well as you think you do.   Let‚Äôs try this one more time. The 6th circuit case you keep citing was regarding one specific rally, in which Trump never uttered any phrases which could be construed as encouraging violence. He also mentioned to his crowd to not hurt the protestors. These two factors led the appellate court to strike down the lawsuit.   January 6th and other rallies are entirely different because he *did* utter phrases which can be construed as inciting violence. His usage of the term ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù could very well be mitigating, but that‚Äôs for a jury to decide. The 6th circuit case in no way is precedent that he can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt be charged, as you keep saying.   If you want case law that is directly relevant to Jan. 6th, try this on for size. A federal judge earlier this year rejected Trump‚Äôs efforts to dismiss a lawsuit, saying the court believes Trumps speech that day was not necessarily protected by the first amendment, because it incited violence.   https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-lawsuits-donald-trump-48fef5775a0043339fb38aa84ad419be  That ruling is currently being appealed to the DC circuit, but there‚Äôs a gem in there as well. The Trump lawyer recently told one of the appellate judges that civil suites should be barred because it sets a bad precedent for future presidents, but admitted that ‚ÄúTrump could theoretically face criminal liability over the riots.‚Äù Which is another good point: there are legal differences in civil cases, like the one you keep citing, and criminal ones. But his own lawyer admitted he could face criminal liability.   Trumps other statements that day behind closed doors are highly relevant. In order to prove incitement, prosecutors need to show intent. If you listen to Trumps statements throughout the day, it can be dismissed as Trump being Trump. On the other hand, his actions behind closed doors add context to his state of mind, and you‚Äôre flat out wrong if you think they‚Äôre not relevant to a charge of incitement or conspiracy.   I honestly couldn‚Äôt care less about the house impeachment managers editing a video. Impeachment is a political process, not a criminal one. And if that video was shown in criminal court, you don‚Äôt seem to understand how exculpatory evidence works anyways. The Brady rule only requires that the government hand over evidence that could show a defendants innocence, not that they themselves have to show it in court.  If Trump is ever indicted on incitement and/or conspiracy charges, prosecutors can use videos of his statements that day without mentioning his peaceful claim. Maybe they would to preempt the defenses argument, but prosecutors don‚Äôt play the role of defense attorneys‚Ä¶  I‚Äôm well aware that people are fanatical in their wish to see Trump go to prison. But it‚Äôs up to DOJ, not two people on Reddit who don‚Äôt have law degrees.', "" Please make your argument. How did the author define a healthy marriage. What characteristics? What are your reasons to believe that women seeking abortions and their sex partners share those characteristics?  I need a citation that in the referenced studies that the parents who were married wanted to be married to each other. It is your claim, so you can define what that means? Wanted to be married on the day they were married? 50 years of uninterrupted marital bliss? Whatever it is, please provide your citation that in the studies that demonstrated that children of married bioparents do better that the bioparents wanted to be married.    You mean all other things being equal. Actually, I am getting confused by your argument. Are you arguing that the children of a single woman who got married and got a marriage payment would not be better off if she got married and didn't get the marriage payment. Or are you arguing that the children of the woman would be better off if she got the payments even if she was married?   Sorry, typo. I meant to say: You seem to think single parents can't just go marry the other parent.    Because the data show this is less than ideal for the average child. If I am going to make these levels of changes to society, I really want to aim for the best possible situation.    I mean, how often do you think that happens? Laws don't exist to make sure that every possible thing in your life is already laid out for you, including everything that is highly unlikely to happen. People have to live their own lives. If some rare exceptional thing happens, you may be faced with rare exceptional choices. But for the hundreds of millions of other people, the law can provide some practical, broad support.    I don't want to incentivize gestation. I want all parties to get what they want. PL - no abortions. PC - more choices. Society - more and better citizens.  Society is not satisfied with women gestating and then abandoning children in garbage cans.    What are you talking about? Can you show me any US state marriage law that requires people certify they love each other? Are you serious with this?   Look, if you want to look for creative solutions, you cannot have such an inside the box attitude.    I think you will not get society on board. Paying women to give birth but having no expectations on what happens to the child after that. Perhaps all the claims of PCs about PLs not caring what happens to kids once they are born is just projection.    This is just discrimination. You can hire the best person for a job. The data show married bioparents are the best parents for kids.    Except marriage ties together two people's financial situations. The man is incentivized to marry the woman, as they now both have claims to the payments.    I already said either way. Are you in with no abortion restrictions? It seems like no.    Good thing this never happens, even if everyone is trying to get there.    The problem with this suggestion is why should I do it? Tell me why I should give money to a woman just because she gave birth. That seems like a horrible idea. Women would literally give birth, get the check, and throw the baby in the trash and get pregnant again. I am not paying for that.    Tell you what. If you want this, lets go to the mods and ask for a rule that anything that happens after birth is off limits on this sub. No more PCs saying that PLs don't care what happens after birth, because it is not about abortion and banned. Or is this a silly thing to say? I hope my point is getting clearer.""]"

There\'s strategy, planning, choices, proficiencies, flaws, etc. and you set up and play the game you can--but, there\'s an ocean of chaos and randomness in it.  It\'s spinning plates and juggling risk.  Clinton didn\'t lose /because/ some single thing was done wrong or went bad--as people claim she shoulda woulda coulda campaigned elsewhere, differently, etc. or heeded this or that polling or advice or ritual or tradition or habit or strategy.  Clinton lost because there is or was no more reviled human being in high politics than Hillary Clinton except, maybe, George W. Bush. And that rage and hate and dislike was built carefully, over time and since the 90\'s when people saw that she had ambitions greater than being Barbara Bush or Nancy Reagan and qualifications to back it.  They knew the first woman President had a high likelihood of being Hillary Clinton since the late 90\'s. Very high. And that the Democrats would come together like a leviathan with the Bill Clinton inroads to all sorts of traditionally difficult communities to attract and so much money it would sicken everyone. They knew the moment she announced, more than half the nation (way more) would leap to the historic moment.  And then she became the junior Senator from New York and showed she was a policy wonk and real player and they shit themselves harder.  And they breathed a tiny sigh of relief that she might get backseated by a black man--maybe the only thing that could have done it.  And then she became a devastatingly capable Secretary of State.  And they were going to have to deal with one of the most qualified human beings to ever run for the office of President.  With money.  With history.  With acumen. With allies.  And the right... in the 90\'s... in the 00\'s... in the 10\'s... Fox and Breitbart and Townhall and Rush and Hannity and every talking head they have and old white men with lots of money and reeling from a shellacking (twice) by that black man (the junior of the two, widely regarded as the less scary of the two for the right) who managed to break the gridlock of health care in the US wide open and recapture the pop culture imagination of a nation that hadn\'t had that since Bill--the GOP being notoriously shit at doing that, last time being Reagan in the mid-80\'s...  ...all those c\\*\\*ts...  ...at every stage of that narrative...  ...from Bill\'s terms in office...  ...through Bush...  ...through Obama...  ...they have spent fortunes in political and real capital and endless hours of footage and recording and events and ads and hearings trying, desperately, to invent a version of Hillary Clinton that would turn off that 10% of the nation that might still be open to shitting on her.  Because she\'s old.  Because she\'s shrill. Because she\'s a bigot.  Because she\'s ""elite"".  Because she\'s a liar.  Because she\'s a criminal.  Because she\'s not the traditional picture of a President.  (all things Mr. Trump is)  AND because she left Americans to die. And because there are conflicts in the world that have gone poorly. And because she\'s a woman. And because she\'s ""establishment"".  And most of the nation looked at these caricatures and ignored them--because they\'re obvious.  And some of those 10% believed them.  One of the strands of spaghetti on the wall.  I believe, personally and that\'s worth nothing (I accept and even agree), that perhaps the most qualified person to be the American President in my lifetime was either Hillary Clinton or George H.W. Bush.  On sheer experience and paper.  I also believe a Clinton Presidency would have brought about a conflict with Russia and expanded and strengthened NATO--and then a victory in that conflict. Likely in Ukraine. I believe the ACA would have been given fresh legs and cleaner and more expanded access--continuing to move the needle on how many Americans are insured from Obama\'s years. I believe her administration would recognize the need to reinvent the Democratic Party after their wins into a 21st century party long and truly well ahead of the right by many years and the result of that would have been voting rights and family-friendly policies (more tax breaks for ""families""--an ugh for me, not having kids, but ok and it plays well with middle American; family leave--same); equal pay--not impacting me, likely; some kind of public college support--not impacting me; and an infrastructure bill that would make the early 20th century blush.  And the right would have lost their collective minds, but continued the ""soul searching"" they started with Obama and continued when he won re-election. We might have a more calcified ""Tea Party"", but I think we\'d have seen a quicker move from the young Republicans (who want a career and future for themselves, too, and will long outlive the relics in charge) to swallow more libertarian pills to avoid the 20th century culture wars and their empty value.  Young men touting Rogan rather than Rush. All opposing the anti-Thatcher (in their eyes) and her matronly old grip on power.  Cilnton was done dirty.  I say this as someone who was not excited about a Clinton Presidency and someone who recognizes the Clinton machine for it\'s abuses and sins.  She was done dirty.  But, credit to the old girl (with utmost respect), it took an army whole decades to bring that woman down. From a strategic point of view?

There are also like maybe a hundred meta-anarchists in the world, so that\'s an extremely unfair determination of what we do. Likewise, if someone you met *was* a Christian Anarchist, they wouldn\'t necessarily tell you, because a lot of Anarchists have the same attitude as you toward them, and they\'re likely sick of defending themselves repeatedly. Same with other minority Anarchist positions. They\'re not necessarily going to reveal this, if they\'re sick of answering the same questions again and again. I\'ve never met a tankie in real life, but I know they exist out in the world, some of them agitating for their own beliefs.         Sadly, no. There are a lot of single-flavor Anarchists who want their favorite specific Anarchist system to be the only one. I mostly see this with AnComs, but I\'ve seen other Anarchists do it too. Anarchists are not exempt from petty infighting about which Anarchist system is ""reaaaaally"" Anarchist. Meta-Anarchism is, currently, a fringe position within Anarchism. Related things like Anarchism-without-adjectives are also trying to cut through the infighting, but when you get down to brass tacks with some of them, they also have a favorite Anarchist flavor that they hope is ""the"" outcome of revolution, as though there can be only a single system that results.         Eh. Political action is organized on the basis of political ideology, and political ideology comes from the juxtaposition of idealized systems (political philosophy, including that of Anarchists) and reality. So an Anarchist essayist composing a work outlining a new flavor of Anarchism (say, meta-anarchism) is contributing to Anarchism in a different way.      I find it funny that many of us will reference Marx, who only wrote and spoke about his ideas, then turn around and call any Anarchist thinker who isn\'t going out and doing Anarchist praxis an ""armchair Anarchist."" There\'s no such thing as an ""armchair Anarchist,"" besides perhaps someone who secretly believes in Anarchism, but never tells anyone anywhere, and does nothing on this basis, even private, individual praxis. If you do absolutely anything with Anarchism, including just telling people you are, then you are doing Anarchism, because that builds awareness of Anarchism, the ideology. One person who tells each of their friends or coworkers or whoever about Anarchism might create three people going out and doing other Anarchist praxis who otherwise might never have arrived at that.']"

But let\'s address it.  Half of her response boils down to ""sex causes problems"" which is true. You don\'t need to be in sex work to have these issues, simply having sex all the time leads to the same issues.   Next, sex workers have a higher chance of being raped, murdered, or assaulted. Guess what, it is a cash business. Several studies show that retail workers and those who work with cash also have a higher chance of being raped, murdered, or assaulted. Now She does address this, but when you look at her research a lot of it comes back to one particular study performed against police data in one city over a 32-year period. On top of that, the conclusions of the study attribute a lot of the deaths to drug use, and sharing needles. They also acknowledge that are other factors that include being unable to obtain benefits, and difficulty in getting legal employment. The sex workers who end up murdered are difficult to investigate because few will turn to the police because prostitution is illegal.   She does make a great argument about mental health issues why people end up as prostitutes, and what the long-term effects of prostitution are. I\'m not going to disagree with her point here.    But again, these are cyclical in nature, when you have an inherent distrust in law enforcement because of your profession when you don\'t have access to health benefits, and when you\'re in a society with shit mental health services... they all compound the issue. Normalizing sex work shines a light on the issue, it allows you to build a support system that can support the more vulnerable. When you don\'t have other services to go to, you\'re at the behest of your employer or in this case, your trafficker for everything. Very similar to abuse with H1-B visa workers in the united states.   Hell, there is research out there that shows that state-sponsored foreign aid also increases human trafficking. There is ample research to show that the more democratic a country is, the higher the inflows for human trafficking to those countries are, regardless of whether sex work is legal. You\'ll also have more liberal sex worker laws in these more democratic countries. There is a correlation != causation thing here that has to be accounted for, and going through the papers on the subject, none of them seem to address the why when accounting for the other variables.   On the whole, sex work is illegal in a majority of countries, and listing a handful of countries where it is, does not detract from that point.  You can make an argument about how dangerous it is for women to be seen as sexual objects, and you\'re right it is. How do you address the fact that the sexualization of humans happens regardless of what their biological sex is?   There can be good in controlling the sexual narrative around you as a person. You can\'t control that narrative when it comes to society as a whole, but you absolutely can control your own narrative.', 'Still there‚Äôs no reason for prostitution to not be legal', ""Legalized sex work increases trafficking, that was my point. So no, you can't just have sex work without trafficking. Some individual sex workers are not trafficked, but so what? Does that matter when there are so many who are?""]"

How did Ukraine fuck with Russia before the start of the war?', ""1. It's a sovereign nation, a Democracy, and deserves self determination. If we let this happen to Ukraine it means no country is safe, especially those around Russia. We can't have a modern precedent that nations can just go in and take over other nations (especially those who aren't in NATO) or the world will devolve into the brutal imperialism that marred the past couple thousand years and has claimed hundreds of millions of lives.  2. Russia is genociding Ukrainians, torturing them, raping kids, kidnapping kids for God knows what - we can't in good conscience allow such brutality. To stand by and do nothing is to tacitly condone brutal genocide. Helping Ukraine is the morally right thing to do.    3. Ukraine has historic ties with European and NATO counties in the region and is a potential strong ally as well as has close cultural ties to many US allies, and allies stick together. Ukraine has been working towards joining the European Union and while it wasn't really a contender for NATO membership (because of occupied Crimea among other reasons) it was becoming a strong ally to European nations which are our allies, and allies work together. Helping Ukraine helps keep our allies safe and keeping our allies safe keeps us from having to go to war and send American soldiers to defend our military allies.   4. Ukraine is very resource rich and is called the Bread Basket of Europe. Protecting those resources is important to the global supply chain. People are literally going to starve to death especially in Africa because of the disruption in Ukraine's wheat supplies.  5. Ukraine has huge reserves of natural gas and oil. Ukraine could help reduce global reliance on countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia and is conveniently located to supply those resources to Europe.  6. Ukraine is the largest country in Europe (discounting Russia, which is largely in Asia anyway) and has a vital strategic location between European Democracies, fascist Russia, and developing nations like Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Iraq (and the Middle East in general) as well as strategically important coastline on the Black Sea. While Ukraine isn't eligible for NATO membership it's still an important buffer between NATO and Russia that made direct conflicts (and therefore WWIII) less likely.   7. Russia is anti-West, anti-America, anti-Democracy, and anti-non-Russians and we have to take a stand against their imperialist machinations or the entire region is in danger and Russia gets a toehold further into the heart of Europe, putting our allies in danger. We would also lose our buffer zone.   8. Ukraine has exposed Russia's army - which used to be considered the second best in the world - as a paper tiger. For a little bit of money (relative to the US budget) and some junky old equipment Ukraine is demolishing one of our greatest enemy's armies without the loss of a single American soldier. Militarily speaking it's the bargain of the century.  9. It's no secret Putin wants to recreate the old borders of the Russian Empire/Soviet Union and stopping them in Ukraine prevents the conflict from spilling out all over the region. If Russia captures Ukraine nobody knows where Putin would stop in his conquests. Ukraine is really taking a bullet for the entire region.   10. It's the right thing to do. And hopefully that still counts for something in people's minds."", ' I\'m quoting this part of your response because it is the fundamental untruth at the heart of your argument. The current war in Ukraine did not start in 2022 with the Russian invasion. It started in 2014 with the US backed coup. Those events triggered an ongoing civil war in Ukraine that has continued to the present day.  I don\'t condone the Russian invasion, but you are intentionally ""forgetting"" the historical context which led up to it and the continiung situation of the pro-Russian population in the east of Ukraine who were being shelled by Ukrainian forces during 8 years of civil war.  In 1982, my country (the UK) went to war in the Falklands to defend the disputed Falkland islands over which Argentina claimed sovereignty. Though the Falklands are close to Argentina and far from Britain, and most British people to this day know next to nothing about the islands or the people who live there, the war was fought to defend the population who identifed as British. I am not old enough to have any personal understanding of that piece of British history, nor do I feel qualified to have an opinion on that war. But I do know that the UK presented itself as defending people who were British and wanted to be British.  There is a double standard in the West. In every war, our countries present themselves as liberators and defenders. Yet according to the West, Russia has no equivalent right to defend the ethnic Russian, Russian speaking population in Ukraine from a regime that has been shelling them for 8 years.  When Crimea voted to return to Russia, the West acted as though Russia had illegitimately ""annexed"" Crimea, ignoring the fact that historically Crimea was a part of Russia until it was gifted to Ukraine by the USSR in 1954. The people of Crimea identified as Russian yet the popular vote to return to Russia was dismissed by the West and treated as a sham.  Likewise the referenda in Donbass and Luhansk have been portrayed as illegitimate by the West.  It\'s all so political and one-sided. It saddens me that my own country applies these double standards.  If Russia had adopted the Western playbook for war narratives,  it would have simply announced that it is liberating the people of eastern Ukraine. I believe that Russians and the people in the parts of Ukraine that voted to join with Russia do see it that way. The Minsk  accords were broken and the West encouraged that situation, rather than supporting peace and insisting that Ukraine abide by the terms of the agreement. From Russia\'s point of view, the current war is both a humanitarian action to protect a part of the population of Ukraine which identifies as Russian, and a necessary strategic action  in defence of its own borders due to increasing NATO encroachment and interference in Russia\'s nearest neighbourhood.  How many times have NATO countries portrayed their invasions of other sovereign nations as ""liberations"" rather than invasions? I remember watching the BBC news when they announced the ""liberation"" of Iraq. That was a war we now know to have been fought on an entirely fabricated pretext. A million Iraqis were killed.  I have written above about the Russian perspective on the current war in Ukraine. That is not to say that I simply accept it, anymore than I would unquestioningly accept the war narratives of any country, including my country or yours, both of which have made war under false pretences multiple times in recent history. Truth, as the saying goes, is a casualty of war. When you look for truth in war narratives, the thing you find has broken bones.  I don\'t accept the western narrative of the war in Ukraine because it says untruthfully that history started in February of 2022. Out of the blue, for some unknown reason - perhaps a whim of Putin\'s, or a symptom of his madness  - Russia initiated an ""unprovoked"" invasion of Ukraine. That is the western narrative, in which the USA conveniently ""forgets"" its own role  in the 2014 coup. Where the western media forget its own reports from as recently as a few years or months before February of 2022, about the growing threat of nazi militias and extreme far-right nationalism in Ukraine, about corruption in that country and anti-democratic measures from its government. Everything before 2022 is erased. Suddenly Ukraine is a paragon of democracy, led by a saint in a green t-shirt, invaded by a cartoon villain for the lulz.  No. That\'s not how things are, nor how they came to be as now they are.  I believe that Russia puts out propaganda, sure it does. And so does America. And so does the UK.  Because I\'m British, it is British lies that bother me the most. All countries lie in war. But I want my country to do better than that. I would hope you would want a more truthful America too. Otherwise what are we, but willfully ignorant tribes, insisting on the supremacy of our way over all the other ways... for no other reason than because we can, because we want our tribe to win and  be the best, the most *righteous* tribe - with the truest Truth against the rottenest of enemies - without actually earning any of it, without caring whether or not our story is *actually* true, or looking for a solution that would work for the other tribes also, so that peace would be possible?']"

Does the older have a pattern of sexually pursuing very young adults? If so, why? Would they go younger if it were legal?"", "" I think you're seeing this backward. The actual age gap isn't the issue.  If a 75-year-old dates a 50-year-old, most people don't care‚Äîstill a 25-year age gap but in much closer stages of life.  But when you're a 50 year which dates a 25 year (especially if you show a pattern of doing it), it begs the question, why? Assuming you aren't just hooking up with the other person, why do you want to be in a relationship with someone you probably have little in common with?  Are you super immature?  Or is it more nefarious because you know you can use the age gap to manipulate the other person in many ways? Even if you're intentions are good large age-gap relationships can lead serious issues, with one person taking advantage of the other. The age gap is an indicator the relationship may be unhealthy. It doesn't automatically mean it is, but it's a pretty good indicator, especially if the younger person is in their teen or early twenties.   I'm a gay woman getting close to middle age. Do I find women in their 20s objectively attractive? Sure. Would I date one? No. Because I would like to have something in common with my partner. I would like them to be at a similar stage in life, both emotionally and career-wise. And yeah, I'm going to side-eye most people (regardless of gender) who date people much younger than them. Especially if they actively seek out those relationships because it means there's a particular reason they want someone much younger. And almost none of those reasons are wholesome.   Yes, there are many ways people can be abusive in relationships.  Did someone imply that non-age gap relationships were always rainbows and butterflies? But would you deny it's easier when one partner has been making money for an extra 25 years for financial abuse to occur?"", "" I'm not. I'm pointing out the very valid concerns people have regarding age gap relationships. Again, I literally said that there's nothing inherently wrong with age gap relationships, and that the nature of the relationship is dependent on someone's motives.   Does the older have a pattern of sexually pursuing very young adults? If so, why? Would they go younger if it were legal?   Agai,n while there are exceptions, it's not a little-known fact that age gap relationships tend to be unsuccessful, for a multitude of reasons.   Possibly, it's still not the majority. Many people seem to forget that these older women (and men) who dislike age gap relationships are parents, and simply don't want their kids being taken taken advantage of by older adults.""]"

The older 1600s text changes the wording a bit to try to ‚Äúcapture‚Äù the original meaning without interpreting it literally, which is quite literally the same way the Great Bible was translated from the very same texts the KJV was translated from originally.   This tells me that the Great Bible is roughly equivalent to the original KJV and the Young‚Äôs Literal Translation is roughly equivalent to the currently authorized version of the KJV still recognized as such in Britain.

What I‚Äôve been saying this whole time, more or less, is that you have no reason to limit yourself strictly to a 1611 text nobody even uses anymore when a lot of these others capture the original meaning of the text a lot better. Even the New King James Version does better at this than the original KJV.

This isn\'t void in the government, which is why lobbying exists, but it\'s less of an issue. Or at least when it is an issue it\'s a smoother graph. Government programs for the homeless are not *only* for select cities. They tend to be province wide.  So in short, I\'m all in favor of those private entities doing everything they can, just that I\'m not convinced they alone can ever be enough due to the demons of human nature.  Government is run by humans, so is corruptible too. But it\'s *possible* to put in really robust systems and transparencies to keep them somewhat on task and they have greater reach.  For things that I think are fundamental to human wellbeing such as food, water, shelter, education, and healthcare this is where I think the government\'s reach is highly valuable.  We already compel some things through the government, and I see no distinction between public defenders, public educators, and public doctors.  I will never say charity is a bad thing in general. I think there are bad charities - I\'ll never give to the Salvation Army because they actively fight LGBT+ assistance. But in making that choice I am now causing someone else who\'s only able to benefit from that church to get less. Because populations are asymmetrical, so too will be the things we donate to.  A government is supposed to put in hospitals and schools etc. when there\'s a need, regardless of what the people think. It\'s imperfect, but I think a better solution *in general* to these issues.  But in tandem they do even more. There are people wealthy enough to afford taxes AND donate. Were I wealthy enough I\'d be doing so. If I won the lottery I\'d be setting up programs to help LGBT+ and homeless people find safe homes, medical assistance, counseling, and jobs. I\'d also pay my taxes. But I can\'t because I don\'t have much money. Academia has money in it, but I burnt out and I\'d end up on a rope if I stuck in it too long so I sacrificed the money for something I can live with.   And this is another issue. That charity idea is pretty narrow. A lot of charities are people\'s pet projects. 1/4 of charity money in the US is for religious causes. What that means is unclear, but I grew up religious and the food bank we ran got less money than the neighboring church spent on ""charity concerts"" which raised money to host more concerts so they could expand the building and add a gym...some of these ""pet projects"" are undoubtedly less valuable to society than others, but get masked.   I don\'t like America\'s extreme disdain for even the hint of collectivism. I don\'t want a communist state, but I don\'t think it\'s either or. I think it\'s possible to have some amount of ""hey, we live in a society and we owe one another. A bunch of you aren\'t giving to charities, or you\'re giving to charities which discriminate, and that is against the spirit of our nation of helping one another without judgment.""   I think it\'s possible to lean just a little into forcing everyone to pull their weight without devolving into a dictatorship.  So, to conclude and repeat, I don\'t think charity is enough, and I don\'t think it will ever be enough.', 'Do you understand that collectives can have characteristics not held by all members of their groups? You‚Äôre displaying a lack of collective/individual understanding here. Charity does not work. Some individual charities do great work, but charity does not work. The goal of charity is to solve societal problems, and charity does not work in regard.', 'It‚Äôs a government not a charity.']"

Yes lost, twice, so now you need to make up stuff to justify that.  You want to go at it a third round? Let\'s do it. Then after Yes loses again, we\'ll be seeing the temper tantrums again about how people cheated.  One article about some obscure man nobody knows about means absolutely nothing. Maybe go and find how Chretien cheated or something. At the very least my claims come from what that clown Parizeau said.   No scandals? Dude, there were scandals. Don\'t try to make it like there weren\'t. It\'s not a cultural difference, and the French media not covering it really doesn\'t mean anything.   Dude he went into the middle of a live debate to coax the other guy into saying the n-word in front of a black woman. You can make your case for GND,  frankly, I think he\'s a fucking idiot for not saying more, but he\'s also responsible, and we all know why he didn\'t denounce that shit, because in the separatist movement this sort of trash is tolerated and had he said otherwise those people would have pounced on his ass.   No he just went on TV to bait the other separatist leader, because he was throwing red meat to his base, and trying to kneecap GND. I mean, I don\'t know what you\'re defending here, but that dude went straight for that shit on purpose. Like how much more fucking racist can you get than going on a live debate and uttering the n-word, coercing someone else into saying it and then saying it in front of a black woman. There are literally no excuses for that, none whatsoever.  Not even Legault or Duhaime pulled shit like that, and from them you could expect that. Nah, it was the PQ and QS who played that shit on live tv.   I know about that, and I believe it was a terrible thing that was done to them. The reality, however, is that I Quebec today is Canada\'s second-highest GDP. More than that, Quebec gets a lot of special privileges in Canada, most of which I am in agreement with. I have no issue with that, and I have no issue with the province. I chose it, I learned the language, and I would never ever trade that experience for anything.  But I have links to Canada, strong links to it in Toronto and elsewhere in Ontario. I\'m not going to go against that, because I feel strongly attached to Canada as well.   Quebec did not have the same struggles as people of color, and whatever happened there is not comparable. Besides that, what is it that Quebec doesn\'t have today in Canada that is comparable to how people of color in the USA? Like I said, Quebec is the second-biggest GDP in Canada. Quebec has considerable power in anything that the federal government does, most politicians in this country come here to get votes because they cannot win without Quebec. Quebec is literally essential to Canada.  What exactly would be necessary to make enough amends for what was done in the past?   Deny what? Quebec has been given two referendums, and if they wanted a third they would get it. You\'re being denied nothing. Yes lost twice. Maybe you should stop denying that, and maybe you should stop denying that the other Qu√©b√©cois have made their choice to stay in Canada.   Because I already know where this goes. You\'re trying to guilt-trip me by saying things like ""why would you deny Quebec this or that?"" when that is not true at all. I know what comes next, and I know what you\'re going to say, because every time this conversation comes up and separatists find that someone does not agree with them, they resort to cheap tactics. It\'s all over the movement, and that shit with the n-word was exactly that as well.   A moderator from arr Quebec did it once, blocked me because I asked him to produce evidence of how Parizeau was denounced, he couldn\'t, so he blocked me. Others went around calling me a colonizer, a Russian partisan, or denying that I am Latino and calling me an anglophone instead. You want me to see your side? Then start to acknowledge the problems of yours. There\'s a debt to pay in there, and you can blame your fellow separatists for that.   I didn\'t do anything to them. I learned the language, I integrated, and I chose to move here instead of every other place in Canada. I\'m not sure what more can be asked of me. I\'m not some fucking bum coming to Quebec to demand special privileges or ask that I be spoken to in English. But I will also not let people talk me down and tell me shit, because I don\'t agree with their viewpoints. If their cause is so weak that they have no good arguments to convince me then that is their fault.']"

Going back to the cow example, I‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs immoral to eat cows and I have a reason to back that up.

For example, if I force you to give me your shirt on the basis that it‚Äôs moral for me to do so, then you can just force me to give it back by my own morals, and we would be back where we were.  So maintaining moral consistency and respecting individual boundaries in morality are the only logical aspects of morality. The actual definition of what is or isn‚Äôt moral is entirely subjective.

No, not in any meaningful way, and certainly not after 1934. But to address this canard fully, one must begin with the birth of the party.  [https://www.britannica.com/story/were-the-nazis-socialists](https://www.britannica.com/story/were-the-nazis-socialists)  In 1919 a Munich locksmith named Anton Drexler founded the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP; German Workers‚Äô Party). Political parties were still a relatively new phenomenon in Germany, and the DAP‚Äîrenamed the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP; National Socialist German Workers‚Äô Party, or Nazi Party) in 1920‚Äîwas one of several fringe players vying for influence in the early years of the Weimar Republic. It is entirely possible that the Nazis would have remained a regional party, struggling to gain recognition outside Bavaria, had it not been for the efforts of Adolf Hitler. Hitler joined the party shortly after its creation, and by July 1921 he had achieved nearly total control of the Nazi political and paramilitary apparatus.  To say that Hitler understood the value of language would be an enormous understatement. Propaganda played a significant role in his rise to power. To that end, he paid lip service to the tenets suggested by a name like National Socialist German Workers‚Äô Party, but his primary‚Äîindeed, sole‚Äîfocus was on achieving power whatever the cost and advancing his racist, anti-Semitic agenda. After the failure of the Beer Hall Putsch, in November 1923, Hitler became convinced that he needed to utilize the teetering democratic structures of the Weimar government to attain his goals.  Over the following years the brothers Otto and Gregor Strasser did much to grow the party by tying Hitler‚Äôs racist nationalism to socialist rhetoric that appealed to the suffering lower middle classes. In doing so, the Strassers also succeeded in expanding the Nazi reach beyond its traditional Bavarian base. By the late 1920s, however, with the German economy in free fall, Hitler had enlisted support from wealthy industrialists who sought to pursue avowedly anti-socialist policies. Otto Strasser soon recognized that the Nazis were neither a party of socialists nor a party of workers, and in 1930 he broke away to form the anti-capitalist Schwarze Front (Black Front). Gregor remained the head of the left wing of the Nazi Party, but the lot for the ideological soul of the party had been cast."", 'Hitler allied himself with leaders of German conservative and nationalist movements, and in January 1933 German President Paul von Hindenburg appointed him chancellor. Hitler‚Äôs Third Reich had been born, and it was entirely fascist in character. Within two months Hitler achieved full dictatorial power through the Enabling Act. In April 1933 communists, socialists, democrats, and Jews were purged from the German civil service, and trade unions were outlawed the following month. That July Hitler banned all political parties other than his own, and prominent members of the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party were arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps. Lest there be any remaining questions about the political character of the Nazi revolution, Hitler ordered the murder of Gregor Strasser, an act that was carried out on June 30, 1934, during the Night of the Long Knives. Any remaining traces of socialist thought in the Nazi Party had been extinguished.  https://www.britannica.com/story/were-the-nazis-socialists', 'how is it personal? hitler was a socialist after all']"

But no, that was not BS by progressives to deny rights, that BS is still supported by many adherents.   Heller does tie the right to mostly self defense.  I am waiting to see if it applies to the 2d as a whole.  I don't think it does since they acknowledged prohibitions on CCW in sensitive areas.  Sensitive areas didn't seem to be in use at the passage of the Constitution, but maybe during the 14th.     You: On the issue of militias, the national guard is in no way a militia. Me:  I'm sorry you didn't understand the 1916 act defined it as a militia - an organized one. You are also possibly mistaken r ignorant that the normal function of the NG is one weekend a month, and two weeks training in one month?  I know of no standing army that functions that way.  I do remember some of the volunteer militia before the Revolution had vaguely similar schedules.  In ant case - it takes the place of the operating militia as discussed in the constitution.  Some of the militias did get some pay, it was by no means uniform.  But my assertion that the NG is the militia is correct.  The unorganized, as stated previously, are your enlistment/draft base.       Let me make this very clear so you understand.  After the first year of the revolutionary war, the volunteer militia were found to be worthless.  Read George Washington's letters convincing congress to that effect.  It was so bad he considered volunteer militia ungovernable.  So the militia became a more structured and enlisted group in order to be useful and dependable.  So if there are any collective rights - they are vested in the NG by Congress and the States.       Let me also make it clear, the only functioning militia recognized by the State and Fed is the National Guard - the rest is just draft/enlist pool called the unorganized militia.  The unorganized militia have no claim to weapons of war, etc., only to light armament as would be needed for self-defense, or hunting, target shooting.      Google doesn't show anything in Bruen acknowledging defending liberty from our government.  If you can locate that, I'd like to assess it.    I admire all of your quotes, but we have a standing military, and the National Guard which we tried to avoid by having State/Fed  Militia.  We even disbanded troops and sunk Naval ships later, but couldn't avoid it.  So the term militia still bounces around some code and has some historical meaning, but has no real life in today's world unless drug up here or in a court setting.  I'm a Midwest boy so being skeptical of the Government is one of the things I do. Have to go.  Hope this posts"", ""It's literally providing the right to a militia and the right to keep and bear arms. That's literally what it says."", 'The collective rights claim started in the 1870s, by judges who wanted to deny people of their rights. It was strongly taken up by progressives, as a way to deny people of rights they did not want them to exercise. It was also rejected by Miller, Heller, McDonald, Bruen, and Caetano.   The founding fathers never talk about collective rights. It‚Äôs not mentioned in our founding documents. What they did talk about, repeatedly, and what is recognized in our founding documents, are individual rights. Our country is founded on the concept of individual rights.   Even with the argument that 2A only applied to militia service, you‚Äôre talking about an individual right, because militia members are expected to supply their own arms; thus they must individually have the right to possess arms. Furthermore, 2A protects a right to keep, meaning own, arms. It doesn‚Äôt protect a right to bear community held arms in militia service. Personal ownership is an individual right.   Those who hold a collective rights position on 2A are those who want to deny rights. The writings of the founding fathers and the ratifying debates are very clear that it is an individual right that all Americans have.  As far as 2A being a right that is intended to allow the people to resist tyranny: it was mentioned in the oral arguments for Bruen. It was also noted, in the McDonald case, that 2A was enumerated to allow the people to resist a tyrannical government.   The Heller ruling specifically notes that 2A was enumerated because the founding fathers feared the government would disarm the people, and this would allow a standing army to rule. In other words, it was enumerated to allow the people to resist tyranny. Heller further notes that, although this purpose is written in the prefatory clause as a reason for the right, it is not the only purpose for the right. Notice, it did not say that this was not a purpose for the right; just that it was not the *only* purpose for it.  What did the heller ruling say?  1. 2A protects an individual right, not a collective right  2. 2A did not just protect those arms useful for a militia, but all arms commonly used at the time; meaning it doesn‚Äôt just protect the keeping of arms in use at the time of ratification. It does not state that it only protects those arms used for self defense; although, in truth, all arms can be used for self defense. 3. The constitutional standard of review for 2A is one of text informed by the history and tradition of gun laws at the time of ratification.   What did the Bruen ruling say?  1. There is a right to bear arms outside of the home.   2. States could not have arbitrary conditions for carry permits; that prohibit average Americans, who are not prohibited people, from exercising their right to bear arms.   3. Self defense is a constitutionally valid reason to be armed.   4. It reaffirmed the standard of review for gun regulation, that was established by heller. In order to show a modern gun law is constitutional, it is the burden of the government to show a corresponding law from the time of ratification. Laws from the time of reconstruction can be used, although they will carry less weight, as long as they do not contradict the tradition of the time of ratification. It did not establish that the only purpose for 2A is self defense.  You don‚Äôt have to wait to see if this standard of review applies to 2A, as a whole, or just CCW. Besides the fact that the language of both Heller and Bruen plainly stated that all gun regulations have to pass this standard of review, the Supreme Court took up a few AW bans and mag bans, after the Bruen ruling was released. They struck the lower courts‚Äô rulings in favor of these laws, and sent the cases back to the lower courts with insurrections to make new rulings **based off of the standards set by the Bruen ruling**.  So, it‚Äôs very obvious that the standard applies to 2A, as a whole.   A militia is a military force drawn from the civilian population *to supplement the army during an emergency*. Throughout all of history, militiamen have been required to furnish their own arms and equipment. You can go back to Anglo Saxon England and see that Fyrd( militia) members were expected to have their own arms. The king did not supply their arms.  NG members do not supply their own arms. The government arms and equips them. Yes, they have limited times of service, like a part time military, but their required NG time is not limited to training. They also do not supplement the other military branches, as additional forces to aid the primary military. They are put to use, instead of other branches, the same way each other branch gets applied to its own tasks. I imagine you are familiar with the army reserve. They serve one weekend a month and a two week summer camp. Very similar to the NG, really; except they don‚Äôt get called into service unless the regular army needs more soldiers. In spite of this similarity, the army reserve isn‚Äôt considered a militia. It‚Äôs part of the army: meaning it‚Äôs standing army. The NG is considered another branch of the military.   ‚ÄúThe NG is a state based military force that becomes part of the reserve components of the US Army and US Air Force when activated for federal missions. It is a military reserve force composed of NG *military* members or units of each state...‚Äù  https://constitutionalmilitia.org/national-guard-not-a-militia/  DeSantis planned to revive Florida‚Äôs state militia, although there is a Florida NG, and this is because the NG is not a state militia.   Your anecdote about Washington is being misapplied. Originally, the founding fathers had not wanted to give the federal government the power to even have a military. They wanted to solely use state militias for national defense, because standing armies get used against the people. They changed their minds about this, because they realized militias, alone, could not properly defend the country. So, they gave the government the power to have a standing army, and felt that the fact that all of the people would be armed would prevent that military from being used successfully against the people. It was always intended that all the people be armed in similar manner to the military, and history will show you that this was the state of things, until the 20th century. Therefore, by the Bruen standard of review, the unorganized militia ( meaning all of the people) definitely have a claim to all the weapons of a soldier.  ‚ÄúCongress have no power to disarm the militia. **Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American**.... [T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.‚Äù  -Tenche Cox    The number of civilian ( unorganized ) militias, in the US, has exploded over the last few years, so I think reality disagrees with you.   You don‚Äôt sound too skeptical of government to me. In fact, you seem to think our rights come from the constitution and the government, and that government has the just power to decide what our rights are and what their powers are. Our rights do not come from the government. They do not come from the constitution. They come ‚Äòfrom our creator‚Äô. They are natural rights. The constitution protects them. Government is not the supreme law of the land. The constitution is. Any law that contradicts the constitution is not valid- Alexander Hamilton.   If you let the government determine your rights, you will end up with no rights, and if you let the government determine its own limitations, it will have no limitations.  You should check out the Tenth Amendment Center. You‚Äôd be better informed of your rights and the constitution.  https://youtube.com/@TenthAmendmentCenter']"

Now firstly it is a fact that the original woman compared her pay as head of the China Desk with the man who was head of the US Desk.  Similar title, but hardly the same job as the US Desk was a full time position that required relocation to the USA whilst the China Desk was a 2 day per week job and she stayed in London.  So not the same at all.  Secondly, she took a fat pay rise, after publicly saying she refused an offer of higher pay as she felt she was ‚Äúpaid enough‚Äù and was supposedly mindful of the BBC being publicly funded!  But in the final settlement, certain men did have their pay cut.  Not missed out on pay rises, but actually had their pay cut - it seems as if this actually was part of what these women demanded.  As for suing.  It‚Äôs sounds good, but it‚Äôs costly and it‚Äôs hard to prove that you didn‚Äôt get a pay rise because you‚Äôre male and the company wants to equalise male/female earnings.  But the ‚Äútransparency‚Äù explicitly introduced to show the discrepancy and to pressure companies to reduce it.  That is the reason for it.  A company is seen as doing well by reducing the difference.  That‚Äôs all that will be looked at in reality.  Studies like the above will mostly slip under the radar.  Even you demanded ‚Äúevidence‚Äù that pay gaps were being reduced by lower male wages growth.  What chance this will change?    There is ZERO pressure to do anything about the pay gap in twenty somethings.  Feminists either deny it exists in favour of women, or say that it‚Äôs right because women are better.  The media has not taken it up, nor are there signs it will.  This *might* change in the future, but it will take years and more likely decades.  And chances are the transparency will be dispensed with once it ceases to work in favour of feminist goals.  Just as quotas were dispensed with in Swedish universities when it was mostly working against women.  Just look at who is pushing this stuff in California to see that it is not intended to do anything about the twenty something earnings gap.  And will your law allow for differentiation on the basis of skills, experience, hours worked or value produced in its ‚Äútransparency‚Äù?  Or will it be more a gross aggregate ‚Äúmen earn this on average‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen earn that on average‚Äù?

For context, 5000 Marines were victims of sexual assault in 2021 alone, which included the statistic that 13% of female marines were victims. But please, explain to me how the military is ‚Äúpruning people to conform to their woke ideology of the regime.‚Äù Yet the administration and the Pentagon have already expressed that they will accept the removal of the mandate because of its minuscule impact on recruitment, yet here they are still dragging their feet on sexual assault.

Isn‚Äôt #metoo and #believeallwomen part of a woke ideology or do we get to cherry pick what is or isn‚Äôt part of it to suite the situation?  Aggravating that people become experts from a NYPost article.

Yet everyone chimes in about the fall of Rome when some radlib pockets some money over a study that won‚Äôt be implemented and was commissioned almost 3 years ago, and how I‚Äôm the crazy one for positing that ‚Äúactually it‚Äôs the shitty labor conditions and the general disregard for SVM dignity that is causing readiness problems.‚Äù No no no, it‚Äôs about some non-existent ideological purity that no one who spends a minute around the AD community actually cares about', ' Again, thank you for telling me about the cultural context of the organization I‚Äôve been inextricably a part of for 7 years person who‚Äôs not even from this fucking country. That is literally what happened you fucking dope. 10% of the American military sees active combat: the majority of the American military, including the Marines, are non-physical administrative and support roles. *Material* changes to those gender and sexual orientation restrictions were implemented to increase the potential recruitment pool without significantly increasing compensation and pay, the PR therein was just a secondary benefit. Just like it is in any other industry that wants to expand its labor pool. *Appearing* to be inclusive is the goal behind actually getting more numbers in the board.  Physical fitness standards have been loosening in the military for years. Is it because they don‚Äôt want to be fatphobic? No, it‚Äôs because the majority of enlisted roles are technical and they were losing out on retention and recruitment goals on those technical roles since America as a whole has gotten fatter. Now active field and combat roles have additional physical requirements.  The American military has also started to loosen its rules regarding usage of marijuana and anti-depressants for new recruits. Is it because they believe these people are heckin valid and vouch for #selfcare? No, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs becoming more legalized and that they were loosing out on recruitment goals by precluding people who smoked. They still ban marijuana usage while active and severely limit access to psychotic medications because **ding ding ding** readiness matters most.  And yeah, please go to literally any forum with actual active duty members who were around since the changes in allowing homosexuals, and every single one of them will tell you that DADT wasn‚Äôt enforced and that homosexuals were serving openly prior to the official integration in 2011, because people in the military aren‚Äôt some monolith and they don‚Äôt actually care about that kind of shit, they just care that people do their jobs.  I literally had a drill instructor that was a flaming gay man that called everyone ratchet. 25% of my recruit division was too stupid to even notice that he was gay, and not a single person in bootcamp actually gave a fuck that he was a) because he was a good instructor and b) because we were significantly more worried about doing what we were supposed to be doing, not worrying about being indoctrinated. He only ever officially disclosed his orientation to a recruit on the last day during a relaxed Q&amp;A about Fleet life when a recruit asked if he was ever scared during DADT. He literally said to them ‚Äúno one cares that you‚Äôre gay, just do your fucking job.‚Äù  Because the only thing that actually matters from the enlisted personnel is their role as a *LABOR FORCE.* The DoD has, and will continue to, shift their cultural decrees and public relations stances for the purpose of maximizing their recruitment pool and effectiveness of extraction of labor from their workforce, regardless of who is in power ‚Äúin the regime.‚Äù', ' Oh hey, look at that, a direct quote from a General with the material justification for a progressive policy. Absolutely incredible to me that you quote that SCOTUS case without any irony despite the actual argument West Point is making about how the officer corps needs diversity in order to more effectively organize the labor of the enlisted military. Almost as if this ‚Äúideological purity‚Äù they‚Äôre striving for is a position who‚Äôs primary purpose is to maximize the effectiveness of extracting labor from the enlisted. Rather than arguing with their material claims or conclusions, you just write off the decision as being ‚Äúideologically motivated.‚Äù   Inb4 you act like I approve of West Points argument: I don‚Äôt, simply because people by and large don‚Äôt actually care about racial representation in their leadership, they just want good leaders who have similar material contexts. West Point goes wrong when they think a poor black enlisted person would be better off with rich black officer, when in reality a poor black enlisted person would have a better functional relationship with a white officer who grew up in comparable material conditions.   Yeah man, any time they do something you ideologically agree with it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre trying to trick you or play the long game despite the risk that‚Äôd supposedly have on their ideological purity a year away from an election. There‚Äôs no material explanation like recruitment and retention that better explains it.   You know enlisted branches don‚Äôt even have diversity quotas right? Even in your West Point example, that was a studied they did with regards to race balancing in context of reflecting the racial make up of the enlisted sections of the military. The service academies are legally excerpt from Affirmative Action and are statistically less diverse than non-service Universities. Again, I‚Äôll say this till I‚Äôm blue in the face, please give me any proof that the *enlisted military* has any ideological requirements of its labor force and how those trump the effectiveness of those peoples‚Äô labor.     That‚Äôs exactly my point! The military establishment was literally *behind* the culture and ideological context of its labor force! It was literally illegal to be gay but the culture of the labor force was able to counteract that **top down** policy because they cared more about the work getting done. Funny that when it‚Äôs a conservative ideologically position it‚Äôs ‚Äúlingering‚Äù but when it‚Äôs a progressive one it‚Äôs ‚Äúunanimously unpopular and ideological warfare.‚Äù    I don‚Äôt even disagree with you doofus. My point is that progressivism is only a tool in order to maximize the extraction of labor, and that progressivism will be thrown out in favor of conservatism if Capital seems if and when it‚Äôs effective to do so. But to use your homosexuality example, why is it that when something because popular enough you just don‚Äôt have to call it progressive regardless of what legal and political power is behind that idea?  Again, if you‚Äôre gonna wax poetic about culture and ideology, at least talk to real people about it for 5 fucking seconds before assuming some bullshit study that won‚Äôt even be implemented is more important than labor conditions.']

Just because someone didn't earn a bar does not mean they'll be approved for another visa. As an analogy, just because you don't have a felony record (only misdemeanor) does not mean you will get the job. A felony will automatically disqualify you from most jobs, but a misdemeanor is more discretionary (e.g. underage drinking okay, theft not okay).  While there is no explicit bar for overstaying less than 180 days, the odds of getting another visa is slim. The visa holder has demonstrated that they will not abide by the terms of the visa. Unless the circumstances are very compelling (e.g. overstayed by a few days because of an unexpected flight cancellation, hospitalized, etc), the discretionary circumstances do not warrant issuing another visa.  The bar (once you cross 180 days) is a lot stricter. Even if the circumstances are out of the visa holder's control, the officer cannot waive the bar by law.  In other words, the law gives officers discretion with overstays less than 180 days to determine if the reasons for overstaying are compelling. If the reasons are not compelling, the officer will still deny the visa. Past 180 days, the officer does not have discretion and must deny the visa for the next 3/10 years."", ""Others have mentioned this but just adding for reinforcement. They won't incur a bar if they leave before accruing 180 days of unlawful presence. Their visa will get revoked though. They'll be free to apply for another visa immediately as they won't have a bar, and they may actually get it, but it's far likelier that they'll be denied.  The main thing that visa officials evaluate when approving/denying a visa is whether the recipient will abuse their visa and use it to overstay. When they initially issued your friend's visa, the officials' determination was that they were unlikely to overstay. Now they have concrete proof that they are, in fact, a very high risk of overstaying. Overcoming this will be difficult in the near, and potentially distant, future until your friend's circumstances change enough to convince immigration officials that this has changed.  That's why people with certain profiles and with certain countries are never able to get tourist visas A young man from Central America with few ties to his home country and lots of manual labor experience will almost certainly never be approved for a visa, despite never being subject to a bar."", 'A tourist visa is not the same as an F-1 visa.

Joseph Rosenbaum knew or should have known that his violent, unprovoked assault on an openly armed person would lead to serious injury or death for himself.

You blame Rittenhouse for the events of that night simply because he was there trying to protect his community from bad faith actors who were trying to destroy it, yet the violent career criminal who attacked Rittenhouse is spared from fault.

You denigrate Rittenhouse by pointing out that he traveled from outside of the area to be there and did so while armed, yet you hail Gaige Grosskreutz when he traveled further than Rittenhouse did, with no ties to the community, and unlike Rittenhouse he did so while *illegally* armed because his concealed weapons permit had been revoked after his felony conviction.

If China truly pushed the issue, I don't think many would allow China to simply take the territory."", ""No offense, but your opinion here is super cringe and not true at all.  Taiwan has massively increased it's defense spending recently, and has allocated billions of dollars to mass producing long range missiles.  Keep in mind that the USA terminated Taiwan's nuke program in the late 1980s, which is why China feels it can attack with impunity now.  And on top of all that, Taiwan has paid the USA for 20 billion dollars of weapons and military equipment that the USA hasn't delivered yet.  So it looks like America is the cause of this problem, not Taiwan. Btw I'm an American in Taiwan and nobody here wants to get invaded.

This is all possible because the student loans are guaranteed.  The school will get their money so they don‚Äôt need to make tuition affordable and make sure students can afford it.  On one hand this lets poor kids get an education, on the other hand it drives up the cost of tuition because everyone can afford college.', 'This is 6 years old, but it shows how much states have cut funding for higher education. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fancy-dorms-arent-the-main-reason-tuition-is-skyrocketing/  Edit  In 2000, Temple University was primarily a commuter school. On-campus dorms could house fewer than 4,000 students out of a total student body of more than 30,000. Most facilities were badly outdated, and the average student paid $12,800 a year (in 2016 dollars) in tuition to attend.  Today, Temple, where I work, looks very different. Beautiful new buildings are the norm rather than the exception. A recently built 24-story dorm and adjoining dining center highlights the university‚Äôs transition to a residential campus. Each of the dorm‚Äôs apartment-style suites comes equipped with a flat-screen TV and other amenities. The number of administrators in management and executive positions has grown by 40 percent to over 900. Oh, and tuition now runs $19,000 for the typical student after accounting for scholarships and other aid.  It‚Äôs tempting to blame Temple‚Äôs shiny buildings and new administrators for the big increase in tuition. But there‚Äôs another, much more important reason for the rising costs: Over the same period, Pennsylvania‚Äôs state government cut its per-student appropriations by $6,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars.  The rapid increase in the cost of college in recent decades ‚Äî and the associated explosion in student debt, which now totals nearly $1.3 trillion nationally ‚Äî is all too familiar to many Americans. But few understand what has caused the tuition boom, particularly at the public institutions that enroll roughly two-thirds of all students at four-year colleges. Many commenters,\xa0particularly\xa0in the\xa0popular press, focus on ballooning administrative budgets and extravagant student amenities. Those elements have played a role, to be sure, but by far the single biggest driver of rising tuitions for public colleges has been declining state funding for higher education.  It is true that today‚Äôs students enjoy better amenities ‚Äî usually in the form of nicer gyms, dorms and dining halls, though some campuses feature\xa0lazy rivers and climbing walls\xa0‚Äî than I or, especially, my parents did during our time in college. It is also true that today‚Äôs universities employ far more administrators and staff who don‚Äôt have any direct role in either research or instruction. When my father attended the University of Florida1\xa0in the 1970s, professors were required to also serve as academic advisors and meet individually with students to plan their schedules. Today, schools retain many staffers whose role is to assist both faculty and students. Some of those jobs are easy to mock: One\xa0frustrated grad student\xa0built a\xa0job-title generator\xa0that spits out bloated titles such as vice executive for the committee on dining relations.  Recent Stories from FiveThirtyEight  ÔøºTop Storiesby\xa0FiveThirtyEight00:3701:12ÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº33 Cool Charts We MadeIn 2022  And it is also true that professors (at least those on the tenure track) are paid better than the people who held those same jobs years ago. Average salaries for full professors (the highest rank) at\xa0top public institutions exceed\xa0$160,000 annually. Salaries for full professors have risen 12 percent in excess of inflation since 2000.  All of those trends add to the cost of college, but not by that much. At most, about a quarter of the increase in college tuition since 2000 can be attributed to rising faculty salaries, improved amenities and administrative bloat. By comparison, the decline in state support accounts for about three-quarters of the rising cost of college.  Consider Pennsylvania‚Äôs four public research institutions,2\xa0one of which is Temple.3\xa0Average tuition revenue per student (adjusted for inflation) increased by $5,880 between the 2000-01 and 2013-14 academic years (the most recent available data). State appropriations per student have declined nearly $4,000 over the same period, from about $7,750 to $3,900. Put another way, if Pennsylvania restored funding for higher education to its 2000 levels, Pennsylvania‚Äôs public research institutions could reduce tuition by nearly $4,000 per year without altering their budgets. For students, the impact could be even greater once loan fees and interest were taken into account.  By contrast, imagine that each of these institutions cut per-student spending for student services, administration and instruction back to 2000 levels, then passed those savings on to students in the form of lower tuition. How much would students save? Reducing student services would save each student $380 per year. Dropping all those new administrators would save $150 per student per year. And rolling back spending on faculty salaries would save $850 per year for the average student. Together, those three categories have added $1,380 to the cost of attendance since 2000, about a quarter of the total increase. At least some of that spending benefits students directly: Student-service spending has been found to increase the\xa0likelihood of graduating, and increased spending on instruction leads to\xa0higher earnings\xa0later in life.  National trends for all public four-year schools mirror those from the research institutions of Pennsylvania, although there are sizable differences across states, as the table below shows. In the median state, South Carolina, the decline in state appropriations explains 81 percent of the increase in tuition revenue. Only three states ‚Äî Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming ‚Äî have kept funding for higher education on pace with inflation and enrollment growth (represented by negative numbers in the table). In 17 states, the price of college would have actually\xa0declined\xa0since 2000 (states with a share greater than 100 percent in the table) if funding had been kept constant and the schools applied that money entirely to students‚Äô tuition bills. While state funding has rebounded somewhat during the economic recovery following the Great Recession, most states‚Äô increases have not kept pace with enrollment growth.']"

The postcards were to convince Jews that their loved ones were not being murdered or tortured, not to convince them that they would be treated like regular humans there.

(whew!)  So the first thing you might notice is .. those were all published very late, right?  The vast majority of them were published after 1990, which means they were most likely published after the person who had written them had died. That\'s interesting.  Why is that?  Why werent their tons more publsihed in the early decades when everybody who was directly affected .. was still alive?  So lets do a sub-selection, shall we?  Lets just look at the ones published before 1990, and I will mark what they are about (generally either ""ghetto experiences"" or ""camp experiences"").  *1982 - Dorian, Emil. The Quality of Witness: A Romanian Diary, 1937-1944* (About living in Bucharest. References to the Warsaw Ghetto, and a reference to the rumour of ""poison gas"" although apparently Dorian vastly underestimated the number of victims from what we know today to be the truth. At any rate, Dorian died in 1958, his diary was published in 1982. Reviewers say Emil was quite a poetic writer!)  *1971 - Flinker, Moishe. Young Moshe‚Äôs Diary: The Spiritual Torment of a Jewish Boy in Nazi Europe* (The USHMM description makes it sound like this is about his experience in Auschwitz, but it is actually about his experience living in Belgium.  Apparently the entire family was found in Brussels and deported to Auschwitz in 44, but the diary ends before Auschwitz. Moishe and his parents were reportedly killed in Auschwitz, but his 5 sisters and younger brother all survived the camp (a miracle!) and when they returned to their old apartment in Brussels after the war, they found young Moishe\'s diary ""in an old shoebox in the attic"" (actually it was a box in the cellar) and it was published first in Israel in 1958.)  *1974 - Hahn, Lili. White Flags of Surrender. Washington, DC: R.B. Luce* (Records the observations of a young woman with a non-Jewish father and Jewish mother as the Third Reich slowly gained power in Germany. Not about camps. Not much about this one in general, but I have found an online copy so I might read it later.)  *1953 - Kalmanovitsh, Zelig. ‚ÄúA Diary of the Nazi Ghetto in Vilna.‚Äù YIVO Annual of Jewish Social Science 8* (Records the activities of a boy in the Vilna ghetto from June of 1942 to June of 1943 before he was deported and killed in a camp in Estonia.  Hard to find information but I would assume his diary was found ""in an old shoebox in the attic"" in Vilnius after his death. Reviewers say the diary is exceptionally written, considering the author was only 14 years old at the time.)  *1964 - Katzenelson, Itzhak. Vittel Diary (22.5.43-16.9.43). Tel Aviv: Ghetto Fighters‚Äô House* (Mostly about the Ghetto, but also a good deal about Treblinka where he and his family were killed in 1943. Ruth Adler, a German Jew from Dresden who had a British Palestinian passport, received permission to leave the country in an exchange for German Prisoners of War. In the leather handle of her suitcase, she smuggled a copy out of the Vittel Camp and then she went to Israel/Palestine, where the piece was first published in May 1945, after the death of the author. Again - this particular diarist was quite a gifted writer. One reviewer says - ""Katznelson was a poet and dramatist and it shows in his diary"")  *1983 - Kermish, Joseph, editor. ‚ÄúDaily Entries of Hersh Wasser.‚Äù Yad Vashem Studies 15* (Translation of a diary kept by Hersh Wasser, a Polish Zionist who was active in the effort to record life in the Warsaw Ghetto as part of the Ringelblum Archives. Wasser survived the Holocaust, and together with his wife, immigrated to Israel in 1950, where he died in 1981.  His diary with his remarkable experiences was published posthumously the year after his death.)  *1967 - Kermish, Joseph, editor. ‚ÄúExtract from the Diary of Abraham Levin.‚Äù Yad Vashem Studies 6* (Presents diary excerpts from June and July, 1942, kept by historian Abraham Levin in the Warsaw ghetto and stored as part of the Ringelblum Archives. Not much about the author. But I would bet it was published after his death. Feel free to correct me on that.)  *1973 - Klonitski, Aryeh. The Diary of Adam‚Äôs Father: The Diary of Aryeh Klonicki (Klonymus) and His Wife Malwina, with Letters Concerning the Fate of their Child Adam* (Translation of a diary kept by a husband and wife covering a two-week period during the final liquidation phase of Jews from the Galicia region. Documents the last weeks of their lives as they hide from the Nazis as well as their fears for their infant son.  The fate of the author is unknown, with some sources showing he died in 1943, and others saying he survived the war but was living in Ukraine and wanted nothing to do with his relatives.  At any rate, his diary was published ""in his name"" and who can say if he ever read it?  lol  I will stop there.  But ..  do you notice any commonalities?   First - there is barely anything about the camps written in those earlier diaries. It\'s mostly about the ghettos and ""general observations"" about what was going on.  Why werent camp survivors coming out in this time with their unbelievable experiences?  Second - with 1 possible exception up there all those diaries were published after the death of their author.  This seems to be a common thing.  Not sure why. Hmm. It would be cool to get to interview the author about the information in their diary, right?  The author could also get whatever attention/credit/adulations/money they are due that could maybe offset some of what they suffered, right?  But for some reason, these things always seem to come out after their subject is gone from this world.  Third - these rare diaries that have been found ""in shoeboxes in the attic"" after the deaths of their authors always seem to be *fantastically* written!  Wasnt anyone keeping an interesting/relevant diary who was just a .. shitty writer?  Apparently not.   And how many *werent* like that? How many were perfectly capable and educated adults? 10? 20? Surely a few, right?  Werent there even authors, playwrights, etc in the camps?  Talk about ""a good idea for a book"" and ""write about what you know"" .. right?  At any rate, those young diarists can be surprisingly excellent writers!  But .. why dont we have diaries from people who survived, and who released their dramatic diaries shortly after the war while they were alive?

Congress decided the pension ‚Äúsavings‚Äù could help patch the retiree health benefit underfunding.

(The net expenditures of the USPS are classified as ‚Äúoff-budget.‚Äù) **Thus, CBO estimates the net cost to the unified budget will be $1.5 billion over the 2007-2016 period.** All of those effects reflect changes in direct spending. The legislation does not affect federal revenues.  H.R. 6407 will not affect how much the federal government spends on pension or health care benefits for USPS retirees.

The shift in the mail mix from First-Class Mail to lower revenue-per piece classes has resulted in stagnant revenue growth and shrinking contribution. By 2008 1st Class Mail fell into a steep decline in  the Great Recession of 2008. From 2008 to 2010, First-Class Mail volume declined by 13.4 billion pieces.   * This decline persisted through 2010, beyond the official end of the recession.   As bad as the First-Class Mail decline was, it was dwarfed by the decline in Marketing Mail/Spam Mail. USPS had projected that, Standard Mail volume would have had to grow by 43.2 billion pieces by 2010 to help in revenue offsetting.

In 2008, Standard Mail volume declined by 4.3 percent, only slightly worse than the 3 percent decline in 2002 recession. Rather than recovering as it did in 2003, Standard Mail went into a nose dive, falling 16.8 percent more in 2009  Having lost First Class Mail in 2008, the USPS was dependent on Junk Mail post 2008 Recession.

COVID replicates and produces a range of unknown proteins. Your body fights these off by making antibodies. A wide range of antibodies. When COVID mutates, which it does very frequently, your body will still have antibodies for some of the proteins in the new variant. This makes it easier to fight off new strains.  The mRNA vaccine turns your cell into a protein factory, not a vaccine factory as this video suggests. The mRNA vaccine tells your cell to produce the spike protein and your immune system creates antibodies for this protein.   What's the difference? The vaccine causes you to make specific antibodies instead of a range of antibodies. That's why you keep getting COVID with every new variant. That's why you catch the flu and a cold every year. A proper vaccine is IMPOSSIBLE. It's just meant to help lessen symptoms.  But let's look at what's being made, the spike protein. The spike protein is what needs to be researched more. These spikes are doing the damage to your heart (myocarditis), vascular cell walls(miniature blood clots) and they accumulate in your ovaries and gonads( causing a hormone imbalance).   You claim there is no replication, but the initial dosage correlates to how many cells are affected with the vaccine. As moderna had a higher dosage, we saw more adverse reactions with moderna.   It's very possible that the cells do replicate as studies have shown liver cells have undergone DNA changes to include the spike protein. If this is true, then there is replication.  Let's say it's not. The cell will continue producing the spike for it's life. The body will continue fighting the spike by producing antibodies and your immune system will remain elevated until these cells naturally die off. So although you will have antibodies, your immune system is at a temporarily weakened state for weeks minimum.  The antibody memory from vaccines has shown to wane just after a few months. Naturally immunity has no such issue.  Lastly, the virus targets your respiratory system where as the vaccine is entering your cardiovascular system and can literally go to any organ in your body. Do you want your heart cells producing spike proteins? Do you want your testes producing spike proteins?  The mRNA technology is a form of Gene therapy. Is the technology bad? No. It's quite amazing and may be the future of medicine. Is it ready for prime time? You could argue both yes and no. Is the spike protein toxic? It appears so!  So would you rather have a free floating spike protein traveling to all parts of your body? Or a spike protein attached to a cell?

However, while it is easy to give evidence that life is deterministic, you have no evidence that the fact that it is deterministic means you cannot simultaneously have free will.  Compatibilism holds that determinism can exist simultaneously with autonomy. I somewhat agree with this, but I do not believe necessarily that people have full autonomy. Compatibiliists also believe, if I understand correctly, that humans are either free or they are not. I do not agree with that. I am saying that there's every possibility that humans are both free and not free simultaneously. And that possibility could exist in different forms. Perhaps it means people are partially free. Or perhaps it means that Free Will and Not Free Will are not true opposites. Or perhaps it means that they are different dimensions of something larger. I know what I'm saying is hard to understand. That's why I used the examples. You are right that the computer one is a poor one.  And I wasn't clear whether you were stating that autonomy is synonymous with free will.

Since its passive income, do you propose we eliminate the 401k?', 'Yes and no. It depends on your tax bracket, income future, and age. For example, an athlete‚Äôs who will retire early is better using a 401k since their income drops dramatically post retirement and 401k lowers their taxes during their peak years. Roth is better for most young people because their income will go up over time as their income goes up with experience', ""Some great advice here. I agree with everything you said.  The only thing I would consider is that if you are in a higher tax bracket today than you will be at retirement, you should fund your 401k before the ROTH IRA. Then, take the tax savings you realize today from the 401k and put that in the ROTH IRA. For example, let's say your marginal tax rate today is 24%. When you put 6k in the 401k, you will realize a $1440 tax savings today. Take that $1440 and put it in a  ROTH. Your total cash outflows will be the same 6k, but you will have saved $7,440 dollars for the year. Then, at retirement, if you are in a lower bracket, you pay less tax when you pull out of your 401k. Also, lots of states tax retirement income more favorably than they do earned income, so you may save there too.""]"

Yes, AI art can enable the creation of personalized art, where the artwork can be customized or tailored to the preferences or characteristics of the viewer for no cost or almost no cost. It can be used as to test out clothings on yourself and redesign your house or anything. 2. AI art can enable the creation of art that is more efficient or cost-effective to produce. For example, AI can be used to automate tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming or labor-intensive, such as creating detailed patterns, repeating elements, or background in an artwork. 3. If the technology evolves a bit, AI Art is helpful for T2V(text2video) where you can create short films or long ones that might have been expensive and time consuming to create by hand and it's accessible to small-time creators. CGI can become realistic without massive MCU budgets. 4. AI art can enable the creation of art that is more immersive and interactive, by allowing the viewer to interact with the artwork in real-time or by incorporating elements of virtual or augmented reality. 5. Indie can use AI Art to quickly brainstorm ideas for their media. People in fashion industry or architecture or interior designers can use AI Art to see all the great ways to make clothing or buildings or design interiors. Writers without artistic skills or money can quickly make comic books with great art. 6. Photoshop becomes much easier and accessible to common person without the need to invest in time training for it. 7. AI art can enable the creation of art that is more inclusive and accessible, by using AI tools to enable people with disabilities or other challenges to create and engage with art in ways that may not have been possible before. 8. The technology behind AI Art can be used as zero-shot image classifiers that can be put inside robots to recognize what they're looking at. 9. I even heard of diffusion models creating synthetic images of brain being used for study by scientists without ethical issues. 10.

I‚Äôd prefer a world of abundance where there are enough resources for everyone to live wealthy lives, and 90% of the world would be ecologically protected. That requires a smaller population.   Not that that‚Äôs what my comment was about; it was about how emissions is only a small factor in the current mass extinction event. The real problem is how much land we use. Unfortunately even if everyone went vegan, and livestock agriculture was converted to feed people plants, the population would just increase to match the increased for supply and we‚Äôd end up in a worse place than we started if we had just left the cows alone (also a bad idea though).', "" Could you post a link for this, please? I've never heard of it.  There are many problems associated with raising cows, not just carbon emissions. They are a huge cause of habitat loss and extinctions, as massive areas of land are cleared for them to graze and for us to grow their feedcrops. Animal agriculture is the leading cause of habitat loss and extinctions, and cows are by far the largest contributors to that, both in absolute numbers and per animal and per calorie of food produced. They also cause massive amounts of eutrophication, again, IIRC they are the leading cause of that, too.    Why?   Yeah, I do know that, I have no problem with them going extinct. The reason I find extinctions to be bad is because of the individual deaths of animals and for the knock-on effects on ecosystems. But cows that humans breed will all suffer the same fate anyway, even if we all gradually go vegan, the cows will be killed for meat in the normal way and we'll just slowly breed fewer and fewer. And since cows haven't evolved with their ecosystems, since humans have bred them in captivity, they haven't evolved to function alongside other species and, in fact, do immense damage to ecosystems. So the extinction of cows wouldn't come with any added deaths to individuals (and would decrease individual deaths long term, as we stop breeding them just to kill them) and not only would it not come with the usual detrimental effects on ecosystems, but it would actually be beneficial. So, the extinction of cows would be a good thing.   That's not what the science says. Many analyses show that veganism is far more environmentally friendly than any other diet."", 'I totally agree with you, cows are a waste of resources.   Again, animal agriculture was sustainable for thousands of years until the industrial revolution. Thousands of years is strong evidence against saying there‚Äôs ‚Äúno way‚Äù it‚Äôs sustainable. It is highly sustainable to feed a smaller number of people.   Similarly, if we start using that other 45% to feed people instead of livestock, the human population will just increase to match the food supply (as it literally always does), and we‚Äôre in a worse position than if we had just left the cows alone.']"

Growth is not good or bad, you are correct about that also, and if my post made it seem like I was saying it was good or bad, that's my bad for misspeaking.    The problem is how we use our resources. Apple could make a cell phone that is more easily repairable, but does not so it can sell more electronics.  That's not a sustainable use of resources, but the demand for growth in profits is demanded from the shareholders.   We could build better houses that last longer, and will be cheaper in the long run, but investors in development firms demand the growth of profits. Those homes use more energy than they otherwise would have, and will have to be torn down sooner than an otherwise better built house.   That's not sustainable, and that uses more resources.    That's the fundamental issue here, is the growth in how many resources we are using.  You agree that the population will grow, and we can make everything more efficient, but ultimately the Earth can only replenish resources so quickly, and the Earth can only support a certain number of people at a certain consumption level.  We can make things more efficient, but we can't escape physics.    We need to reduce the resources per Capita that we are using, otherwise our modem society will collapse in the not too distant future.

Un parti f√©d√©raliste √©tait alors au pouvoir √† ce moment (et pour longtemps) au Qu√©bec. Le PLC au f√©d√©ral se donnait aussi √† coeur joie sur les d√©penses pour √©craser le mouvement d\'ind√©pendance. Tu peux te renseigner sur le ""scandale des commandites"".   &amp;#x200B;   Merci de prouver mon point qu\'on parle bien de deux culture diff√©rentes. Donc, pour √™tre plus clair, citer le titre d\'un livre, lorsque le contexte s\'y donne, chez les qu√©b√©cois francophone, n\'est pas mal vu.   &amp;#x200B;   Ben oui c\'en est une. Si le sujet est un livre avec le nword dans son titre, ben au Qu√©bec franco on ne censure pas et on trouve plus important de pouvoir dire de quoi on parle. Personne n\'a essay√© de blesser la dame de couleur.    &amp;#x200B;   Mais √©videmment que c\'est irrespectueux de dire le nword dans la rue. Pourquoi irais-je dire ce mot en pleine rue si ce n\'est que pour provoquer et r√©pandre de la haine? M√™me chose si je vais dire le titre du livre en question dans la rue comme √ßa. Je n\'ai jamais dit le contraire. L\'important, c\'est le contexte. Quand un animateur de t√©l√© demande si la libert√© acad√©mique, m√©diatique et politique doit permettre de citer tous les titres de livres, il n\'y a rien de mal √† r√©pondre ""oui"", et il n\'y a rien de mal √† prouver son honn√™tet√© et donner un exemple. Tout est une question de contexte. Tu as le droit d\'√™tre en d√©saccord avec moi, mais le fait qu\'il n\'y a eu aucune controverse dans le Qu√©bec francophone suite √† cet √©change t√©l√©vis√© prouve que les qu√©b√©cois francophones pensent comme je viens d\'expliquer.   &amp;#x200B;   J\'esp√®re que tu es conscient que tu d√©fends ici ton point de vue de personne qui se sent Canadien avant d\'√™tre Qu√©b√©cois. Essayes de prendre le point de vue de quelqu\'un qui se sent Qu√©b√©cois avant tout. De ce point de vue, m√™me si le ""Canada ne sera jamais la m√™me chose"" si le Qu√©bec devient un pays, √ßa ne change pas grand chose.   Tu parles aussi de la diff√©rence entre les Canadiens et les Am√©ricains comme raison pour pr√©venir un merge du Canada et des √âtats-Unis. Pour quelles raisons? Surement pour emp√™cher que les Am√©ricains d√©cident des politiques Canadiennes √† leur place? Eh bien c\'est la m√™me chose pour ceux qui se sentent Qu√©b√©cois avant tout, ils ne veulent pas que les Canadiens prennent des d√©cisions les concernant.   &amp;#x200B;   √áa ne change absolument rien. Le f√©d√©ral est d√©j√† pitoyable dans sa gestion des territoires et droits autochtones.   &amp;#x200B;   Voici quelques citations:   &amp;#x200B;   112 000 immigrants impos√©s par le f√©d√©ral quand on n\'obtient m√™me pas le % de francophones voulu √† 50 000.

Laisses moi savoir, je t\'en pris, si je t\'ai manqu√© de respect.', ' C\'est pas assez. Je veux √©vidence irr√©futable, pas d\'articles et des opinions. √áa ne marche pas pour moi. Sinon, c\'est pas diff√©rent des choses que Trump et ses partisans font quand ils disent que leur √©lection avait √©t√© vol√©. La sp√©culation sur gouvernements lib√©raux √©lus d√©mocratiquement ne m\'int√©resse pas. Si tu me vas dire qu\'ils ont trich√© aussi, ne t\'emb√™t√© pas. Tes arguments ne sont pas valides. Tu ne peux pas juste venir ici, dire que le ""non"" a vol√© le referendum et que leurs gouvernements ont supprim√© le mouvement de l\'ind√©pendance.  J\'ai besoin de plus qu\'articles et choses qu\'un juge avait dit. En plus, il n\'y a pas d\'outrage, si les choses que t\'as dites √©taient vraies, la soci√©t√© qu√©b√©coise n\'aurait jamais accept√© √ßa. Ce que tu dis est impossible, et si c\'est un point commun des souverainistes, il sera moins possible de que je leur donne mon soutien. On ne peut pas simplement nier le choix des gens, et le choix dans 1995 √©tait ""non"". Si tu veux une autre referendum, bien, tu peux exiger √ßa, mais tu ne peux jamais dire que les choix des gens sont invalides √† cause de sp√©culation des articles.   Oui, et c\'est pour √ßa que le Qu√©bec √† pouvoir pour changer ces d√©cisions, en plus d\'avoir un parti f√©d√©ral, chose que les autres provinces n\'ont pas. Je suis d√©sol√©e, mais ces choses sont les conditions pour √™tre partie du Canada, chose que le Qu√©bec avait d√©cid√© de faire dans 1980 et 1995. C\'est la loi, si tu ne l\'aimes pas, chiale aux autres qu√©b√©cois qui ont d√©cid√© de rester au Canada.   C\'est trop mal pour toi, parce que les traites sont avec le f√©d√©ral, pas avec Qu√©bec, et les autochtones ont dit maintes et maintes fois qu\'ils ne vont pas n√©gocier avec Qu√©bec.   Dis-le dans la rue, alors. Quel est le probl√®me ? Si tu ne le trouves pas acceptable √† le dire comme √ßa, pourquoi est-ce qu\'il est acceptable de le dire dans un d√©bat t√©l√©vis√© en face d\'un femme noire ? Est-ce que les politiciens s√©paratistes ont carte blanche √† dire ce qu\'ils veulent ?   Quel est le probl√®me ici ? Est-ce que c\'est impossible de trouver un compromis ? Legault parait qu\'il est ouvert √† √ßa, non ?  Honn√™tement, je suis fini. Si tu ne vas pas donner √©vidence valide pour dire que le f√©d√©ral a vol√© l\'√©lection, alors ces sont mensonges, mensonges qui ont le m√™me caract√®re que les mensonges de Trump.  C\'est la m√™me chose avec le n-word, tu ne peux pas attendre que j\'accepte ton explication si tu vas me dire que c\'est incorrecte de dire le n-word dans la rue, mais pas dans un d√©bat t√©l√©vis√© o√π il y a une femme noire.  C\'est assez, il n\'y aura jamais un compromis entre moi et les s√©paratistes. Je voterai toujours contre eux. Leur cause ne m\'a pas donn√© une bonne raison de penser qu\'ils savent que c\'est ce qu\'ils font. Tes arguments moins.  Je ne vois pas une voie ou je serai d\'accord avec l\'ind√©pendance. Ce mouvement est un poison, et c\'est plein de fanatiques.', "" C'est la nature de ces choses, t'as ton point de vue et j'ai le mien, mais peut-√™tre, il y a un compromis. Je continuerai cette conversation en fran√ßais, et nous nous comprendrons dans la langue du Qu√©bec.    Plus √©vidence. Je ne crois pas qu'un article de 2013 et une affirmation d'un juge sont assez pour dire que le referendum √©tait invalide.  Non, c'est pas assez, si tu vas dire ces choses, to dois avoir √©vidence qui le confirme 100%. Comprends-tu ce que tu dis ? C'est une accusation s√©rieuse et si les choses √©taient comme √ßa, alors, j'aurais attendu √† un outrage. La soci√©t√© qu√©b√©coise n'aurait jamais accept√© √ßa.    Dans les m√©dias anglos. Qu'est-ce que tu vas dire ? Que √ßa ne compte pas ? Pourquoi pas ? Non, c'est compl√®tement raciste. Il y avait un million d'autres choses √† dire et PSPP avait choisi de dire le n-word et de forcer √† une autre personne a le dire aussi. Les deux chefs s√©paratistes l'ont dit, en face d'une femme noire, en plus du monde entier. Plus tu combats ce point, moins je fais confiance √† ce mouvement. Il y a 0 justifications pour ce comportement, 0. C'est pas une chose culturelle, non, on ne dit jamais le n-word, et ce n'est pas une chose anglaise. Si tu penses d'autre mani√®re, je mets au d√©fi d'aller dire √ßa au milieu de la rue.  En France, on ne peut pas dire ces choses, moins √† Montr√©al. Il n'y a aucune raison pourquoi je devrais accepter ce type de choses dans un d√©bat t√©l√©vis√©.    Oui, c'est pas facile pour moi. J'aime le Qu√©bec, plus que mon ancien pays. Qu√©bec c'est chez-moi. Je ne veux pas avoir √† choisir entre eux, et les s√©paratistes ne comprennent pas la difficult√© de ces choses pour nous, les immigrants. Il y a plusieurs personnes que disaient de choses m√©chantes pour nos choix. Nous n'avons pas choisi d'√™tre ins√©r√©s dans ce conflit, mais nous recevons les balles des deux c√¥t√©s. Oui, il y a des anglos imb√©ciles qui viennent √† dire choses tout le temps, sp√©cialement quand on d√©fend aux qu√©b√©cois et au Qu√©bec. Ils ont beaucoup √† dire aussi. Par exemple, je suis d'accord que le serment au roi est une stupidit√©. Un imb√©cile anglo m'avait dit que c'√©tait temps pour moi de sortir du Canada, et que si on √©tait dans les temps anciens, ils m'auraient vir√© sans probl√®me et qu'il n'aurait pas de probl√®me avec √ßa.   La seule chose que j'exige est respect. On peut croire ce qu'on veut, mais je ne comprends pas pourquoi je devrais supporter des choses comme √ßa.    Non, jamais, nous sommes Canadiens, pas Am√©ricains. C'est pas la m√™me  chose de toute fa√ßon. Si le Qu√©bec sorti, Canada ne sera jamais le m√™me chose. En plus, sais-tu les implications de √ßa ? Il y a plusieurs complications comme les disputes de territoire avec les autochtones, le St. Laurent, les traitres de commerce avec les [√âtats-Unis](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/u-s-wouldn-t-have-recognized-quebec-independence-in-wake-of-yes-vote-in-1995-1.1730253). C'est un cauchemar social, √©conomique et politique pour tout le monde.   Quand les s√©paratistes attendent mon soutien, ils attendent que je suis √† faveur de potentiellement d√©truire le Canada. √áa n'arrivera jamais, pas pour moi.    Je ne sais pas, pourquoi est-ce que tu continues de faire r√©f√©rence √† ce th√®me si t'as cette opinion ?    C'est pas vrai. Je suis immigrant, et je sais comme le syst√®me fonctionne. Tu ne peux pas immigrer au Qu√©bec de la m√™me mani√®re que le reste du Canada. Si tu fais √ßa, tu devrais traiter avec le gouvernement Qu√©b√©cois et t'as besoin de suivre leurs proc√©dures. Si tu ne connais pas le fran√ßais, bonne chance, tu ne vas pas rester au Qu√©bec. En plus, c'est pas assez d'obtenir autorisation du gouvernement qu√©b√©cois, tu devrais traiter avec le f√©d√©ral aussi.  Le Qu√©bec a beaucoup de pouvoir pour choisir leurs immigrants, plus que les autres provinces.    Ouais, et rappelle une chose, j'ai choisi de faire √ßa. Ma langue maternelle est l'espagnol, ils ne parlent pas fran√ßais √† mon ancien pays. J'ai fait √ßa avant d'arriver au Canada, qui est 130% plus que tous les autres immigrants, et en plus que les Canadiens eux-m√™mes qui rarement parlent fran√ßais.    J'ai choisi le Qu√©bec et Montr√©al comme chez-moi, pas Toronto et l'Ontario, pas Calgary et l'Alberta, et pas Vancouver et la Colombie-Britannique. C'est beaucoup d'exiger que mon opinion soit respect√© ? Je ne suis pas un colonisateur, un partisan qui suivre les ordres du f√©d√©ral ou un envahisseur qui vient √† supprimer la culture qu√©b√©coise.   Je pense que t'es raisonnable. Ne pense pas tu, que c'est injuste quand les autres s√©paratistes disent ces choses m√©chantes ? Ne penses-tu pas que j'ai mes raisons pour ne pas vouloir soutenir un mouvement qui a des gens qui disent ces choses. En plus je ne suis pas comme les autres immigrants, s'il y a gens qui veulent trouver probl√®mes avec moi, je vais les faire pour eux. Je ne suis pas un tabarnak, je ne reculerai pas.""]"

I never said every Islamic country adhered to the same culture of dress that Algeria does.   2. If a man dressed head to toe, covering his face, wants his wife to do the same, then certainly that is not hypocritical. Regardless, it doesn't matter if you didn't observe it, there are still plenty of Muslim men that *don't* dress like what is essentially a niqab with pants, who want their wives to do so. You don't have to see something for it to exist. And regardless, this is actual a perfect example of culture not reflecting religion. The doctrine of Islam itself, regardless of local customs, expects more modesty out of women than men.

Religion does not justify child abuse. You do not have the right to no if your kid is gay. This is defending a parent‚Äôs right to abuse their child if they believe it isn‚Äôt abuse.   Furries aren‚Äôt LGBTQ. Using fringe edge cases to defend conduct that is absolutely abusive for the cases that actually occur is bad logic.   No, encouraging a gay child not to be gay is abusive.  There are demographics risks *caused* by the type of parents who‚Äôs children don‚Äôt want to come out to them. If you‚Äôre concerned about the demographic risk to your kid, but you‚Äôre a homophobe, then you‚Äôre a hypocrite because it‚Äôs homophobes that cause that risk. Outing an LGBT child to their hateful parents is much risked than the general demographic risks. If you want to protect your kid, be the type of parent who your child feels comfortable come out to.   For fucks sake, being gay is not at all equivalent to thinking you‚Äôre a dinosaur. You clearly haven‚Äôt met gay people. A child‚Äôs sexual orientation is not their parent‚Äôs choice and attempts to change that are abuse. I also note you didn‚Äôt actually address my question. What would you think of a gay parent trying to make their child gay, telling them it‚Äôs morally unacceptable to be straight, telling them they will be disowned or kicked out for being straight? Would you call that abuse? Because homophobic parents do that *constantly*.   To give them information, sure.   Nothing in my statements came close to ‚Äúeveryone would agree with my values if could just see it.‚Äù My statement was ‚Äúchildren should be free to learn about and explore value systems.‚Äù You inarguably twisted the second to the first.   They don‚Äôt have a right to know. Children are not the property of their parents, and their well-being supersedes a parent‚Äôs right to indoctrinate or abuse them. A child‚Äôs sexual orientation is no one‚Äôs business but their own.  Your position defends and excuses abusive parents, stop.', ' There are two parts of that section of the bill - one which bans talking about identity in K-3 (keep in mind these are 5 to 8 year olds) and one which bans talking about orientation in ways that aren\'t age appropriate generally. My example was speaking specifically to the age appropriateness of talking about orientation. Under this bill, it would be fine for a gay kindergarten teacher to talk about his husband. It would not be fine for a gay kindergarten teacher to say ""some boys are sexually attracted to girls and some boys are sexually attracted to boys"" - it is precisely the sexual aspect that is banned, because that is the aspect that isn\'t age appropriate.   This is all the bill does, though.   ""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age accordance with state standards""  That\'s all it says.   Keep in mind that these are kids aged 5 to 8. There is no appropriate way to have a conversation with a child about sexual orientation when they don\'t even know what sex is. In the 3rd grade, kids are mastering how to make change from a dollar and how to read a map, if that helps contextualize the age group. Conservatives aren\'t doing a bait and switch about sex and sexual orientation, its just that talking to an eight year old about sexual orientation _really is that creepy_. Google image search ""8 year olds"" then imagine going up to one of them in public and telling them you\'re gay. Or straight for that matter. Its super creepy. It shouldn\'t come up.   I personally wouldn\'t have a problem with it - I\'ve had nieces and nephews around this age and it never came up. If it did come up and the adult brought it up, I\'d want them investigated for grooming. If the kid brought it up, I\'d want them investigated for potential abuse. Kids this age just don\'t notice that kind of thing unless someone has gone out of their way to make sure they did.', 'Not accepting that your kid is gay is abusive. How can you consider a teacher not telling homophobic parents that their kid is gay more abusive than parents being homophobic to their gay kid?  One actually does harm to the child, the other protects a child from harm. And teachers have an *obligation* to teach things that may contradict the religion of student‚Äôs parents. There are a lot of people who want their kids to believe in young earth creationism. Teachers are morally and legally obligated to teach kids that the universe is 14 billion years old and that evolution is real.  And? They‚Äôre still free to do that. But if they‚Äôre doing that to force their kid not to be gay, that‚Äôs child abuse.   Absolutely not. Their sex life becomes their business at the age of consent. Their sexual orientation is their business from the moment they are born. No one has a right to dictate the sexual orientation of anyone else. Ask yourself what you would think of a gay parent who tried to make their kid be gay. That‚Äôs clearly child abuse, and straight parent trying to make their kid straight is abuse as well.   It‚Äôs absolutely not the same thing. A kid wanting to keep things from their parents isn‚Äôt inherently a problem unless what they‚Äôre keeping from their parents is abuse. And you‚Äôre clearly twisting my words. If a non-Christian kid found they were interested in Christianity and went to talk to a Christian teacher about that, I‚Äôve got no problem with that. That‚Äôs not ‚Äúoh everyone would agree with my values‚Äù that‚Äôs ‚Äúkids get to explore what philosophies and value systems they want‚Äù.

The only reason Christmas feels like a secular holiday is because of the thin or complete lack of separation of church and state and the fact that most of these countries have Christianity as a cultural foundational theology. In a city that starts playing Christmas music in November, it\'s inescapable and participation is often forced in work contexts. A ""holiday"" party at work with a tree, lights, and presents the week before everyone gets Christmas off is just a Christmas party. There is nothing secular about this concept.

No it is not. That is a trite and useless observation. Subjective value theory predicts the same thing.   The LtV is *Explicitly* a theory about how the magnitude of value is exactly equal to the magnitude of embodied labor time.    A theory of value that only applies to mass produced fungible commodities (and only when they are at equilibrium prices) hardly seems like a good theory.   Why not stick with subjective value theory? It applies to all goods at all times.    Congrats! You‚Äôve now admitted that the LTV is just a subjective theory of value. If the price of labor is subjectively determined by the laborer‚Äôs needs and wants, then all value is subjectively determined!  Marx made the same error and was unable to reconcile this with his assertion that values are objective.', "" No, socially necessary labour time is the time an aveeage worker needs to produce given product. Think of it as a percentage of the total productive capacity of a country spent on a good or a service. Production of mudpies do take a percentage but doesn't contribute any use value.   SNLT is labour time, not money. Money is the universal exchage token for trading goods on the market. Labour is the universal cost of producing them. The monetary value (Price) of given type of labour on the market is revenue minus expenses (Not including salary) but the actually paid value is only the salary and the rest is profit for the employer.    Yeah LTV doesn't deal with useless stuff but isn't contradicted by them either. This is not to say that LTV is the end all and be all of economics. Far from it. Both the Subjective theory of value and the Marginal theory of value have their place but keep in mind all theories use the term value but actually mean very different things.   The SNLT of mudpies is not changed. How many hours of work are needed to produce something isnt affected by how good or bad it is for society. Of course is society is damaged by something like and decides it is worth it to get rid of it that consumes labour time as well but is a second calculation of the SNLT of a service with a positive impact. Use value (utility) can be negative such as the example with nuclear waste on its own or positive such as a wanted product. Value (SNLT) can not be negative because no method of production consumes negative  time. Finally the exchage value (Price) is the relationship between one comodity and the market (aka. all alternative purchases).  It is essential to differentiate between the 3 terms in order to understand the LTV. Thinking solely in dollars is easier but can tell you only 1/3 of the LTV.""]"

Routine infant male circumcision does cause pain and permanent loss of healthy tissue.   Australian Federation of Aids organizations They state that circumcision has ""no role"" in the HIV epidemic.   The German Association of Pediatricians called for a ban recently.  The German Association of Child and Youth Doctors recently Attacked the AAP\'s claims, saying the benefits they claim, including HIV reduction, are ""questionable,"" and that ""Seen from the outside, cultural bias reflecting the normality of non-therapeutic male circumcision in the US seems obvious, and the report‚Äôs conclusions are different from those reached by doctors in other parts of the Western world, including Europe, Canada, and Australia."" (scroll to page 7 for the English translation.)  The AAP was recently attacked by the President of the British Association of Paediatric Urologists because the evidence of benefit is weak, and they are promoting ""Irreversible mutilating surgery.""  The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan has taken a position against it, saying it is harmful and will likely be considered illegal in the future, given the number of men who are angry that it was done to them and are becoming activists against it.  The President of the Saskatchewan Medical Association has said the same).  The Central Union for Child Welfare ‚Äúconsiders that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person‚Ä¶ Circumcision can only be allowed to independent major persons, both women and men, after it has been ascertained that the person in question wants it of his or her own free will and he or she has not been subjected to pressure.‚Äù  Royal College of Surgeons of England ""The one absolute indication for circumcision is scarring of the opening of the foreskin making it non- retractable (pathological phimosis). This is unusual before five years of age.""...""The parents and, when competent, the child, must be made fully aware of the implications of this operation as it is a non-reversible procedure."" |  British Medical Association it is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks. .... very similar arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification. Furthermore, the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with the damage that can be done to the individual‚Äôs relationship with his parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the procedure. .... parental preference alone is not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child. .... The BMA considers that the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it. |  Australian Medical Association Has a policy of discouraging it, ad says ""The Australian College of Paediatrics should continue to discourage the practice of circumcision in newborns.""  Australian College of Paediatrics: ""The possibility that routine circumcision may contravene human rights has been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor and is without proven medical benefit. Whether these legal concerns are valid will probably only be known if the matter is determined in a court of law .....Neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication. It is a traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia to remove a normal and healthy prepuce.""|  74% of Australian doctors overall believe circumcision should not be offered, and 51% consider it abuse. Circumcision used to be common in Australia, but the movement against it spread faster there than America, where rates continue to drop.  A letter by the South African Medical Association said this:  The Committee stated that it was unethical and illegal to perform circumcision on infant boys in this instance. In particular, the Committee expressed serious concern that not enough scientifically-based evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions prevented HIV contraction and that the public at large was influenced by incorrect and misrepresented information. The Committee reiterated its view that it did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission.|  The Norwegian Council of Medical Ethics states that ritual circumcision of boys is not consistent with important principles of medical ethics, that it is without medical value, and should not be paid for with public funds.  The Norwegian Children‚Äôs Ombudsman is opposed as well.  The Denmark National Council for Children is also opposed.  And recently, the politically appointed Health minister of Norway opposed a ban on circumcision, yet the ban was supported by the Norwegian Medical Association, the Norwegian Nurses Organization, the Norwegian Ombudsman for Children, and the University of Oslo. The Danish Society of Medical Practitioners Recently said the practice is ‚Äúan assault and should be banned.‚Äù The Danish Medical Association is ‚Äúfundamentally opposed to male circumcision unless there is a medical reason such as phimosis for carrying out the operation. ‚ÄòIt\'s very intrusive that adults may decide that newborn to undergo a surgical procedure that is not medically justified and if power is lifelong.

Ineffective at what? You can\'t exactly measure fertilization in vivo.  All you can look at are outcomes.   Does Plan B show a statistically significant decrease in pregnancies over a control group after ovulation? The data shows that it does not have any statistically significant decrease in pregnancies, therefore prevention of implantation **cannot** be a mechanism of action.  All these studies that show it prevents implantation do so without comparing outcomes, we see just as many pregnancies as we would expect from ovulation without the contraceptive, so while there may be other mechanisms at play in vivo we can eliminate prevention of implantation (and thus any abortifacient properties it may have).     Noe directly addresses this in my link:  * As we noted in the introduction of our paper, the action of LNG-EC on endometrial histology and function has been widely investigated [9,10]. One recent study demonstrates no effect of LNG on human implantation in vitro.  * As indicated, the direct effect of LNG-EC on fertilization cannot be investigated in vivo in humans. Hence, the ratio observed/expected pregnancies has become the acknowledged means to estimate the efficacy of LNG-EC. In the group of women taking LNG after ovulation in our study and in that of Novikova et al, **the rate of pregnancy negates that postfertilization effects play a role in the mechanism of action of LNG-EC** [1,2].

Malign deflation is a symptom of an economy that's doing poorly and is NOT a good thing. This type of deflation has caused Japan in particular serious problems. Yay, low prices... Until you realise that due to the economic slowdown caused, you have a Lower wage, unemployment and other problems. Prices lowering also causes drops in spending, why buy something for 5$ when it could be 4$ next week? During times of economic uncertainty and poor confidence, why would people spend and invest more seeing as this type of deflation as I've said is the result of an economy doing badly.   Benign deflation however is regarded by virtually everyone as positive. Its a drop in prices caused by competition, improvements in productivity, innovation and new capital improvements etc etc. Nobody is against this sort.  I think you should read more about deflation and the effects it had on the Japanese economy before accusing everyone who is against deflation as 'parroting propaganda'."", ""Oh man. You really arent familiar with economics are you? You DON'T GET MALIGN DEFLATION WITHOUT UNEMPLOYMENT AS WELL.  I literally feel like a broken record, so I will explain it for you as simply as possible as I'm guessing youve never studied economics before.  You cannot get deflation just happening by magic. It is a result of *something* happening in the economy.  Now, benign deflation you can think of as good deflation. This is due to business improvements and investment, lower prices as the cost of production is lowered. This is great for business and consumers alike.  However, not all deflation is benign. We also have malign deflation, known as Bad deflation. This happens as a result of sudden demand shock, caused by unemployment for example. This is why I have mentioned it. Therefore, you'd suffer the effects of this unemployment also along with this deflation, which is why it is considered to be BAD.  Therefore straight up saying deflation is good or bad depends on whether it is malign or benign. You cannot group all deflation under one heading. You saying deflation isn't bad is a ignorant statement, you must understand the different types before you can say it is good or bad.

There is absolutely no evidence of this aside from a few Tweets posted by random people (though I assume that\'s enough for you to believe it given the rest of your comment). Zelensky\'s net worth is estimated to be around $20m due in large part to his career as an actor.    He has not outlawed ""opposition"". He has outlawed certain parties that had direct ties to Russia that made up roughly 10% of the government. And yeah, that\'s not great, but that\'s kind of what you need to do during wartime. Churchill outlawed the British Nazi Party during WWII. It\'s a bad idea to allow parties allied with the country you\'re fighting a war against. There are still seven different parties in the Ukrainian Parliament aside from Zelensky\'s party, many of which are part of the opposition.   Again, he has not done this. He did not outlaw an entire religious denomination. He disbanded certain churches tied to Russia that were aiding Russia in the war.   Yet again, this is a lie that you were stupid enough to believe.

Yeah, there are probably Neo-Nazis in the Ukrainian Military. There are horrible people in every military. But there is no dedicated Neo-Nazi unit. That is literal Russian propaganda. ""Denazification"" is the reason Putin gave for the invasion in the first place. You are stupid enough to believe Russian propaganda. Jesus Christ, dude.   I mean yeah. It\'s a war. This happens.

It very well may have been Russian.    We\'re fine. We have plenty of resources. These weapons were specifically built to kill Russians, and now not only are they carrying out their purpose, but they\'re doing it without a single American life being lost. I don\'t know why anyone would see that as a problem.    He literally thanked America *today* for all of their help you idiot.    So this one confuses me. What is Ukraine supposed to do? Roll over and die? Is it a bad thing that Zelensky is deciding to fight against Russia after they invaded his country unprovoked? I imagine there would be far more innocent lives lost if Russia was allowed to just steamroll the entire country.

We observe that constantly. Even AIG themselves acknowledge that that is a real thing. It is unquestionably a fact.  It is not a fact that ""the theory of evolution via natural selection as proposed by Darwin and modified by further research by countless scientists is true.""   In other words, when we say ""evolution is a fact"", we are talking about the phenomena of evolution, not the theory that science has shown best explains the phenomena.   We make this point because a small subset of creationists so are fundamentally misinformed that they deny that evolution occurs *at all,* despite it being extremely well documented.   [I linked to an article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_as_fact_and_theory) that goes deeper into why evolution is both a fact and a theory, but it is absolutely true that it is both.', ' You know that we have been to space, right? We have literally seen the entire earth. What new evidence do you imagine that could overturn the conclusion that the earth is an oblate spheroid? You really need to read this: https://hermiene.net/essays-trans/relativity_of_wrong.html   [facepalm]  Did you even bother to read my earlier comments? I explained this in detail. I\'ll explain again, with even smaller words:  Evolution as a phenomena is the observed fact that populations change over time. We know this happens because we have observed it on every level.   Evolution as a theory is the explanation for WHY evolution as a phenomena occurs.   Evolution as a phenomena is a fact.   Evolution as a theory is not a fact.   Evolutions as a theory is extremely well supported by overwhelming evidence, but science will never, ever conclude that evolution is ""the truth"" because science does not address the truth when it comes to explanations. There always could be some new piece of evidence that is  discovered that shows a flaw in the theory.   It\'s also worth noting that you are completely wrong when you suggest that evolution could be ""refuted"". It can\'t. At least not in a meaningful sense.  The evidence that the theory of evolution is correct is overwhelming, and comes from many diverse fields of science. No single new discovery could ever show that ToE is totally false. In order to do that, you would need to find hundreds or thousands of new pieces of evidence, all of which are completely incompatible with the existing explanation. That won\'t happen. We haven\'t found a single piece of such evidence since Darwin\'s days, so it is simply unreasonable to believe that we will suddenly start finding mountains of it now.  What could happen, and happens all the time, is that new evidence could be found that causes us to slightly reformulate our current theory. Unlike religion, science has no issue with this. It is literally the core of science: You adapt your understandings to account for new evidence as it becomes available.    The ToE we have today is not the ToE that Darwin came up with. It is not even the same ToE that we had a year ago.   But what we know today is based on the theory Darwin formulated, updated to account for all the new things we have discovered over the last 175 years or so.', 'You can also say that the theory is factual, in the colloquial sense, being as observed evolution happens as the theory suggests it should. The theory is built from facts and it has led to many confirmed predictions and it‚Äôs about as close to a factually accurate description of biological evolution and how it works.   In science ‚Äúfact‚Äù is more like a verified/demonstrated/observed data point but that doesn‚Äôt mean that theories aren‚Äôt all pretty much all factual to some degree. It‚Äôs a fact that evolution happens pretty much as the theory says it happens and not just that evolution happens at all.   Creationists have very little trouble accepting that evolution happens at all. It‚Äôs the explanation for how evolution happens, the evolutionary history or life, the concept of universal common ancestry, and how this *could* be extended to include a large portion of what we call ‚Äúabiogenesis‚Äù considering how autocatalytic RNA molecules evolve and form spontaneously via ordinary physics and chemistry. The problem is when God is taken out of the equation. That‚Äôs why they treat science like it‚Äôs an atheist cult that a lot of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Taoists, etc. participate in. I‚Äôve even had people tell me that science is just one giant conspiracy that the people trying to prove each other wrong don‚Äôt realize they are propagating.   It‚Äôs a fact that the theory of biological evolution is pretty damn factual. It‚Äôs also a fact that populations change. Creationists object to the first but they can‚Äôt hide from the second. It‚Äôs too obvious.  **Edit:** In terms of calling the theory ‚Äúfactual‚Äù I should reiterate this by stating that the theory describes how evolution happens and then when we watch evolution happen it‚Äôs the same as the theory describes. There may be some nuance or you could hypothetically say that there‚Äôs a god toying with us by creating things that only match our expectations when it comes to what we didn‚Äôt watch evolve. You could say we‚Äôve been implanted with false memories when it comes to what we‚Äôve observed.   You can make up all sorts of unfounded assumptions about what might really be going on that we only mistake as the theory providing an actual factual description of evolution, but outside of these unfounded assumptions you‚Äôll see a one to one correlation between what the theory says happens and what observe happening. There‚Äôs always room for improvement and there‚Äôs always the hypothetical chance we‚Äôre wrong, but I had a rather drawn out discussion about how we can‚Äôt consider theories factual because that implies that we already found the absolute truth, or something along those lines.   To be clear, this was never my intention. The theory of evolution is one of the best supported theories in science. It‚Äôs the most hated by fundamentalists. It‚Äôs withstood over a century of scrutiny. It holds up. What it describes is what we see. It‚Äôs like the germ theory of disease, oxygen theory, or the the theory about the shape of our planet. It‚Äôll always be the provisional truth just in case we‚Äôre wrong, but at this point in time there‚Äôs no reason to consider it a false explanation for how evolution occurs. It seems pretty accurate. As far as we can tell it provides a factual explanation. As such, it‚Äôs not too absurd to treat it as such.']"

Again, it\'s wealth, more than education which directly impacts crime and criminality (I was talking specifically about commission of crimes rather than prevention through better enforcement, but of course you\'d be correct if you said that we can\'t know commission rates accurately without good enforcement, so it still seems to follow that wealth is the single biggest factor, since we would expect *more* crime to be reported among the wealthy, all else equal, yet we see less...and it probably way less, because it gets reported less among the poor).   I don\'t believe we have good evidence for that one way or another. I\'m sure it will be a mix.  But in any case, these are all motives which are most directly affected by wealth/poverty.  You can find the dumbest low-life out there, and they almost certainly at one point or another, regurgitated to themselves or others, the wisdom of not getting addicted to drugs, or not acting greedily or rashly, but to instead plan and work hard and save (and get educated) and move out of the hood or away from temptations.  They all *know* better (in fact I\'d argue that they know it better, and feel it more deeply, than any highly educated person who\'s never had to grow up in the hood or slums or favellas or whatever).   Sure...again, I might not be understanding you, but I think that they tend to focus more on policies which prioritize education than on wealth; and even when they focus on wealth its always only transfers or welfare...not ways to invigorate people\'s economic opportunities and engender the purpose and dignity and self-respect which tend to come with economic growth, especially building a career or a business.  Prioritizing education though does have a lot of other benefits for reducing crime; given the poor conditions that many kids find themselves in, just being in school instead of on the streets does alleviate a lot of opportunity for crime. So that\'s probably the most powerful mechanism for education to directly affect crime.   It depends what we mean by regulation. Government regulation and intervention occur in layers...there\'s always unintended consequences and failures and political externality which plague government action; from the very basic existence of the state which can be captured, to the highest level, esoteric financial regulations meant to tweak some tiny incentive among investment bankers; and while they are often a net-negative on the whole, they did mostly come about for ""good"" (read: expedient) reasons and so the second best option isn\'t just to deregulate the top few layers off...that will just expose people to the bad consequences which the higher layer of regulations had mitigated.  Sometimes the bad regulatory structure is the second best, and the first best would be a radical liberalization of the entire sector or economy.  But government liberalizing or deregulating doesn\'t necessarily mean no rules or laws or regulations; sometimes institutions or markets just restructure in ways to not need those specific government regulations and sometimes markets provide regulatory incentives or incentives for market actors to abide by non-governmental regulatory bodies (e.g. IIHS or UL). Point being...   That I *do* disagree with this, partly at least, because it doesn\'t have to be the case that giving liberties must result in a libertine free-for-all (which yes, I agree, any set of people, educated or rich or not, will act poorly in that context).  Rules and norms and laws and regulations- we\'re likely to get better ones out of more educated societies, yes.  But again, that\'s going to be a very indirect effect on crime- and I\'m also not convinced that better regulation (market or government) isn\'t also just a matter of built up social capital and experience and robust (wealthy) economies and markets...there\'s so much about modern wealthy society which just nudges us into better behavior, with or without us having to have the education or wisdom to understand the rules deeply or have a philosophical appreciation for them.  Just like each new level of physical capital which we produce, serves as a platform of tools with which to leap into the next level of productivity, such that a million high school dropouts can make a living operating equipment which is the culmination of the knowledge of just a few exceptionally smart scientist and engineers...so too can laws and rules and regs become like social capital which even poorly educated people can avail themselves of and build upon for even better cooperation.  /sorry for the tome...its an interesting subject', 'Yeah but they do in fact have both more violent crime and crime in general']"

It just further enforces the idea that we live in a two tiered society where the rich play by different rules and rarely see justice for their actions.  I think we should absolutely have fines that scale with income/wealth so the rich can‚Äôt break the rules with impunity and not give a fuck.  How many times have you seen these almost $1T companies getting hit with a measly $500,000 fine for some illegal/shady business practice that made them hundreds of millions of profits. How can being fined less than 1% of the profit made from such practice be a deterrent..its basically just a business expense at that point.

Because no AI routinely spits out the exact same answer, verbatim, multiple times. Yet ChatGPT has the exact answer to any [leading] question about transgender people being their biological sex.   ‚ÄúIt is not accurate or respectful to say that transgender women are ""____."" Doing so suggests that a person\'s gender identity is defined solely by their biological sex, which is not true.  Gender identity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person\'s identity that is separate from biological sex. It is the gender that a person feels most closely aligned with and identifies as. For some people, this may be the same as the sex they were assigned at birth, but for others, it may be different.  It is important to recognize and respect the gender identity of all individuals, including transgender people. This means acknowledging and using the name, pronouns, and other forms of self-expression that are most appropriate and meaningful to them.  In general, it is important to be mindful of the language and terminology that you use when discussing issues related to gender and identity. Using inclusive and respectful language can help to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all people, regardless of their gender identity.   That‚Äôs very clearly a designed response.', ""Part 1: (sorry this reply is so long)  &amp;#x200B;  As I said, cis just means 'not trans' in the same way straight means 'not gay' (and both ran into similar problems of some people not properly fitting into one or the other). So when I say that trans women experience sexism in the same way as cis women, I am using that definition of 'cis'. It essentially means people that we both agree are women (i.e. 99% of women). So please interpret me according to the way I am using words, rather than your own definitions.  I don't know why you are saying that I am only trying to help a small group and leave out everyone else, when I have made it clear that I think we should be combatting the patriarchy along every axis, and should ultimately be aiming for gender abolition.   &amp;#x200B;  There is a distinction to be made between the psychological causes and the social causes of sexist harassment. What is going through the minds of men as they harass women may have very little to do with the broader social phenomena that lead to harassment.  E.g. the social causes of low-level harassment like catcalling is an idea that women's appearances are public property, and there to be judged, whereas the psychological cause will often be that the man genuinely thinks he is being complementary, or at least being funny. If we're interested in reducing sexual harassment across society, rather than just in one specific person, it is the social view that will be helpful.  Whether it is a cis woman or a trans woman being sexually harassed, the social cause is the same: that men feel they're allowed to subject others to their sexualisation, and that it's those people's responsibility to put up with it. Even if the man is specifically thinking 'I only want to sexually harass her if she has a vagina' at the time, that doesn't make any difference to the person being sexually harassed, they are affected the same way regardless.  So I don't think the psychological causes matter much, except insofar as they help us to understand the social causes. And they certainly don't mean that sexual harassment against trans women and sexual harassment against cis women need to be treated differently.   There is variation in sexism, but there is also similarity. Sexism against trans women is similar to sexism against cis women just like sexism against lesbians is similar to sexism against straight women.  experience the same sexism, and now you're saying that some trans women do not face the same the same kinds of discrimination but are equally valid women.  Saying that group X should be included because of Y doesn't mean that people who fail to meet condition Y shouldn't be included. But also I'm talking about different meanings of the word 'woman' here. There's an identity meaning (i.e. if asked 'are you a man or a woman?' what do you respond?) but also a social meaning (do you get treated as a woman by society? (and this may vary in different contexts)). Non-passing trans women *may* fit the former meaning but not the latter. Which means for some analytical purposes it may make more sense not to include them as women, while still making sense to include them as women socially. They are valid women, yet sometimes still not treated as women.  &amp;#x200B;   You can't separate things out like that. This is kind of the point behind intersectionality. Is lesbophobia (discrimination not faced by gay men or straight women) a kind of misogyny or a kind of hatred of gender non-conformity? It's kind of both, because the two are blended together. There are some kinds of sexist harassment that gender non-conforming women face much more than gender-conforming women.  non-conforming people, and that problem is that there is an ongoing    effort to eradicate them from society because they present a threat to    the patriarchy.  The problem of transphobia does largely come down to that. But there are other problems facing trans people too- e.g. trans women face sexism, as I have outlined. There's also the added complexity that transphobia is sometimes about punishing gender non-conformity relative to assigned gender, and sometimes relative to acquired gender.  E.g. it is common for trans women's appearances to be intensively judged, and for trans women to be treated worse for failing to strictly conform to feminity. Some people will say things like 'a *real* woman would never have worn that top with that skirt', and mock them for it, when it would have been deemed unremarkable in a cis woman. This also works as a kind of sexism that specifically affects trans women, showing that things can't always be broken down into just misogyny or hatred of gender non-conformity.   I agree with that. My point was that homophobia often affects gay trans people and gay cis people in the same way, even though by your definition those gay trans people are straight.  &amp;#x200B;  that stuck with them through their transition and detransition.  There are of course cases like that. but I'm talking about what usually happens. Usually someone with a straight boyfriend transitioning from a woman to a man quickly causes them to break up (particularly when medical transition is involved). A non-negligable portion of the time it causes the boyfriend to realise he's bisexual. But cases of fully staight men in relationships with trans men living as men are few and far between. For the most part, people that are attracted to trans men are attracted to men in general.   Some do. But even when they don't at all look like men, most straight men tend not to go for butch women."", ""Part 2:  &amp;#x200B;   1.) It's not just the aspects of gender than specifically treat men better than women that are the problem, but aspects of gender that are just differences, without one group being treated better. When you take that view, everyone is part of the problem. You call people by different words depending on if you view them as men or women, so you're part of the problem to. You probably also interact slightly differently with men and women in other ways. But it is empirically true that many people who use different pronouns for men and women are willing to use pronouns that align with someone's identity.  Importantly for trans people, it is very stigmatised for a woman to get a phalloplasty. But though surgeons commonly won't let women get phalloplasties, they generally will let trans men get them. That is a way that men and women are treated differently where making one's identity clear clearly can change how you are treated (i.e. if you are allowed to get the surgery that will make you feel comfortable with your body). So people who reinforce gender will sometimes listen, and how someone identifies can make an important difference to how they are treated (I have gone for the low-hanging fruit here, but this applies much more broadly).  2.) Regarding someone who identifies as a man as a man is enforcing gender. But so is regarding someone who identifies as a man as a woman. People are going to enforce gender just as much either way, so given that, they should be encouraged to at least enforce a different gender where that would greatly reduce misery. And that doesn't at all prevent also encouraging people to treat people the same regardless of gender. In fact, I think particularly with trans people that aren't close to passing, where it takes a conscious effort to get their gender right, this can make people see how pervasive and arbitrary gender norms are. This helps move in the direction of gender abolition. More broadly, if trans people were widely accepted, the patriarchal justifications for gender roles, which are usually based in biology, would completely fall apart.  &amp;#x200B;   In the same way, the goal is to twist women (my categorisation) into submission. Though this is probably where personifying the patriarchy is more confusing than helpful. There isn't some group of men planning how to oppress women, so there isn't a goal in the literal sense. The 'goal' is the social function it performs for the patriarchy. And the function it performs is to twist women, both trans and cis, to serve men.  It also twists trans men to serve men as women, to the extent that it gets them to perform the role of 'woman' before transitioning (and to the extent that those behavious may linger after transitioning). If anything, it twists trans women more than cis women, as trans women tend to be more harshly sanctioned for not performing femininity. I agree that gender abolition should be the ultimate goal. And I agree that we need to try to reduce how much people are treated differently according to gender here and now. But that doesn't mean we can't also let people move between those gender roles where it will make them less miserable. If you already treated men and women exactly the same, this would require absolutely nothing of you.  &amp;#x200B;   Human sex is bimodally distributed. There are not many people inbetween the two main clusters, but there are some. As such, it makes sense to take that bimodal distribution into accoutn when designing society. But if you design things in a way that excludes people in the middle, you are reinforcing that distinction.  If you have a dating app where people attracted to men select the male sex, the people selecting that will be people attracted to male sexual characteristics. As such, cis men that happen not to fit well with those characteristics (and there will always be some) will not have much success on such an app. As such, men on that app are incentivised to try to make themselves more typically male. E.g. by not shaving or by working out in ways that make their body type more typically male. As such, this app ends up encouraging men to fit themselves into a male ideal- which is recreating a rudimentary form of gender. The same applies to women of course.  &amp;#x200B;  But also, I worry that the conversation is drifting again. How people are treated in a gendered way is a very different question from how people *should* be treated in a gendered way. We both agree that in a first-best world no one would be treated in a gendered way at all. But in a second-best world where gender roles do exist, I would prefer trans people to be treated in line with the gender role they choose, whereas you would prefer them to be treated in line with the gender role they were assigned at birth. The former question is relevant to the latter, but they're obviously not the same.""]"

The same mistakes that happen at post offices happen in voting stations too, it‚Äôs not like suddenly in-person voting is less likely to have clerical errors. The only difference here is that the post office are professionals and the election teams are largely staffed by volunteers with only hours of training. Do the math.  And traditionally, republicans have not been against universal mail-in ballots. They have been against purging voter rolls and voter id laws, but again were fine supporting mail-in voting in states, such as Utah, that have always leaned red. And yes, even Arizona.

They point out potential of fraud but can never point out actual instances of higher fraud, even when given the opportunity to do so in court and in academia. You should probably ask yourself ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù. Why would republicans oppose voting methods that increase voter turnout, are considered safe by even right-leaning institutions that study voting, and whose studies on their efficacy can be read and evaluated in most major scientific publications on the subject. Why would they still refuse to present the evidence when given their literal day in court to make a case, and they do not?  Is it because republicans are a bastion of election integrity, or is it because they‚Äôve found the only method of voting where they still out-pace democrats is Election Day voting?', 'Early voting, and mail-in voting, is no less safe or secure. It just hasn‚Äôt been shown, but feel free to show me studies or investigations where it isn‚Äôt.   And it is changing voting patterns if it drastically has changed from year over year. Maricopa and AZ in general has always had A LOT of mail-in voting over the last elections. You do understand that over 80% of Arizona votes by mail, right? Election Day voting is a vast minority of voting in that state.  I‚Äôm not surprised a Republican push towards Election Day voting caused problems. They haven‚Äôt needed Election Day infrastructure for a while because people were still voting by mail at that high rate when the state was deep red.  It‚Äôs only recently, once republicans began losing control of the state, that mail-in voting was seen as unsafe.

Murder. Rape. Torture. All of which Japan and its people embraced because they felt they *deserved* an empire.  Japan had been preparing for war with the United States for years before Pearl Harbor. They viewed Southeast Asia and the Pacific as part of their rightful sphere of influence and lusted for their natural resources to support their brutal imperialist campaigns in China.  Their defeat in border skirmishes with the Soviets and Mongolians solidified this policy (Nanshin-ron) over trying to conquer Siberia (Hokushin-ron).   The diplomatic moves you mention unfold against the backdrop of a decade of relentless Japanese aggression in Asia and the Pacific. First the unprovoked invasion of China, brutality like the Rape of Nanking, then the conquest of French Indochina and the declaration of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.   The latter two made it clear conflict was inevitable, which is why the US started responding so forcefully to Japan.    No, they knew an attack was coming, but they didn‚Äôt know precisely where or when. There wasn‚Äôt any way to prepare for it beyond generally increasing readiness. In fact, this is why USS *Lexington* wasn‚Äôt at Pearl Harbor; she was delivering aircraft to Midway to strengthen the island‚Äôs defenses.  And you‚Äôre ignoring the simultaneous attacks Japan launched on American territories in the Pacific.

One week later Roosevelt embargoed the export of such grades of oil as still were in commercial flow to Japan.

The US knew these measures would goad Japan into war. In fact, they even knew (because of their breaking Japan\'s cryptographic code), that Japan had planned an attack on Pearl Harbor as their entry into war with the West. They withheld this critical infor\xadmation from the commanders in Hawaii, who might have headed off the attack or prepared themselves to defend against it. Why? Because the impending attack constituted precisely what they had been seeking for a long time. Secretary of War Stimson even wrote in his diaries:  _""The question was how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.‚Äù After the attack, Stim\xadson confessed that ‚Äúmy first feeling was of relief ‚Ä¶ that a crisis had come in a way which would unite all our people._  This is evil, pure and simple.

Most highways are 70mph. I don\'t get what you\'re trying to argue here.   Again, completely wrong.

On your average 55mph highway tho, it\'s definitely more dangerous to be going 80-85mph. On a 70mph highway, going 95-100mph is insane and reckless. I agree that some politicians need to hurry up on updating the speed limits on some rural intrastate highways, but saying that ""25-30mph over the limit"" is a safe rule of thumb is wrong and dangerous.

But the 100 times higher number comes from a Hofstra University researcher who‚Äôs focused on that topic, so let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs true. That‚Äôs where you get to my point about rate vs. absolute number. There are roughly 4 million K-12 teachers in the US, roughly 3.5 million in public schools and 500K in private schools. There are only 35K priests. That‚Äôs 114.3 times as many teachers as priests, so if it‚Äôs 100 times more frequent, priests are abusing at a higher rate than teachers. If there were instead 4 million priests in schools committing the same at their rate, an even higher level of abuse would be occurring.   The point in that article is the media might not be giving enough attention to sexual abuse in schools, which is possibly true. I‚Äôve never heard of any widespread coverups in schools like the Catholic Church did over and over and over by moving priests around with no punishment and allowing more to be victimized. Which ran up to the highest levels of the church, and went on for probably centuries but certainly several decades.   Regardless, the rate of abuse by priests is higher than that of teachers.

Like, what does it even mean to be allied to someone? Would you have considered Britain and France to be allies of Poland in 1939? Even though the USSR did more to materially assist Germany in 1939 and 1940 than the Brits or French did in 1939 to assist Poland or the Czechs.   Not by 1940 no. Trade with the USSR in particular in resources like rubber that the USSR could obtain from Asia is how the Nazis got past the British naval blockade. And this is at the best time to deliver the killer blow to the beast when 3 million men and almost all the aircraft and tanks were committed in the west.   Then why no blow in 1940? Why give nazi Germany the rubber they need for the war machine? Why was the whole red army and air force caught by surprise in June 1941?   Basically the only parties and people in Europe who support Putins invasion of Ukraine are both the far right AND the far left. They do it for very different reasons but they once again converge on supporting proto fascism to own the libs.

And also why Stalin was so complacent with the Nazis once he found a use for them."", 'Edit:   there is no indication for that, the soviets had more home produced trucks than they had american trucks, the land lease itself made up around 10% of their military production, so yes it probably benefitted them somewhat, but it\'s difficult to say if it really helped as they had a large surplus of that equipment in 1945 anyway  The allies giving the Germans czechoslovakia and giving them oil since 1930 did more harm than whatever land lease and soviet-german trade from 1939 onwards. Without all that imported oil the germans would never have achieved their victory spearheaded by concentrated armor in the Battle of France. Without gold and equipment from Czechoslovakia the germans would never have even been able to win the war from 1939-1940 so decisively.  The Soviets traded with the Germans to buy for time, their armed forces were not ready for a decisive invasion of Germany at that point. You are again spreading your western liberal propaganda, trying to act like the west is on a position of imagined moral superiority. In reality in 1939 there was nothing about the British, Americans or French that gave them any kind of ""moral superiority"". They were all vicious and brutal imperialists that massacred thousands and hundreds of thousands of people to feed capital and profit, they were worse than the nazis before 1939 but relatively better (and still very very evil) than the nazis after their genocide in concentration camps, noting of course that the Germans murdered atleast 15 million civilian slavs in the balkans and east.   The Soviet army was not ready for a war with Germany yet. They needed until 1943 to go on the offensive even after the war started in 1941.   I don\'t know, ask them lol. Atleast 20% of oil imports in Germany before the war came from the USA.   Still less than what the allies gave to Germany on a silver platter.   what is a ""workers state"" to you? sounds like an arbitrary and subjective term you invoke without any consistent standards   Mostly different things, but mainly a plot to do a coup and anti-bureaucratism,there were many innocent people who were imprisoned too.   I have heard this lazy and generic line almost a thousand times... from liberals.   I think common ownership for the most part such as industry is beneficial.

So he doesn't count. Where's a prominent leader voted out by the people?   1939 is after 1921 and after 1934, so I dont care. Its besides the point. The Poles were able to send up to 700k troops and the French 3 million. The French leadership turned out to be cowards and lost their country as a result, quite deservingly. The USSR wasn't even necessary to counter the Germans in 1939 had the Western allies put their heart into the 1939 offensive. Fortunately they helped the USSR out a lot with lend lease and strategic bombing campaigns.  Since we're stuck on ww2 for some reason or another let me close with Phillips P. O'Brien in the Journal of Strategic Studies, East versus West in the defeat of Nazi Germany  from the evidence in the survey is that the Second World War in Europe was, economically speaking, an air war. The German war economy was geared, more than anything else, to the construction and supply of aircraft and anti-air weaponry. In the crucial year of 1943, more than 41 per cent of German munitions production was devoted to making aircraft alone.  The next closest area, at a little more than 29 per cent, was ammunition, followed by naval vessels at 8.43 per cent, weapons (from anti-aircraft guns to artillery pieces to small arms) at 8.02 per cent, motor vehicles at 4.08 per cent, and halftracks at 1.78 per cent. The production of Panzers, considered the queen of the battlefields on the Eastern Front, took up only 6.27 per cent of German war production. In other words tank production took up only three-quarters as much of German production as naval construction, and less than one-sixth as much of German production as aircraft building. The domination of aircraft production continued for the rest of the war. In 1944 the percentage of the German economy devoted to building planes rose and in July of that year, when overall German munitions production reached its peak, over 48 per cent of German war production was aircraft. A further way of measuring the importance of aircraft production within the framework of the German economy can be seen not only by measuring the value of product assigned to each combatant service, but in the allocation of the German workforce. In a speech given by Albert Speer in August 1944, the Reichminister stated that even after the enormous relative increases in tank and self-propelled gun production achieved since early 1943, aircraft production still occupied far more workers than any other single part of the German war economy.   At that time more than 2,100,000 workers were involved in aircraft production while only 1,900,000 were involved in all army production, and 500,000 were employed by the navy. The preeminence of aircraft construction in economic production should lead to a reevaluation of how exactly Germany was defeated. This can best be done by looking at 1943, a year which is often seen as the turning point of the Second World War in Europe. The year 1943 is crucial for several reasons. In 1939 and 1940 the Germans were primarily occupied fighting the West, while in 1941 and 1942 the war against Russia received the highest priority. In 1943, however, the Germans came under attack from both sides. It was the year that saw the great Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk, victories that ended the possibility of any further German strategic offensives on the Eastern Front. In the West, 1943 was when the British and Americans launched their invasions of Sicily and Italy, and began the first large-scale strategic bombing campaign against Germany. Thus, 1943 is also regularly used by those who like to minimise the West's contribution to the defeat of Germany. Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk are thus described as vital steps in the defeat of Germany, while the Anglo-American strategic bombing offensive is usually denigrated. The year 1943 is also important because it was the first year during which German armaments production began to expand dramatically. German war production, as is widely known, was surprisingly limited during the first years of the Second World War. Inefficient utilisation of economic resources in 1939, 1940, and 1941 led to only marginal increases. Between the beginning of 1940 and the end of 1941, total German armament production hardly increased at all.16  In almost every area of weaponry Germany was actually outproduced, in quantity if not in quality, by its opponents before 1943. From this point on home defense received the lion's share of new German production. By 1 January 1944, over 54 per cent of all Luftwaffe operational front-line aircraft strength was in Germany or the West resisting the bomber offensive, with an additional 10 per cent in the Mediterranean and approximately 35 per cent on the Eastern Front.  This kind of deployment would continue for much of the rest of the war. At the same time that the West was soaking up more and more German air resources, it was destroying proportionally more and more as well. Air combat for the Luftwaffe was always more dangerous against the British and Americans than against the Russians. The technological inferiority of the Soviets led to a considerably smaller percentage of German losses on the Eastern Front, even when the Luftwaffe was greatly outnumbered by the Red Air Force. As a point of comparison 3,936 German planes were lost fighting the British and American air forces in the Mediterranean between January and November 1943, while only 3,773 aircraft were lost on the Eastern Front.  When one adds the even larger figure of 4,225 aircraft lost in either Western Europe or the defense of the Reich in the same period, it becomes clear that the British and Americans played by far the largest role in tying down and destroying the German air force in 1943. In percentage terms about 68.5 per cent of all German losses were caused by the British and Americans and the remaining 31.5 per cent by the Russians. These increased losses are extremely important because 1943, as said above, was a year in which German aircraft production leapt markedly. Almost all of this increase occurred in fighter construction. In 1943 the Germans built 10,898 fighters compared to 5,515 the year before.39 However, the Germans were unable to reap any advantage from this extremely large production increase because it was almost all diverted or destroyed by the even larger effort put forward by the Western Allies. Instead of being able to overwhelm the technologically-inferior Russian Air Force on the Eastern Front, the Luftwaffe saw its newest and most professional units continually ground down over Germany's own skies. Again, when one compares the allocation of German fighters at the beginning and the end of 1943 the importance of the West stands out clearly. In January 1943 1,045 single-engine and twin-engine fighters were based in the West running from Norway to Germany into France. At the same time280 fighters were based in the Mediterranean and Balkans, and 445 were fighting in Russia. By 1 January 1944 the number of German fighters in the West had grown by 605 to 1,650, while the corresponding figures for the Mediterranean had grown by 85 to 365 and that for the Eastern Front had actually dropped by 20 to 425.

While you can‚Äôt stop every incident, you‚Äôre not powerless. Follow these 10 common sense steps to make your business a harder target and help you deal with shoplifters more safely.  1) Keep your store adequately staffed. An empty store is an invitation to a shoplifter.   2-10)  Keep your store clean inside and out, organized, and well-lit. A messy and disorganized store can make it easy to steal without being spotted. Use dome mirrors overhead to better observe activity throughout your store. Consider installing Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) to be your ‚Äúeye-in-the-sky‚Äù over high-theft items. Block off cash register lanes not in use to make it harder for a shoplifter to exit without paying. Use ‚Äúassertive hospitality.‚Äù Train your employees to routinely walk the aisles, making eye contact and greeting each shopper with a friendly, ‚ÄúCan I help you find something?‚Äù Be aware of red flags and common target areas for shoplifters. Extra baggy or multi-layered clothes, a nervous demeanor, extra bags, or excessive people watching may be signs of a shoplifter. Be aware of high target items such as cigarettes, meat, and batteries. Watch for open merchandise during checkout and immediately offer to get a replacement item for the customer. Use extreme caution when stopping a shoplifter. The wrong decision could result in injury or death of an employee or customer and/or a costly liability suit. Train your staff thoroughly. You can only legally stop a shoplifter if someone has watched the suspect continuously, observed him or her enter the aisle or section, pick up the item, conceal the item, and attempt to leave the store without purchasing the item. Call police immediately and prosecute. When police arrive, report how you‚Äôve followed the legal requirements above, and follow through with prosecution to show the community and shoplifters that you won‚Äôt tolerate the crime.‚Äù  https://www.riskpointins.com/10-ways-to-deter-shoplifting-at-your-retail-store/', 'r/shoplifting used to do that for me.']

But I agree, not everything that Kendi puts forward is a good idea  As an example, it is accepted within the academia that minority groups are disproportionally targeted for stops, arrests, and also receive harsher sentences on average. (Whether you want to call this systemic racism or systematic racism is a different discussion). Also, pulling from the words of the Supreme Court, segregated schools made them separate and inherently unequal. These are quantifiable instances of discrimination against minority groups and this past discrimination has ramifications that have lead us to our present.   Kendi says that the remedy for past discrimination, is present discrimination. That in order to undo the damage that past discrimination has caused, present discrimination is necessary. This line of thinking typically runs afoul of America\'s accepted ""no discrimination"" ethos. I have a hard time accepting this as a way forward.   However it does bring up the point that injustices have occured and have negatively impacted people, families, and communities based on little more than their race/skin color/culture. Kendi does not put forward this question on his own, but it is a question that is found at the top end of the literature. The question is ""Do we as Americans have a responsibility to ensure other Americans receive help when injustices are done to some people?"" I imagine the question Kendi would put forward is ""Should we as Americans discriminate and give help to those who have been discriminated against by our systems? (police, courts, government policy)""', ""I'll go through the items on that list, starting in 2000.   Ruthless, but attacking an organization that goes against your business interests is not racist.   I don't see anything racist about Trump's statement. He fired him for not performing to the level he'd expect from someone with that level of education. Seems reasonable.   Stupid and toxic idea, but not all that uncommon. This is basically every episode of Family Fued and I haven't seen anyone call Steve Harvey racist   Yeah, the Ground Zero Mosque was an abhorrent idea and opposing it was not racist.   Another stupid idea that I don't think is racist. He pushed the same thing for Ted Cruz.   Trump has bashed every candidate he's ever run against in similar ways. It doesn't suddenly become racist when the guy he does it against is black.   Not really racist. If a judge was a member of a white lawyers association every Democrat would jump on the opportunity to eviscerate them for it. No different here.   This is funny and not at all racist. He's making fun of a white woman for pretending to be a different heritage to game the system.   Law and order is not racism and it's bad faith to claim otherwise   Another stupid, poorly thought out statement, but clearly not meant in a hateful way.   Also stupid but not racist.   Criticizing people who disrespect our nation and soldiers is not racist.   Nothing wrong with calling it the Chinese virus as it originated in China. No different than something like the Spanish flu   Again, he attacks everyone he runs against. It doesn't suddenly become racist when they are a person of color.  Some of that stuff is legitimately racist though. The Muslim ban and the Haiti comments in particular were pretty rough - I had forgotten about the Muslim ban and had not heard the Haiti comments.""]"

When in fact as of September 2022 less than 4% of US adults were up to date on their Covid shots - along with 3.5% of children had even been vaccinated at all.  So does the virus only mutate and kill the parents and grandparents of the children of those who support the GOP?  Also, isn‚Äôt it true there was no study done that proves the vaccines slow transmission? Let alone a scientifically peer reviewed study? Which contradicts what we were originally told my experts, media heads and politicians.  This is a divisive and dangerous article as it leads to finger point over political beliefs vs scientific evidence. To suggest that 3,000 republicans are dying per day because they‚Äôre not getting vaccinated, and then to blame them for a natural spreading virus is not only inaccurate but I would say unethical, dangerous and not helpful. And also not backed by any peer reviewed science.  Maybe the conversation should be more along the lines of where did medical and health experts paired with politicians fail to gain the trust of society by not being transparent and attempting to force people into making decisions about their health they weren‚Äôt comfortable making. And there is bi-partisan blame on this issue. The virus was politicized by both sides.. don‚Äôt forget Biden and Harris both said they wouldn‚Äôt get ‚Äútrumps‚Äù vaccine (which it‚Äôs not Trumps..) but this is why you see the vaccination rate low.', ""I think it would have happened no matter who was in charge, it was a hot issue...but positions shifted rapidly. You can see Kamala throwing shade at Trump's vaccine in her debate(her words, not mine), but after Trump was out, the Democrats became full throated vaccine advocates.   Trump was a vaccine fan from day one, but even his supporters sometimes forget that. Operation Light Speed was his baby...the party in power likes having power, and hates losing it.  If Trump had won in 2020 and gone ahead with a full vaccine mandate, Democrats would be side by side with us Libertarians against mandates, wailing about the evil fascism of Trump."", 'So am I. Trump being the first general antivaxx candidate primed Republicans going antivaxx generally and specifically with Covid. He gave antivaxx conspiracy theorists a whole party to tap into. That caused covid death. Sure, Trump wanted to take credit for the vaccine, but his previous antivaxx stances and ongoing backing of conspiracies was at net win for the antivaxx movement.   His vaccine support was always mixed, conspiracy filled, and he dropped it immediately after getting booed at a rally. His above general antivaxx backing is what lead to the ""Boos.""  Before Trump, Right Wing talking heads, like Tucker, saw the antivaxx movement as something to make fun of liberals for, "" those dumb, hippy liberals in San Francisco had a measles outbreak!"" Trump saw antivaxx as an opportunity to gain Republican voters , as both parties ignored them. Trump pulled them into the Republican Party and now talking heads like Tucker on the right have flipped on vaccines. Trump lead the way on that. And, he is responsible for antivaxx spreading throughout the Republican party.']"

""Market value"". If Netflix gives you just enough options to not cancel, then it is appropriately priced for its options. If your work is sufficient to ensure your employer continues the relationship, your labor is appropriate.  If your employer raises your wages, it then has every right to expect more. Just as if an employee pushes beyond that, that employee has every right to expect greater compensation.  Only problem is, employees that work harder, in the overwhelming majority of cases, cannot expect that extra labor to be fairly compensated.   A good employee only belongs with a good employer. For all the talk about what an employee must do to be worthy, few ever consider what an employer must do. Out of every employer I have had, and everybody I have asked, I can count the number of good employers I have heard of on zero fingers. If an employer advocates or works to prevent union formation, it is a bad employer. If an employer\'s minimum annual raise doesn\'t match the inflation rate, it is a bad employer.  So the question is... why do bad employers deserve those mythical \'good employees\'. When someone goes above and beyond for someone else that exploits them, the descriptor I would.use for such a person isn\'t ""good"", but rather, ""naive"".   For every person paid well by employers, 1000 are paid unfathomably low. So, while it is literally true that most employers pay *people* well, the corollary is that the number of people paid well is almost always fewer than 1% of those employed.   \'for the amount we are willing to pay.\'  That\'s the unspoken last part of your sentence. Your argument is not far off from ""but nobody wants to work anymore."" The full sentence.is ""nobody wants to work anymore for the slave wages we offer"".  Employers are largely paying D- wages and expecting A- employees. And the workforce is waking up to the fact that the picture you are painting is a fantasy for most. A pleasant fiction, with little basis in fact or truth.', ' And what is *actually* true is everything before ""which will lead to you getting better compensated."" Which is why it is unwise to ""do a better job"" when you\'re getting paid ""adequate job"" wages. If an employer wishes for you to do a better job, then they should include compensation for increased performance in your work agreement. If they do not, they are attempting to get the deluxe car wash after paying for the economy. That is wage theft.  ""Hey, give me the value meal for the price of a burger for a year, and hopefully I will start paying you more later.""  In *any other context*, such an arrangement would be considered an idiotic bargain, only accepted by the most naive.  But somehow, the working class has been brainwashed for.a century to accept this notion that they have a burden to prove worthy of pay before getting it, while business needn\'t prove worthy of quality work before expecting it. It is the height of entitlement. And it is exploitation. That is the status quo.   Tell me how many ""feel better about your job"" are needed to pay a car note? Is that about the same exchange rate as being paid in exposure?  You know what\'s a huge bonus? An agreement to pay a huge bonus for exceptional work. You know what isn\'t a huge bonus? Non monetary compensation. Because until a company lets me buy their widgets with job satisfaction, it has no business being in a discussion on fair compensation.   And there\'s nothing that says that everyone in the country can\'t be a millionaire. But it doesn\'t reflect reality. Appropriate salaries are things employers avoid paying as much as possible, which is why 50 years ago, the bottom 50% of earners controlled 20% of the wealth, and today, that group controls 2% of it.  Money is consistently and uniformly being funnelled away from the working class to the oligarchy. So I suppose the only people that say you can\'t get paid an appropriate salary are the people responsible for paying salaries.  The notion of surviving on job satisfaction while waiting for employers to come around on pay is possibly the most naive thing I have read today.  You can love your job. 100% support that. There are benefits for the employer and employee. *But none of those benefits should be work that is valued above what an employer is paying for.*  You can hate your job and still do it. Not my business. *But your dissatisfaction should not lead you to provide work valued below what your employer is paying for.*  In other words, job satisfaction should have no relevance, at all, to the value of the labor you provide. The only thing that should be relevant to the value of the work provided is the value of the compensation for it. Period.   Any advocacy for an increased amount of value provided, above what is paid for? Is advocacy for the exploitation of workers. You are advocating worker exploitation, despite the lip service you occasionally throw to ""that\'s wrong, but still love your job and your employer who is underpaying you and work reeeeeealllly hard so that one day, you might get noticed and rewarded, if you\'re really lucky. I mean, yeah it\'s wrong, but my message is basically to shut up, love your job, and take it.""  That\'s the message you communicate when you levy zero accountability to employers. Which is exactly the level you are levying.  This CMV is not on the benefits of job satisfaction. It is on the acceptability of providing labor exclusively based on the monetary compensation provided. My arguments are about providing labor exclusively based on the monetary compensation. Your argument is a nebulous red herring about whether or not people that like their job work harder.  It is off topic and irrelevant to the CMV.', ' I get your point. I do. It is as true as it is irrelevant.  If someone who enjoys their job.does better work because they enjoy their job, even without additional compensation, they are incentivizing an employer to exploit them.  It is fine to like your job. There are a whole host of benefits for the employer and employee. Healthier work environment and better job satisfaction are two.  But one that should never, ever, *ever* be an employer benefit is ""better quality work"". Because you liking your job is not relevant to the work you do. Or more appropriately, if the only way you will attain a fair work level is if you love your job, *you\'re a bad employee*. If you\'re a good employee, giving fair labor already, and you do more because you love your job, then every day you are not compensated for that, your employer is demonstrating that they are a bad employer.  ""Loving your job"" should have zero impact on the quality of your work. If it does, it points to the likelihood that the employee has poor willpower and self motivation, which are not  \'good employee\' traits.  I get your point. I understand it. *It just doesn\'t accurately reflect truth*.  Your employer is entitled to a fair day of your work for a fair wage.  You are entitled to fair compensation for all work you do.  Employers have been consistently failing to meet their obligations, resulting in the consequence that any employee that does being exploited.  Before you talk about being a good employee, show me a single example of a good employer, that employs over 500 people.']"

Steve Bannon and John Kasich were sources for two stories in 2016 about the campaign\'s VP search which apparently was  promising the VP would be in charge of domestic and foreign policy while Trump would be in charge of ""making America great again"". This is obviously not what we got, because even Trump\'s own inner circle failed to understand the totality of Trump\'s narcissism. It would be intolerable for Trump to be aware of someone else really being in charge and especially for anyone else to be aware of it. It\'s one way George W. Bush looks reasonable by comparison, that candidate and president-elect Bush understood the practical and political benefit of making it known that he was going to be surrounded by people more experienced than himself. Trump wants everyone to think he\'s a genius who is surrounded by lackeys who praise his genius.']"

I'm saying there's nothing about the Electoral College that systematically favors rural voters.

I accredited lower violence to changes in income, poverty, health, etc. These things ALSO affect gun ownership rates.  So gun ownership rates increase homicide rates by a smaller amount than income, health, etc. decrease homicide rates.', 'Tying suicide rate to firearms is silly.  U.S. suicide rate has dropped slightly since 1990, and has similar suicide rate to many European countries  In regard to homicide, the rate varies *a lot* by state and location within the state.  So it isn‚Äôt accurate to say that guns are causing the homicides - some areas with little restriction on gun ownership have low homicide rates, while others have hight homicide rates.', 'Your source is linking firearm deaths to gun control laws. Now, as I mentioned above, suicide rates do have some correlation, but only due to firearm suicides being more likely to succeed. I also mentioned a lack of correlation between homicide rates and gun control laws. Your source is limiting the scope to firearm related deaths only. Now, I don\'t know about you, but I would like to reduce homicide as a whole, and not just reduce the number of homicides committed by a specific implement. The claims your source is making are the scientific equivalent of ""there are more drowning deaths in Hawaii than the Sahara Desert."" The claim is technically true, but completely worthless. The reason it\'s worthless is that reducing the firearm homicide rate does not necessarily reduce the homicide rate.      Let\'s take two cities with equal populations. They each have 100 homicides every year, making their homicide rate the same. One city has 100 firearm homicides, the other has 100 knife homicides. Which city is safer? Does the fact that the second city has zero firearm homicides mean it\'s a safer place to live? If you could reduce the number of firearm homicides in the first city to zero, but it came with an increase of 100 knife homicides the next year, did you actually make any sort of difference? No, of course not; your chance of being killed in either city is exactly the same. This is why ""firearm death"" is generally not a useful statistic.      You can verify the above information by looking at the [FBI Uniform Crime Report](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-4). Sorry I can\'t link you to the latest information directly, because the FBI redesigned their UCR website and it\'s no longer possible (as far as I can tell) to pull a table of the violent crime rates by state, though you can use the dropdown to look at specific states [here](https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend) and compare the numbers yourself. What you will find is states that Giffords rates highest are present at both ends of the spectrum on violent crime rates and states with terrible ratings are also present at both ends. In other words, there just isn\'t a correlation there. I would also like to point out that the Center for American Progress is strongly biased towards the left, and it\'s citing numbers from gun control advocacy groups, which would be the equivalent of me citing the NRA to debunk them (which you will note, I refrained from doing because the NRA is also a completely biased source). I recommend you try to locate some higher quality sources for your citations, and maybe examine the sources you currently have to verify they are accurate and trustworthy.']"

You saying so does not make it so. Everything I wrote was correct, although it could be further expounded upon to provide more clarity. Furthermore, nothing I wrote contradicted itself, so I don't know were this idea is from.   I should have been more clear, I was talking about the slums you see in most of Africa and Asia, especially in India. Nobody actually owns the land the slums are on in any official or legal sense, nobody holds title to the land. What this means is that a person cannot seek any legal recourse for theft or damage, nor will anybody be punished for infringing on what the people own. This is why you see shacks built on top of or touching the shacks of others. A person cannot stop another from building on top of them or touching them, since they do not own their land. People cannot build nice homes or apartments in these places because they hold no title to land, meaning that it will be taken over by squatters before they can plan and construct something other than a basic shack. People cannot provide utilities to their homes for the same reason, having title means people tap into your power, water, sewage, etc. and you would have no legal recourse. There can be no planning and organization and vision for this area, since no land is secure and stable.   This is just not so. Capitalism is a system that recognizes private property and respects it, unfortunately, in many places there is no respect for private property and no protections for it, as in the case of the slums, where people have no legal or official title to land. Nobody recognizes the ownership of the land. There is a movement to help people in 3rd world countries get legal title to their lands so that they can seek recourse and protection, which is a great development."", ' There\'s no such thing as ""the owner"", nor is land being sold against anybody\'s will. Empty land has no owner, by every legal definition it reverts to the public or the commons after years of disuse or having never been used. This is the fundamental problem: capitalist ideology propagates disinformation, as if there\'s existential squares written on a map somewhere by political sanctity.  Ownership is a broad spectrum of Rights receding and proceeding over time, the only issue are ""claims"" when it comes up in the judicial system. The state does not actually sell land, it sells deeds and titles. Land is just the surface of the earth and it doesn\'t move.  Here\'s an example of the contradiction:   Of course they do, ownership is established by law everywhere in the occupancy of land.   They do hold title to the land, hence the effort to formalize that as you mentioned later.   That\'s because their government is weak, and doesn\'t have any normal means to prosecute what you\'ve just described. It\'s not because of lacking some weirdly existential ""title"". By any normal customary use of land, each shack has a ""curtilage"" which extends the zone of dominion from the structure etc.  You\'re telling me that free concerts when people put down their blankets, it\'s normal to edge my space right up to yours and intrude on your enjoyment. It\'s definitely NOT normal, and concertgoers tend to complain to each other if somebody was parked too close.   If we live in a culture that\'s founded on disrespect and nobody cares, then it might look like a third world slum. You need a magical fetish to ""make"" it be title, even though all titles derive from possession at some point.    There\'s rowhouses and apartment dwellings in every modern city, but I doubt you\'d question the title of real estate in that instance.   That is completely wrong, people are not assigned the existential ownership of land in any case. You believe in a false god here, called ""deed trespassing"". All trespass consists of invading actual space or constructively belonging to another. The development of slums in the third world is happening according to the customary standard of that area, and it would be the same if legal title was recognized to build row houses and condos. Everything would touch, and get built right on top of each other like in every other Urban environment.   Notice you cannot define that property, which doesn\'t appear to be private either. I\'m talking about constant sales of land, which results in the development of vacant areas or their reversion to public use. All titles are subject to all other claims anyway, so it\'s just a method of selling off the public domain.  That\'s how tax sales work, there\'s no guarantee that deed has any efficacy or merchantability for any purpose. It\'s just selling off the potential of state dominion, and then you have to work it out in the Civil environment. The land described may not even exist, and this is publicly disclaimed by every tax authority.   Of course they do, it\'s all context to the environment.', "" This was my misunderstanding then. I thought you were talking about reselling all land, not just vacant lands.      Nobody actually owns the land the slums are on in any official or legal sense        Of course they do, ownership is established by law everywhere in the occupancy of land.  This is not a contradiction. In much of the world, people are technically living on land illegally, as much of the land is owned by the government or has no official claim, which is why governments routinely engage in slum clearing operations, bulldozing the slums or why they can forcibly relocate these people. Furthermore, a large number of people cannot go to court to defend their property or seek protection from the government because they don't have legal ownership. Governments don't recognize the property of hundreds of millions of people around the world, meaning they don't legally own the land.      They do hold title to the land, hence the effort to formalize that as you mentioned later.  People actually do not hold title to the land the live on in much of the world. It is simple and easy to look this up. In many of the poorest countries, almost all land is owned by the government, with large populations technically being squatters. Only about 30% of the population worldwide has actual title to their lands. There is a reason there is constant conflict over land in places like Africa, there is a reason people don't invest in their property, it is because they hold no legal title.   I am not talking about hypotheticals from countries with property rights, I am talking about actual practices around the world, where private property is rare and protections are weak.      There's rowhouses and apartment dwellings in every modern city, but I doubt you'd question the title of real estate in that instance.  This is completely different and has nothing to do with what I was talking about, therefore irrelevant.   Townhouses and Row houses are very different from slums and are able to be developed because of private ownership of land. It should be obvious the differences between a slum with no property ownership and a townhouse or row house and how these come to be developed.    I don't think you understand how property works. Simply living on land does not make it yours. Having title to land certifies that it is yours and allows you to legally force someone off your land and gives you the right to go to court to protect land since you have proof that it is yours.""]"

SWAT was in a standoff for hours before flashbanging the place.  When they saw smoke, they sent in a robot to retrieve the munitions before it ignited, but the gunman interfered.  When the fire started, the SWAT team called the Fire department in and had to shield the firefighters to prevent the gunman from shooting them.  Eventually the gunman ran out to escape the fire - and THEN he let SWAT know that his younger brother was still in there.  The younger brother died from smoke inhalation."", 'And how would the cops know that from their vehicles mid drive at approximately 30 yards with half his body concealed with what would appear to be an AR on his person shooting into a home?  It‚Äôs like y‚Äôall forget you‚Äôre watching a video and have full access to the situation after it happened - the cops obviously had no clue who he was, and before this gets flipped to ‚Äúu bOoT LicKeR‚Äù my earlier comment was that they both made bad decisions full stop.  Cop shot too fast, and we don‚Äôt know the whole situation that transpired to the guySHOOTING INTO HIS OWN HOUSE FROM THE FRONT DOOR.  There are so many questions - for me the main one being if he made it outside with an AR why is he still blindly shooting into his home??  Did he grab the AR and leave ?? If so he presumably also had the chance to move to a safer position. If he didn‚Äôt why would you have the AR and go into a situation like you‚Äôre swat - if he had a family member home then fine I guess his choice - but I‚Äôm not blindly firing an AR into my house if there is family in there.  This isn‚Äôt even a anti gun thing, if I was in that situation I‚Äôm staying in my house with my AR and I will defend my life, I‚Äôm not goi g to haphazardly run outside and shoot into my own house with cameras everywhere in front of Gods country that‚Äôs just stupid ESPECIALLY carrying an AR and shooting KNOWING the cops are on the way!  This is all just common sense-  don‚Äôt fuck yourself legally while protecting your property', 'This is a two fold issue. Policy is a major part of it, and fuckin coward ass officers are the second.  The call that prompted the officer response was an open structure call. Neighbor called in said, "" hey, their front door has been open all day, can you go and do like a welfare check on them. That seems kinda odd to me""  What policy is, is to respond as if it is a burglary in progress, and this is what was relayed to the officers. So for a fairly minor call, these officers are expecting a fight.  They get there, don\'t knock, don\'t do anything except try to gather info. The shooting officer goes around to the back of the house. Banging a gate, flashlight out and on, and now the home owner watching her nephew grabs her piece. Because it sounds like there\'s someone out back and she\'s got a kid to protect, good on her.  Officer looks through a window and starts yelling commands. Shoots well before there\'s an opportunity to respond.  Now idk about you, but when I look through my windows at night, I can\'t see out for shit. But seeing in is totally easy. So fucking imagine being that home owner. She did the right thing and got blasted because some pussy bitch officer couldn\'t handle himself and consider the circumstances for literally 4 seconds before dropping this lady. She had no information, nothing to respond to, no way of seeing the police, and even if she did, no way to identify them as police, and she was killed for the transgression of defending herself and her nephew from the threat outside.  Put the cop out back, have another bang on the door, scream police open up.  If it\'s burglars, sure you may have a fight or a barricaded suspect. But dealing with that is the job you signed up for. Killing law abiding people because you\'re scared, that just makes me angrier that he didn\'t get more time.  Granted there was no way he was gonna get murder. Reckless Manslaughter is a bit of a legal stretch, but what\'s clear is that the jury saw the outcome, said yeah fuck this guy, the charge may not fit but fuck you go to jail.']"

Easy to sneer when you aren't in the firing line as millions come through unannounced each year. As I said, libs get 17,000 unannounced migrants in the richest city in America, NYC, and Adams screams in terror that it's an emergency and he needs federal funding. Texas gets anywhere between 2.4 -3. million in a year, and the lib response is some self-serving crap about how the state should just deal with it.   You also seem to have ignored the point I made, so here it is again - you are seeing what you want to see regarding Texas and its appeals for help, which the state has been making for decades, at all levels. The lib response has been ignorance and derision.   In the interval, they are doing the best they can. And in the meantime, a couple of busloads of migrants arriving (by choice) at Kamala Harris' residence while the state focuses on sheltering as many migrants as it can, has provoked howls of outrage from those same libs. How dare you, think of the children, etc. You can deny it all you want, your side's core message is 'migrants are your problem, how dare you make it ours!?'   Aye, and you have the gentle sound of angry screeching from CNN and MSNBC hosts to lull you to sleep as well. At least you hypocrites are listening now - makes a nice change, and a few thousand more at Martha's Vineyard next year might also get you NIMBYs to do something about Texas' pleas for help."", "" Yeah, I know - this entire thread is you seeing exactly what you want to see, no more. You don't see the tens of thousands of migrants Texas houses in one of the nation's largest shelter networks, the desperate appeals by everyone from mayors to state legislators to Abbott himself for help, the pleas by Texas to stop encouraging migrants to cross for years now.  Texas is full. 53,000 migrants arrived at El Paso alone in October, 2.4 million across the border this year. When Title 42 ends,  hundreds of thousands will arrive without fear of deportation, monthly.  Texas deals with shit you hypocrites can't even imagine. 17,000 people arrived over a year in NYC and Adams declares an emergency and screams for federal funding. Texas sees 100 times that every year, and has been asking for help for years - but you people prefer virtue-signalling, and you in particular prefer to ignore everything Texas is saying because truth be told, pointing out that you and your side are shameless hypocrites is painful to hear.   Well, you want open borders, you got them. Here's just a couple hundred people who willingly choose to get on a bus to DC - and rich libs have a meltdown screaming about Texas not showing any empathy and compassion.  What you mean by ' empathy and compassion' is 'deal with this shit so I don't have to'. Sorry bud - time to live what you demand Texas submits to. Share the burden, it's Christmas after all - all Texas is doing is pointing it out to you, and in the process not letting migrants freeze. 'Cynical political stunt'? Only in the eyes of lib hypocrites outraged at being called out on their bullshit."", "" 'Stop lying', he says, while confidently asserting that NY is in fact asking for $3B to deal with migrants, not the...$3B I stated.  You keep using that word, lying - I'm not sure it means what you think it means, bud.    I know, that's exactly my point. Migrants? That's for those darn Texans to deal with. What!? How dare you send migrants up here?!? We don't deal with refugees, that's *your* job! Help, emergency!  Virtue signalling is cheap when it's on someone else's dime, but that is 99% of the Dem platform.    Boo hoo. Texas deals with 3 million a year - 1/100th that number sending NYC crying and screaming to the feds over an emergency that needs billions to fix just shows you how comfortable you libs got in leaving migrants to Texas to handle. Too bad that grift's ending.    'Let them all in' is not taking border security seriously - no wonder Republicans aren't signing on for that nonsense.   Title 42 staunched a tidal wave that is now descending on Texas - it is the quickest, best solution to the problem, pending the Dems getting their heads out of their asses. Much like the Migrant Protection Protocols, which are another tool for the problem the Dems are trying to kill.    Had zero warning. I still don't think you or any of the other virtue-signalling Dems get just how bad this wave is. FY 2021-2022 saw 2.76 million border crossings in Texas, a record high that was *1 million above* 2020-2021, which in itself was a record high. Border crossings have skyrocketed since Biden took office to levels Texas could not anticipate or deal with. It has spent $4B of Texans' money to try to do the feds job in containing this gigantic influx (not counting the additional billions spent to feed, house and clothe migrants) but there are limits to its patience.   Good, so DC and NY should shut the fuck up then. Deal with these problems you didn't ask for.   The crisis has nothing to do with incompetence or Texas - as I said to someone else, if you let Texas handle border security, they wouldn't complain, but you probably wouldn't like the result. The problem is that you libs expect Texas to deal with your mess in terms of the migrants you encourage to hop the border into the United States through wilfully ending Title 42, ending the MSPs, and virtue signalling about illegal migration. On Texas' dime, at the cost of Texas' overloaded social services and infrastructure.  Texas has decided to export your hobby horses directly to you. Not even all of them, just a tiny number that willingly choose to go to DC/NYC. And for this tiny number, you folks cry, wail, mald and seethe.  Good. Finally you're listening.""]"

This one happened way back when all the continents were still connected and it‚Äôs apparently connected to some massive volcanic activity and global warming as the frozen methane under the ocean had melted and caused a runaway warming effect.

They literally have a proportionate amount of representation.   And it wouldn‚Äôt create any power ‚Äúimbalance‚Äù to elect the president by a popular vote. Every American would be exactly equal. But I gather you think that‚Äôs the problem? I mean, ok. But there‚Äôs no particular reason we‚Äôd have to change anything else about our federal system if we switched to a popular vote. You think there‚Äôd have to be some other change to prevent Americans from having a more equal voice in their government? I don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôd be necessary.   And also, the real problem with the Electoral College isn‚Äôt a slight bias to small states. Most small states are totally irrelevant to the outcome. No one cares about voters in Montana because they won‚Äôt affect the outcome. The problem is it‚Äôs winner-take-all in almost all states, and as a result, only a handful of swing states really matter. Imagine we kept electoral votes the same, but awarded them proportionally (and it could be awarded in fractions of a vote, to the millionth decimal place or something like that), that would solve most of the problems of the Electoral College. But at that point, you really might as well just have a popular vote.', "" I just want to point out this is a meaningless idea and possible quite wrong.  We have *never* had a single nationwide popular vote election in the US for President. There is zero reason to assume you can take vote totals for an electoral college election, which is really just statewide popular vote elections to allocate state electors, and claim those votes would be representative for a true popular vote election nationwide.  We know voter behavior and campaign behavior would be different in a popular vote election.  Why would you expect the vote totals to be the same as the electoral college election?  Along those same lines, the claim of a vote being worth different amounts is equally wrong. Your vote in California for president is worth the exact same as every other vote in California for president. You only get a say in how California allocates it's electoral votes. You vote in California has NO bearing on what Wyoming does. A voter in Wyoming's vote is exactly equal to every other voter in Wyoming and totally worthless in California. A voter is voting as a resident of a STATE first and foremost. That state then in turns allocated votes for the President.   People like to through these two statements around as if they have meaning. They don't and they are specifically designed to misinform people and generate an emotional response."", 'The same system causes both. Because it\'s winner-takes-all for electoral college votes, states with clear majorities are worthless to campaign within regardless of their population, so every candidate spends most of their time and effort on the states that are actually undecided. Only about 10 states are considered reasonably likely to flip, and of those only about 2 end up actually close enough to matter in any particular election. Moving such a state by 2% can shift the election by an entire state worth of votes as a result.  However, electoral college votes are not assigned to states purely by population. There\'s a population-based amount, then they get an extra 2 as bonus on top. And it happens to be that the low population states almost universally end up going to the same party every election, giving that party additional electoral votes relative to their popular vote.  In other words, there isn\'t some big ""gotcha"" moment here like you seem to think there is. That ""contradiction"" you seem to be implying is exactly how the electoral college works and what it results in, and that\'s why people don\'t like it.  Switching to popular vote not only prevents unpopular candidates from winning by manipulating the system, it also means that *every* state must receive attention because every vote shifted matters no matter where it is, rather than having 40/50 states not matter at all to presidential candidates.']"

Read the dental literature, there isn't a treatment out there whether chemical or using certain frequencies of light that can fully sterilise the root canal system. This means bacteria remain indefinitely. I could go on about the basic structure of a tooth. Most are far more complex with lateral and accessory canals than you would imagine, making mechanical removal and filling of these areas basically impossible. But even if these didn't exist we know anaerobic bacteria grow inside the tubules, and each tooth has millions of these. Anaerobic bacteria are on the order of 1000 times more toxic than aerobic.

In your example it would be more like a limb ~~loosing~~ losing both its nerve connection to the brain as well as its blood supply.  Effectively making it a dead limb that would need to be cut off.  I\'m not saying a dead tooth needs to be removed, especially after receiving a root canal, but a dead tooth is actually dead.', ' Should we compare it to the bones inside their limbs if those bones loose their blood supply?

The blood supply and nerves to the tooth is cut off and that\'s why they call it a dead tooth.  Arguing otherwise is fairly pointless, as it is a well established term throughout the dental community to refer to a tooth that has lost its nerves and blood supply.      I do not know where I made such a belief known, and in fact stated I don\'t think a dead tooth should be removed. Specifically for the reasons you listed making it still very functional.

What about past events? What can natural selection predict with the evolution of the long neck of giraffes?', ""Like I said, there are several likely selective pressures.  But all of them ARE natural selection reducing one gene set and pushing another into prominence.   Okapi live in dense rainforest and are very solitary animals.  They have plenty of food and don't have a violent rutting season. Their neck is shorter than their common ancestor with giraffes.  Giraffes live in large herds near the boundary between forests and open grassland and among hundreds of other species of migratory herbivores.  They also have several very proficient at camouflage cat species as their predators.  So a long neck helps with eating vegetation inaccesible to other herbivores, helps with detecting predators, and helps with dominance and virility displays to secure mates among the herd.  Natural Selection doesn't have to be just one thing.  And it also doesn't have to be predictable.    The random nature of mutation means that first a species must contain the genes and epigenetics to even produce a biological system that allows for an exploitation of their environment.  Then the selective pressures must also exist to stop the majority population without the mutations from successful breeding.    It doesn't matter how tall a tree grows if nothing has the genes to climb it or reach up into the branches then nothing will eat its leaves.  And if nothing is eating leaves, why spend the time growing so big?  One thing changes significantly (rivers dig paths, mountains grow, atmospheric gas concentrations shift, the sun has a phase of high or low output), then all the other life has to adapt, and then adapt to the other life adapting, and it just goes on forever.    The interconnectedness and the multiple ways to solve a problem makes invivo predictions nearly impossible.  We can look back, but looking forward you can only suggest how what exists now might most simply adapt to an assumed environmental change.  But that change may never happen.  And if it did, the genes for the exploitation change may never exist and the species simply goes extinct.""]"

First, while the bourgeoisie does have a class interest in fighting against communism, that doesn't stop the fact that the bourgeoisie is also comprised of individuals and factions that are in competition with one another. Russia is a major competitor in oil, gas, and a number of other areas. Naturally, the US is going to want to hurt its competition.  But also, the US's conflict with Russia needs to be viewed at least partly in the context of the US's fear of a rising China, as well as in light of the US's efforts to strangle Cuba, the DPRK, and Venezuela, among other countries. Russia is a major trade partner and energy supplier of China and of various smaller US targets. Biden very clearly views China, more so than Russia, as a major threat to US hegemony and the existing neoliberal world order. So rather than go after China more directly (as Trump did), his administration seems to want to strangle and destroy China's most important allies.  This whole thing is a little bit bigger than just China though. The US has a lot of enemies it would like to strangle, but which are essentially reinforcing one another. The US tries to go after Syria and Iran, and Russia provides them with military support. The US tries to strangle Venezuela, and Iran sends them aid. What we're seeing is the birth of an anti-imperialist bloc, with China and Russia as the power players, and the US wants to collapse that whole network.  So this is about securing US national capitalist interests. It's about weakening Russian capitalism, about weakening China, and about weakening global resistance to US imperialism."", 'While I understand where you are coming from I disagree on almost every point you make.

The chances of that happening now are pretty close to zero.  Let us not try to debate that here.  Now, will Russia ""win""?  That\'s a huge question that every pundit I listen to has a different opinion of what ""winning"" or ""losing"" is.  I find myself inclined to think of them as temporary setbacks or temporary gains.  I mean when the USSR broke up, that was a huge ""loss"", yet here we are not even 30 years later with Russia seriously gaining World leadership and American hegemony being destroyed.    People dismiss the SCO and the EAEU and the CSTO and the INSTC and the BRICS, but not me.  The US continues to push neo-colonialism.  China (especially) and Russia work to establish win/win scenarios.  The ""Global South"" sees the difference and is more often siding with China against the US.  Russia and China have just established even closer relationships.  All of Asia is turning against US hegemony.  The EU is waking up to the fact that it is a disposable puppet controlled by the US Oligarchy.  I agree that the US Oligarchy    and    (except for the fact that you conflate the US with the US Oligarchy)  I totally reject    rather the S300 has shown itself to be a much better weapons system than the patriot (Check out Brian Berletic), the M777 is a worthless artillery weapon since it is too complicated; the F35 is a piece of junk.  Russia has rewritten the rules of war.  The US depends on close-air support.  The Russians use drones, missiles and artillery.  The US planes can\'t defend themselves against the S300 let alone the S400 or S500.  SWIFT is becoming something that no one cares about any longer.  It isn\'t going to happen overnight, but Russia and China are successfully setting up alternative methods for settling transactions that do not depend on SWIFT.  And only idiots would store their nations wealth in dollars now that the US has shown it cannot be depended upon to honor those commitments.  &amp;#x200B;  But the real question is the Neocons isn\'t it.  I really have no crystal ball here.  There\'s either the 1984 scenario or the French Revolution that will play out.  At this moment I lean toward 1984, hoping I\'m wrong.

The problem is that twisting scripture in small ways can lead to disastrous outcomes. This exact thing has happened with many scriptures. Where this conversation was going was ""well we\'re all sinners so does [this] sin even matter?"" Views that make light of sin always lead to sin .It\'s been the same discussion for almost 2 thousand years now. ""Well wouldn\'t more sin mean more grace?"" Paul responds to this in Romans 6.  What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 2 By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 3 Or don‚Äôt you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.  Notice the exclamation mark after by no means. It\'s not very common in scripture. The words are very strong in the greek.   Anyone who would wish to be a Christian must understand the danger of sin and choose a life of fighting to be free of it by the spirit. Scripture tells us that those who take sin lightly either don\'t understand the high price that was paid for redemption or don\'t appreciate it anyway (hebrews 10:29) and will lose the grace given to them. Christ paid a high price with his own blood and suffering. The word excruciating was created to describe the unimaginable pain of literally tearing your body apart as you fight to take a breath (the cross actually kills by asphyxiation). He gave everything to put an end to sin. He expects people to respect the gravity of the situation   But yes all sin can be redeemed but twisting scripture to make certain sins look less dangerous only leads to dangerous places.

Marx\'s ""alienation"" of the separation of the use value and the exchange value is because the value we see in the use-value is no longer equal to the exchange value. I\'m not saying coats are more valuable by virtue of being coats; I\'m saying that the use-value can\'t be measured (society\'s want for coats can\'t be measured over society\'s want for linen) and unworked capital can\'t be measured either.   To quote a Marxist thinker, ""This gentleman thinks that when he changed the names of things he has changed the things themselves.""  Declaring that some exchange of labour, a money-form (labour vouchers are a money-form with labour as the standard), and goods and services is not exchange does not change the fact that things are exchanged. Proudhon, Tucker, literally anyone is not interested in Marx\'s narrow definition of exchange when it unintuitively excludes most exchanges found in human history. Did barterers not exchange? Did running-tab credit societies not exchange? Nonsense.   ""The capitalists have formed a monopoly which stops people from accessing the goods and services they need. Our solution is to seize everything into one giant monopoly, where everyone will receive the goods and services they need as we see fit.""   Economics is a moral subject - *what, how, and for whom we produce* are ethical questions. Regardless, I\'m making the point that Marx advocates for labour vouchers to recalibrate the economy to meet the value of labour, which implies that labour *is not* the source of value within the society that he is critiquing.  1. Labour is the source of all value. 2. The money-form is obscuring the relational value between commodities. 3. Workers *ought to* introduce labour certificates, which overcome the obscuring nature of money.  Where does that conclusion come from? 1 disappears as an *is* statement and becomes an *ought* statement about how to shake the economy.   This is exchange.  * it has to be, because socialism develops out of capitalism.  This is soothsaying.   Strange way of advocating for a system where workers are reimbursed for their labour (minus costs) through certificates which will allow them to draw from the common pot, but this also stands at odds with what you said beforehand. Did Marx include it as a fun joke or is a part of the plan?', 'Firstly, you have a very poor understanding of labour vouchers if you think money is just a type of labour voucher. Since Marx wrote so little about them, I can understand why.  The differentiating point of a labour voucher is that it can be consumed; on exchange, it is destroyed and the labour it represents is finally exchanged. Because the standard of the labour voucher is labour, it also overcomes some of the ""alienating"" aspects that Marx associated with money. Money cannot be consumed - only exchanged. In this way, Marx is actually incorrect to call money capital, since it has no use-value as a money-form - we can only move it around, so it can\'t be consumed. It can\'t be consumed, so it can\'t have a use-value. It can\'t have a use-value, so it\'s not a commodity.   Because Marx says labour will be rewarded in the form of a certificate which is created and consumed *ad hoc* instead of ""certificates"" which are created, controlled, and rarely destroyed, this is a different type of money-form. And just because labour vouchers are a money form, it does not follow that our current money-form is a labour voucher.  The ought statement is in saying that the mode of exchange will change. I\'m not sharing Marx moralises generally, but that for a system which rewards labour fairly to exist, it must use a different type of money-form. He becomes normative, not descriptive.  If there\'s no is-ought distinction, why does he go from saying labour is the source of value to saying that labour ought to be the standard against which the money-form is leveraged? As you say, ""he can\'t see it any other way"" - why not? The metaphysics of money?', '* Labour vouchers are a money-form, but labour or labour time is the standard they are backed against.  * The Poverty of Philosophy preceded Capital by 20 years and is generally sorted into the ""Young Marx"" category. It was also basically a work of slander, since Proudhon said nothing of labour vouchers and didn\'t write half of the ""quotes"" in Marx\'s ""rebuttal"". Similarly, his criticism of Proudhon as ""abolish[ing] the antagonism between commodities and money within a general context of commodity production"" is also false as Proudhon was very clear in that he wanted to evolve the economy, initially by dismantling the structures which distort the value of money in relation to other goods.  * Great, Marx defined it as a socialist epoch - Proudhon does the same by advocating capital go into the hands of the workers, not taken from them due to an arbitrary division between capital (seize it!) and product (keep it).  * ""Commodity production needs exchange and thus money"" - em, no? Marx says that the initial alienating feature of commodity production is that the worker creates and instantly hands over the commodity to their employer in chapters 1 and 2. Even then, if Marx *did* say that, it\'s utterly unhistorical because we know about non-specific accounting systems, bartering economies, and moneyless economies based on exchange.  * But, if labour *is* the value of the commodity, why is money not acceptable in and of itself? And if labour is the only source of value, how can there be any profit at all, unearned or otherwise? Marx not only advocates for a new system which places labour as the value-form, but he also advocates for the workers engaging in usury against the consumers.  * Tucker never talks about specific labour-time being rewarded - Warren did, but Tucker realised this was a mistake. Although his equivalent argument is a bit all over the place throughout his writing, he said that labour-time and necessary idleness should be compensated; without state forces, this would be equivalent to Marx\'s system *but* it would also stop the worker from charging a profit from the customer *as much as is possible*, instead of handing the profit over to the worker and declaring exploitation done with.  While labour as opposed to labour-power is a valuable idea, it\'s utterly irrelevant to Tucker\'s ideas since he rejects Marx\'s metaphysics of the ""productivity of capital"" - if labour itself, in the direct sense, was compensated without state intervention, it would give us an equivalent labour-to-labour system.']"

However these biopsy samples were taken from numerous people, black white rich and poor. None of these people were ever compensated for the biopsy samples. This was tissue that would‚Äôve been thrown away otherwise but was used to advance medicine and help other people. Based on this, Henrietta Lacks was treated no differently and the tissue taken from her body was taken to help her and would‚Äôve been thrown away but for the efforts of the researchers who did all the work.  In the scenario, Henrietta‚Äôs body wasn‚Äôt taken, rather a cancer was removed in an effort to save her life. Tissue that had no value was made valuable through the work of other people. I don‚Äôt see how she really added any value. I certainly don‚Äôt think there is any merit to any claim of discrimination since samples from white people and rich people were treated the same way.  Personally I think her family is playing the race card to try and get money from companies and organizations. If you can show me any evidence of discrimination, please go ahead. However I can‚Äôt find anything to say that a person of a different race would‚Äôve been treated differently.', 'I think it‚Äôs worth considering who exactly is profiting. The tissue was taken and Henrietta lacks was not compensated. The tissue at that time had very little utility. It was made useful by a series of academic researchers who made a cell line called HeLa that they freely distributed. They didn‚Äôt make any money off this. You can still get the cell line for free. People than used this freely available cell line that did not come with any licensing obligations to perform research to develop entirely different products that were profitable.  So ethically it seems that researchers turned medical waste into something useful that has been used for a variety of experiments both academic and commercial. I don‚Äôt see why the family member of the person from whom the cancer tissue was taken should be compensated. Compensation is usually for some work somebody did or to compensate somebody for harm. I don‚Äôt see Henrietta lacks or her family doing any work. I don‚Äôt see any harm. I don‚Äôt see any reason they should be compensated.', 'I agree that if somebody was wronged, their surviving family members should be able to seek compensation. My point is that I cannot seem to find any significant injustice that Henrietta Lacks suffered.  To clarify what happened, she had a malignant cancer removed from her cervix. That surgery was going to be performed regardless since it was cancer. That tissue that was going to be thrown out was used in an experiment and some of those cells were able to be grown. Those cells were used in many subsequent experiments .  There are two issues I can think of here. First is that no consent was obtained. However consent in the 1950s was essentially not common practice. I think it might make sense to try and compensate every patient who‚Äôs tissue was used without consent back then, however I don‚Äôt think it makes sense to compensate just one person and ignore the rest of the people who are also Affected by this practice.  The second issue is that her sample went on to create a valuable soul and that other people have profited from. Some people think that she or her family should be able to profit from those products. The issue I have with this is that generally speaking, patients are not compensated for their biopsy tissue and certainly not given a percentage of the profits of anything developed from it. Is this fair? It is the system that medical organizations all over the world have all decided is the norm so it seems to be standard ethical practice. I also think that makes sense since discoveries made in your treatment should go on to benefit other patients and you shouldn‚Äôt be able to withhold knowledge in exchange for payment.']

Do you have an example of a phenomenon that is explained by there being exactly one fixed set of values?  there are a number of other things in physics (quarks for example) which are unobserved and currently unfalsifiable, but which make observed phenomena much easier to explain and thus are accepted.  How is it falsifiable that the constants could have only one value?   also, why/how are you attached to the idea that there's exactly one universe?"", 'Natural selection (as explained in the paper) is selecting for stellar black holes, which contain a universe. The existence of atoms is a means to an end, and the existence of life is just a byproduct. It\'s selecting for the amount of black holes which is akin to reproduction. Cosmological natural selection is testable, just not with our current technology. As of current experiments, it remains within the margin of error, not provable or falsifiable. I would change my mind if someone came up with another explanation for how/why the constants have the values they do that is falsifiable, which as of yet I have not seen. The standard model/relativity, or even String theory/loop quantum gravity all fail to do this. They have the constants as free parameters which must be added in via measurement.  I think it may be likely that this is a simulation, but again that\'s untestable. As of now, cosmological natural selection is the only theory that explains the fine tuning of the constants that produces testable predictions. Personally, I think that we may be in a simulation created by some civilization which itself lives inside a black hole, but no conceivable experiment could test this. Simulation theory is really akin to a religion (one could call the creators of simulation ""God,"" although it could just as easily be some dude in his basement or a flying spaghetti monster).  The simulation hypothesis doesn\'t really fix the fine tuning problem, because you still end up with the issue of how the simulated entities ended up in a universe that allows for their structure. Same with invoking ""God"", which leads to the question of where ""God"" came from.']"

Her critics vociferously deny this utterly false claim that Zharkova is making."", 'That was painful to read through.  Arrogant scientists engaging in mean apologetics is a bit disgusting to witness.  Zharkova\'s paper ties empirical observations to SIM cycles. She doesn\'t necessarily explain why this correlation exists.  As many people noted, irrespective of orbital mechanics, the reality of SIM means substantial changes in the tidal effects of plasma within the Sun. It could just as easily be this which causes SIM cycles to correlate to climatic changes on Earth.  However, it took one Brian Takita to finally make the point that our model of the solar system based on Kepler\'s observations would necessarily be accurate over a long time frame of 100s of years, but there still remains a possibility that over 1000s of years the current model would start to become inaccurate because of this concept of the planets all orbiting a system barycenter.  The point of disagreement, at least in terms of observations, is noting that it takes 100s to 1000s of years for SIM cycles to progress. It\'s not a phenomenon that would show up in a short term model of the solar system\'s orbital mechanics.  In other words, within a few centuries time frame, you can model the solar system by assuming planets exclusively orbit their own unique barycenter with the Sun. And of course, the admission that the Sun itself orbits a SSB. However, the catch is that over 1000s of years the entire system is orbiting the SSB.  That is, Earth IS in fact orbiting the SSB, not the Sun-Earth barycenter, however, the difference between the two is only measurable over thousands of years. That\'s not stated completely accurately. Something more like the Sun-Earth barycenter processes around the SSB over 1000s of years. Something like that.  It does seem like it remains an unanswered question. That scienceTM has realized that this question relates to the sacred grail of climate science, and so it\'s untouchable and won\'t be investigated. Like so much of climate alarmism poisoned science, the question doesn\'t need to be investigated so it can be ignored for now. Orbital models would only be affected by SIM in the long run, so they wouldn\'t need to incorporate the concept for centuries.  Nevertheless, Zharkova\'s paper still identifies some correlation between SIM cycles and climate.  Plenty of statistical nitpicking which even that peer group was unhappy about. Criticisms of Zharkova\'s English ability. Being nasty and rude but then claiming it\'s just being direct, but then critiquing her for being agitated.  What a mess.  Thanks though. As always, every time I dig into a controversial point related to climate I learn almost every time that the alarmist position is wrong, and gain insight into how institutional science is capable of consistently supporting bad science. Science can be hard, which is just a way of saying that lies, arrogance, dissimulation and so forth can make inquiry and debate resolution quite difficult.  It has been argued that Science has to be extremely adversarial in order to properly function, institutionally. Big, nasty, drawn out fights between committed intelligent people. Because sometimes issues are just quite complex and the ""point"" is missed. Look at biological and social sciences, where ethics panels pre-screen papers to avoid any controversy or hurt feelings. What a modern world.  u/randomhomonid what do you think?', 'I\'ve looked into it further and part of your ""orbits are known"" includes the fact that SIM affects the eccentricity of Earth\'s orbit, which has been known for a long time. The claim is that this change in eccentricity is minor, moreover it doesn\'t change the average distance from the Sun.  Zharkova addressed this in a whole paper. The seasonal/axial position of the Earth relative to perihelion is where the change solar irradiance comes from.  So, Zharkova is neither inventing new concepts about orbits, nor is she claiming something that is outside of what ""has been known forever"".  You MAY still argue that even with all this in mind, the effect is too minor to be worth consideration, but that\'s different than what is claimed.  This very strongly resembles institutional wagon-circling, and disingenuous, fallacious gatekeeping.  Zharkova is partly at fault for her poor English ability, but her critics were coming with an agenda.  Her ""basic logic check"" was valid. The SSB is not merely the average of all planet-Sun barycenters. If it was, the Sun\'s center of mass would orbit the SSB in a perfect circle. The Sun is carried on an inertial ride around the SSB, it\'s ""tossed about"", leading to non-circular orbit patterns. That necessarily implies that the planets are not totally and rigidly locked to their barycenter with the Sun.  Again, we do see variations in the Earth\'s eccentricity orbiting the Sun.  This whole thing was greatly complicated by evil and disingenuous, nasty or cowardly gatekeeping scientists.']"

Look at Marx, Bakunin, or any of the social Darwinists to understand their world - the world is on a scale from simple to the complex, the lower to the higher. Progress is not ""stuff changes"", but this develop. Platonic forms applied to society.  I\'m not going to stay on the Ricardo problem for too long, but my point is that Ricardo didn\'t advocate for change - just observation; Marx advocated for change, so did not just observe. His anti-market stance also meant suppressing Ricardo\'s formulation for equilibrium price.  Well, if you want to see it that way, that\'s fine. But Marx is advocating for how society ought to be; how else can we view it? The Utopians also started with the base assumption that society ought to be another way; are we scientific if we build upwards to them through convoluted metaphysics?  Einstein and Hitler is a bizarre turn. Historical materialism is not like - for example - evolution because it has a start and an end as metaphysical points, driving towards a Platonic form. You don\'t get that in science.  My problem is with ""model"" communism and how a black market would naturally emerge or basic supply and demand breakdowns through the reappearance of scarcity.  If Ricardo did, ""rent should be abolished"" is a normative claim. Observations like ""rent abolition leads to blah blah"" is a descriptive statement which can be backed by empirical or logical evidence, i.e. within the present day. When Marx steps into the future, the soothsayer creates a new ethics and, invariably, talks normatively. I\'m also intrigued why you think normative ethics are out and out bad - there\'s nothing wrong with a normative ethical statement... unless you\'re pretending you\'re being a scientist.  Advocating for centralisation - which is the opposite of what most socialist movements ""naturally"" do, by the way - is a normative statement. The Communist Manifesto is filled with normative economical ethics and then, amusingly, contradicted when he sees the Paris Commune and realises Proudhon was onto something. There\'s a fun Bakunin quote about Marx and Engels shitting their pants when they saw what an *actual* dictatorship of the proletariat looked like, but the Civil War in France overlooks key details, reducing it to a mere piece of propaganda.  Any compensation would be *unequal*, but arbitrary? No more arbitrary than if a small apple sells for less than a big apple. Then again, this criticism only makes sense if you think Proudhon and Tucker advocated for labour-time compensation, which they didn\'t. You\'d have to fall for some old piece of propaganda written by an ideologue to believe that.', '&amp;#x200B;   Oh my god you\'re so close.  Okay, so it would be possible for Ricardo to make a descriptive statement and then also a normative one, right? Once he makes the normative statement, his books do not, in fact, burst into flames, right? So as a person, subjected to the human condition, his descriptive findings of reality will without a doubt influence how he perceives the world and affect how he feels about it, right? But none of this invalidates the theoretical work he\'s doing, right?   The only part you feel necessary to shove in here, that obviously has nothing to do with humes is-ought distinction, or what generally distinguishies normative from descriptive statements - is the ""evidence in the present day"" thing. That part you\'re just using to go off on another rant about how marx also made political demands and that means his theory must be predicated on normative statements. Once more, Einstein did not have evidence for black holes in his day, but the absence of evidence for something does not indicate whether a statement is normative or not. I\'m merely comparing here how Einstein and Marx are identical in that they\'re making theoretical claims, just like Hitler and Einstein both had funny hair, this isn\'t a comparison of anything else about these people. This serves only as a logical analogy to illuminate that the absence of evidence does not indicate normative quality.  I don\'t know if you have a massive hard on for ricardo or you just hate marx for some reason, but the extent of your criticism is that whenever Marx deviates from your preferred economists, it must be because of all those nasty political positions he also holds. Which, maybe, I guess? How do you know it\'s Marx presumed anti market stance that makes him drop concepts present in Ricardo\'s theory? Do you have evidence for that claim in the present day?    If you have a variable that you cannot enumerate you cannot rationally assign a number variable to it and claim it stands in any relation to it. This has nothing to do with Marx or anyone else, just logic. How many apples is motherhood worth? How many cars for a loving relationship?', ' ""If you let milk stand for 7 weeks, it will start to turn red.""  This is an assumption about the progression of something, it is also a wrong assumption and I also can\'t imagine a world where milk doesn\'t turn red. Milk actually turns a more greenish color, directly opposed to red.  None of this turns the statement into one about values that I hold, it only makes it factually incorrect.   Yes, the very same sentiment that I expressed applies in this phrasing as well. That a liberal would be particularly well endowed to assess bourgeois society descriptively, is a ridiculous statement. It\'s nice that you feel Ricardo was descriptive, but I don\'t see at all how you\'re differentiating your attack on Marx from your defense of Ricardo. Even if you want to say that Marx was wrong in his assessments and Ricardo still holds true, this doesn\'t make one descriptive and the other normative.   Again, amending a theory with other factors doesn\'t make it less descriptive. Ricardo isn\'t some well of truth where any departure of his theory automatically becomes a moral appeal. It;s just another instance of you phrasing Marx in a way that suits your perception of his theory being normative.   I\'m not sure what this part is in response to.   ""Hitler was stupid because he had funny hair""  ""Einstein had funny hair and he wasn\'t stupid, so you\'re making a bad argument""  ""omg, you\'re comparing Einstein with Hitler""  Einstein could not substantiate the existence of black holes, that did not stop him from theorizing them. Whether or not we later find out that black holes exist or not, whether Marx turns out correct or not, does not retroactively turn a theory into a normative one. Einstein was correct and Marx may well have been wrong, this changes nothing about what I just said.   And now we\'re approaching the typical quality of argumentation on here. Instead of conceding any points, or trying to react to the quote in a way that would reconcile it with your criticism, it\'s apparently me who has to explain to you what Marx theory is.   As did Marx, these statements pertain to ""model"" capitalism, no shortages, etc. In reality the money-compensation is affected by a great many things, yet fundamentally still one of equal exchange where labor power is one commodity and the wage received, another.   *The point is that there is no problem in Marx works pertaining to theory.*  If Ricardo, in his everlasting descriptiveness, identifies rent as economically inefficient, would it be particularly far fetched for himself, or any reader of his theory, to advocate certain things that pertain to the regulation of rent? How would you react to this? Would you say ""well, if Ricardo motivated you to appeal to political authorities, making normative statement such as \'rent is naturally a monopoly price and I think society would be better served if we regulated it in certain ways!\', then his theory must be a normative one!""  Does a climate scientist advocating for a reduction of CO2 emissions turn their findings into normative statements?  Does Marx advocating for political changes on the basis of his economic analysis turn his findings into normative statements? What\'s the problem, Marx? If your theory is so descriptive, what got you all riled up? U mad bro?   No, it wouldn\'t, because labor is not quantifiable, therefore any enumerated reward would be arbitrary. It\'s also not just ""the labor time"" as in, how long an individual person labors and everyone who works 8 hours get\'s 8 labor tickets, but depends on the NLT necessary to reproduce that labor power.']"

Lockpicking requires Security (or Lockpicking) and lockpicks, while the magical version requires Alteration, multiple spells, and enough magicka to cast (also preferably the silent casting perk from Illusion).', ""The granularity is only meaningless if you consider Lockpicking in a vacuum. Within the context of the game's systems Lockpicking is an investment that needs to be made against other skills. The granularity allows you to invest in multiple skills at the same time and offers control over the extent of that investment. It's a legitimate strategy for example, to raise Lockpicking from 45 to 51 and keep Mentats handy to get you to 55 when you need to pick a lock‚Äîallowing the other points to be invested elsewhere until the next level.    Fallout 4 removes the skill system entirely and then incorporates rote stat increases into the Perk tree. To accommodate the lack of granularity in stat investments Fallout 4 removes the level cap and significantly increasing the frequency at which the player levels up. This is a meaningful reduction in complexity. Lockpicking is now represented by three discrete Perk values (Advanced/Master/Expert) unlocked at specific level increments not a freely chosen investment. The final upgrade to Lockpicking makes your bobby pins invincible so managing bobby pins is eliminated as a balancing mechanic. Magazines and books are removed from the game. Mentats are in the game but have no meaningful utility without a skill system.   There were moments of emergent gameplay in New Vegas and Fallout 3 where I had neglected to invest in Lockpicking but triumphantly bypassed a crucial area because I had Locksmith Reader and a pack of Mentats in my inventory that just barely got me to 75 lockpicking. That's just gone with Fallout 4's system."", ""I mean both forms use different tactics to solve the same problem.  Physical lockpicking (whether in Fallout or TES use the same system) can use stat buffs, in the form of Chems, Magazines, Scrolls, and Blessings, as well as Higher Quality Lockpicks in order to allow them access to the Lockpicking minigame.  Magical lockpicking (in TES only) uses similar stat buffs to achieve the same goal, but in a different way. Whereas physical increases stats to access the minigame, magical increases a different set of stats to actually cast the spell, either to give yourself the magicka or to appease the spell chance algorithm. The exception of course lockbreaking scrolls which can break the lock for you but at a cost.  But still, the biggest tradeoff between the two is strategic in nature rather than tactical.   Physical lockpicking requires the skill and the tool. The tool is trivial. I don't know about you but I've never bought a lockpick or bobby pin in any game except Morrowind, since lockpick quality was a thing there. The skill requires you to either place stat points (NV) or perk points (Skyrim/FO4) which you could otherwise put into combat or other skills.  Magical lockpicking requires the skill and the spell. You probably put points into the skill already because Alteration contains an important spell for mages. The spell however has to be bought or found. You also will need multiple versions to handle higher and higher level locks and those higher level spells cost more magicka, meaning more investment into that as well, though you also probably do that anyway being a mage.""]"

Well spotted, because I didn\'t do this entirely on accident.  Nothing about personal virtue, personal effort or goals needs to be gendered. There\'s nothing about any virtue considered ""masculine"" that non-men can\'t do. In this sense, there is no version of ""masculinity"" that is not in some way reductive.  Heck, in this sense, masculinity and femininity are artificial, fake concepts. Which... yeah, they are.  But a common criticism from toxic men is that ""masculinity is seen as bad"". If we assign gender to certain values and virtues and actions - and we tend to do that, for good and for ill - it\'s important, to me, to find the best possible way to be that way.  Gentleness and being considerate is associated with femininity. So I want that femininity to be realised through gentleness that is not meek or afraid. Does this trait HAVE to be framed as feminine? Or treated as a virtue only when women exhibit it? Of course not. But it\'s something that society reads as feminine, and also something that, realised this way, doesn\'t trap or constrain or damage anything. From there, we can state the obvious - it\'s just one way to be feminine, and women are under no obligation TO be feminine, and it\'s fine if men are feminine. But we take a cultural shortcut (needlessly gendered as it may be) and do something good with it.  In the same way, being strong and firm (physically or mentally or even emotionally) is often labelled ""masculine"". The best way to be strong in a masculine way is to use that strength to protect anyone that needs protection. Rather than, for instance, prove to everyone you\'re the top dog, the alpha male, that you can break anyone\'s nose who gets in your way.  And again - men don\'t have to be masculine this way (or any way). Women are free to be masculine, or to be the same way and reject the idea that they\'re masculine. It\'s fine.  But since a lot of men are strongly emotionally connected to, and invested in, the idea of masculinity, I think it\'s good to find a way for them to be that that is not a heap of stinky garbage.  Again - I know the inherent problem with that kind of thinking is that it still uses the gender binary. But within that framework, making masculinity make sense and be good, for anyone who strives to be more masculine, is a good thing. That is not to say that men need to be (for instance) strong in any particular way. But it\'s good to be able to point to ""see, that\'s a good way to be strong"" to anyone whose identity incorporates the ideal of masculinity, to have a signpost for ""so that\'s one way to be strong that everyone will appreciate"".  I hope that makes some measure of sense. I\'ll admit to speaking from a heavy personal bias. The ideas of masculinity and femininity are useful for me to navigate the world, for partially personal reasons. I am not fully comfortable yeeting them altogether. I am not quite sure I\'m equipped to articulate that in a Reddit comment of any reasonable length.', ' There is no toxic masculinity.', 'üëÜ Toxic masculinity']"

Longevity is a goal mark in many proposals we receive. A proposal is the criteria thresholds manufacturers would like to achieve.   Very often, products would like to meet a use scenario of X quantity. This is usually in excess of what consumers would use the item.     For example, many washing machine manufacturers would like to hit a usability of around 1500 loads of laundry at a minimum. With many EU and US regional models having PRLs around twice that. That would be around 3x that average number of uses for that product yearly.   When manufacturers fall short of these proposals, they redesign the product usually. Like Samsung did when LG started making better models.   Some things are designed to be cheap/disposable. Yes. To be frank, it is obviously so too.   Such as many Sony loud speakers are very cheaply made and sold at a way lower price point than other products from, say Mackie, Fluence or Klipsch.   However, it is accurate to say many people not familiar with product testing and research have a somewhat fantastical view of planned obsolescence.    A Ninja blender being sold for $100 that does10 things is not the same product as a $800 Vitamix. A cosumer may just think they are two blenders, but that's not the way to look at it."", 'The average is around 300 loads a year in the US (I live and work in the US, but this varies by region). They shoot for a 5 year duration, 1500, and often double or triple that in the PRL. After a certain point, the engineers predict the product is unlikely to fail if it hasn\'t failed in 1500 cycles, hours uses, etc.   Certain models are made at different price points, sizes, and regulation standards by region. Often, they can\'t use X or Y components from one model to the next.  This partly is why they have different criteria per product or model for testing.  Most products will fail early in their use cycle, if at all. Generally,  manufacturers would like to not have to replace products or have their brand perceived to be low quality.   Most things will fail in time. Even ""old"" stuff made back in the day, so to speak, will eventually fail. Many of them did in their day as well- it\'s just a bias your grandma\'s old stove didn\'t break down, or your grandpa\'s old Monte Carlo ran perfectly for decades. That\'s the reality of physics, friction, material wear &amp; tear, etc.   Sometimes manufacturers don\'t care about longevity, absolutely yes.   Some products are made cheaply or quickly and not meant to last decades. Though many products are not desired to be cheap or low quality as they hurt the product brand or consumer confidence in the manufacturer.   Testing is done by customers/consumers in real scenarios when possible. The manufacturers like to test in phases; lab test, home use test, observed use, focus testing, etc.   Vitamix, Kitchenaid, Staub, AllClad, Breville Le Creuset, Matfer, Global, OXO, for example, all make kitchen related products that the engineers try to make as durable and long last as possible. Their PRLs are pretty hefty.   But even so, Le Creuset or Oxo also makes cheaper stuff at lower price points. This is made less durable, cheaper.   It\'s not accurate to say, ""Le Cresuset builds stuff to last generations,"" as is often claimed.    Planned obsolescence does happen. Though not to the degree often misunderstood or exaggerated by general consumers for a number of reasons not related to the actual products at times.', 'Well, the OP had cookware that cost thousands of bucks. As an example of ""long lasting"" products. Yeah, and they still make that cookware today, and yes, it will last generations. It will cost significantly.   That\'s just the reality of physics. It takes a lot to engineer products that last for a long time, usually. Not all these things are equal either.  A cast iron skillet is a relatively simple product. Technology might change the offerings of refrigerators, washing machines, or cellphones much more than a pan or light bulb.   I have old flip phones in the garage that still ""work."" But one might upgrade their phone for new features, form factor, newer hardware, etc.   When I was young we had an old fridge handed down from my grandmother that ran ""fine"". We upgraded to a new fridge with features such as an ice maker, a water dispenser, and so on. The old fridge went into the basement as a spare.   Many products cut corners in the service of greed, naturally. Though, quality products are still made today as in the past.  There were likely a lot of fridges of the same model type as my grandmother\'s old fridge that didn\'t last as long. Pointing to the one that didn\'t fail and assuming they all ran for decades without error is a bias.   There are factors like more things being made out of plastic, product complexity, user familiarity, and many items being more difficult to repair or service by laymen that feeds that bias as well.   My grandfather was a musician and made acoustic guitars. He also repaired them - people had high quality, expensive guitars, and cheap ones that needed more or less repairs back in the 60s and 70s as today.   My dad was a car mechanic. Cars broke down in the 70s and 80s.   My uncle owned a furniture repair business. Furtiniute broke down in the 60s and 70s, too.  The surviving products are not always indictive of greater attention to longevity than today. There is more to it than that. This is why I said earlier that consumers have an overexaggerated sense of ""planned obsolescence.""   Planned obsolescence is real. But that doesn\'t mean all products are such and a lot of them are made to last. But you might not find a saucepan sold at $10 will last the same as a $1000 Mauviel saucepan either.']"

Not even parliament approved of the McMahon line, and it was clearly illegal by international convention.  India insisted upon this border by force of arms (sending Bob Khathing to secure the annexation). Tibet was de jure acknowledged as part of Chinese territory by almost every nation in the world including all 4 non-China allied powers. In 1959 India sent small arms after the 14th Dalai Lama\'s brothers instigated a small and failed revolt in Lhasa before whisking him and tens of thousands of mostly Tibetan aristocrats away to India.  India then annexed Goa (which unlike Hong Kong, was legally ceded in perpetuity to its colonial occupier) in 1961 and kept pushing aggressive rhetoric all the while very clearly trying to encircle Chinese positions north of the McMahon line.

Broad coalition, frictions smoothed over, avoided appearance of imperial ambition, clear warfighting goals and exit plan, first true demonstration of modern combat (making potential adversaries kinda shit themselves and clear the way for US goals), and left the US in a far greater position to project power in the Gulf via bases in Kuwait and, shortly thereafter, the reactivation of the Fifth Fleet to be based out of Bahrain.   Bush lost on domestic issues and a surprisingly strong insurgent from his right flank. But damn if the Gulf War didn‚Äôt instill a sense of pride in America‚Äôs armed forces that had been missing since Vietnam, and confirm the potential of an all-volunteer professional military.', 'Eh, a given excuse but I don‚Äôt really buy it. The US has only retained a token force in Saudi since the end of the gulf war, predominantly at a single airbase jointly managed with the Royal Saudi Air Force - and basing agreements until 9/11 precluded its use for offensive action.   Even if you accept it at face value, it really doesn‚Äôt change the calculus for Bush Sr. Iraq had invaded Kuwait and was going to invade KSA. If you remove the Desert Storm part of the equation, preventing Saddam from controlling a plurality of global oil supply would necessitate a much larger permanent US presence in Saudi. A never ending Desert Shield was not an acceptable outcome.  There will always be batshit people like Bin Laden. I do not blame HW for that. He was exceedingly careful to put an Arab face on the conflict. Egypt was a major partner, it was ensured that Kuwaiti forces were the ones to retake their capital, Israel was cajoled into not responding to SCUD attacks (to prevent Arab members from pulling out, lest they be on the same side a Israel in a war) and the coalition included not just Kuwait, KSA, and Egypt as Arab and/or Muslim partners - but Bahrain, Bangladesh, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Senegal, *Syria*, Turkey, the UAE - and even, in fact, the Afghan Mujaheddin', ' I apologize that my reply is late   Been relatively busy as of lately    It\'s actually around 5,000 from the initial events of the gulf war, over 100,000 to 200,000 resulted from the conflict and it\'s aftermath.  Those cannot go unseen.   Your argument is similar to saying no one died on that titanic on the initial collision with the iceberg all while not including the aftermath and consequences.   Forces.net did an article detailing such about the gulf war.   They cover wider military news.   War isn\'t over once the combat stops.  It destabilizes the lives of both soldiers and civilians. And often causes far more deaths long after the final fight is over.   Edit: in my initial comment on this post the reason I mentioned Afghanistan was because I was citing it as an extended example of the large civilian casualties, that\'s why it was brought up.  Inflated civilian casualties over many conflicts point to impractical tactics still being used.  Because the comment cited it as the first Iraq war I was thrown off and confused it with the 2003.   Either way, my point still is consistent as the gulf war (desert storm) had substantial civilian casualties.   The 1990-91 conflict was an invasion of Kuwait.  It\'s commonly referred to as the gulf war instead of ""first Iraq war"" which is rather vague to not only u.s conflicts but the overall history of Iraq.    I refer to the 90-91 conflict  as the gulf war, others call it desert storm.  I apologize for the confusion.']"

This isn\'t just because everyone on 4chan had a change of heart. It was mostly because around 2014-2015ish, Tumblr ""SJWs"" (which I\'ve been banned from other subs for just saying, meanwhile that\'s what they called themselves at that time) were becoming increasingly vocal and increasingly annoying and started to get taken seriously by journalists (gaming journalism particularly at the time, but obviously later it would become mainstream journalism and politics in general).   If there was never a group of very very vocal, generally unhinged, aggressive, and annoying SJWs forcing their beliefs down everyone\'s throats and insisting that anyone who doesn\'t 100% line up with them is a nazi, then there wouldn\'t be the same ""alt right"" that exists today. It\'s purley a reaction to the craziness that was born of the ""SJW"" movement. This is probably kind of obvious, since that\'s mostly what fascism is, just an overreaction to some crazy leftists.   Amd of course they egg eachother on and push eachother to become more and more hateful towards eacbother and more and more aggressive and angry.   I can see why people on the ""alt right"" eventually did slip into the role that they were being accused of being. If someone you really don\'t like calls you a nazi all the time, and is constantly going off about how much they hate nazis and how nazis are everywhere, you\'re pretty likely to think ""well I guess I am a nazi then!

Stephen Kotkin, who has written the most recent award winning biographies on Stalin, has stipulated as much, writing:  Altogether, the regime returned about 5.7 million tons of grain back to agriculture, including 2 million tons from reserves and 3.5 million from procurements. Stalin also approved clandestine purchase of grain and livestock abroad using scarce hard currency. Just between Feb and Jul. 1933, he signed or countenanced nearly three dozen small allocations of food aid to the countryside, primarily to the North Caucasus and Ukraine, as well as the Kazakh lands....Similarly, there was no ""Ukrainian"" famine; the famine was Soviet.  Source: Kotkin, ""Stalin: Waiting for Hitler 1929-1941"", p. 128-129.  Not every terrible famine is a genocide. Millions died in the effort for fast collectivisation, to help pay for industrialisation and armament of the USSR, which was poorly carried out, in an atmosphere of heightened security threats from Japan (1931-33 conquest of Manchuria) and threats from the West (namely Romania, Poland). To add to this, compared to the bumper crump year of 1930-31, 1932-33 experienced historic drought (globally), and crop pestilence, which added immensely to the woes of collective farmers.  Stalin &amp; the Bolsheviks did not have a special animus against Ukrainians, indeed it was Stalin who promoted an separate republic for Ukraine:  Stalin: ""...a Belorussian nation exists, which has its own language, different from Russian, and that the culture of the Belorussian nation can be raised only in its own language. Such speeches were made five years ago about Ukraine, concerning the Ukrainian nation... Clearly, the Ukrainian nation exists and the development of its culture is a duty of Communists. One cannot go against history.""  Source: Stephen Kotkin, ""Stalin: Paradoxes of Power, 1878-1929"", p. 388.  Indeed Stalin\'s right-hand man during these years, Kaganovich; the head of the military and a good friend, Voroshilov; as well as his ultimate successor Kruchshev, were all Ukrainians, amongst many, many others in the Bolshevik regime.', ""The second cause of the famine was the drought that hit certain areas of Ukraine in 1930, 1931 and 1932. For Professor James E. Mace,\xa0 who defends the Ukrainian far-right line at Harvard, it is a fable created by the Soviet r–πgime. However, in his A History of Ukraine, Mikhail Hrushevsky,\xa0 described by the Nationalists themselves as `Ukraine's leading historian', writing of the year 1932, claimed that `Again a year of drought coincided with chaotic agricultural conditions'.  Professor Nicholas Riasnovsky,\xa0 who taught at the Russian Research Center at Harvard, wrote that the years 1931 and 1932 saw drought conditions. Professor Michael Florinsky,\xa0 who struggled against the Bolsheviks during the Civil War, noted: `Severe droughts in 1930 and 1931, especially in the Ukraine, aggravated the plight of farming and created near famine conditions'.  The third cause of the famine was a typhoid epidemic that ravaged Ukraine and North Caucausus. Dr. Hans Blumenfeld,\xa0 internationally respected city planner and recipient of the Order of Canada, worked as an architect in Makayevka, Ukraine during the famine. He wrote:  `There is no doubt that the famine claimed many victims. I have no basis on which to estimate their number .... Probably most deaths in 1933 were due to epidemics of typhus, typhoid fever, and dysentery. Waterborne diseases were frequent in Makeyevka; I narrowly survived an attack of typhus fever.'  Horsley Grant, the man who made the absurd estimate of 15 million dead under the famine --- 60 per cent of an ethnic Ukrainian population of 25 million in 1932 --- noted at the same time that `the peak of the typhus epidemic coincided with the famine .... it is not possible to separate which of the two causes was more important in causing casualties.'  The fourth cause of the famine was the inevitable disorder provoked by the reorganization of agriculture and the equally profound upheaval in economic and social relations: lack of experience, improvization and confusion in orders, lack of preparation and leftist radicalism among some of the poorer peasants and some of the civil servants.  The numbers of one to two million dead for the famine are clearly important. These human losses are largely due to the ferocious opposition of the exploiting classes to the reorganization and modernization of agriculture on a socialist basis. But the bourgeoisie would make Stalin and socialism responsible for these deaths. The figure of one to two million should also be compared to the nine million dead caused by the 1921--1922 famine, essentially provoked by the military intervention of eight imperialist powers and by the support that they gave to reactionary armed groups.  The famine did not last beyond the period prior to the 1933 harvest. Extraordinary measures were taken by the Soviet government to guarantee the success of the harvest that year. In the spring, thirty-five million poods of seeds, food and fodder were sent to Ukraine. The organization and management of kolkhozy was improved and several thousand supplementary tractors, combines and trucks were delivered.  Hans Blumenfeld\xa0 presented, in his autobiography, a r–πsum–π of what he experienced during the famine in Ukraine:  `[The famine was caused by] a conjunction of a number of factors. First, the hot dry summer of 1932, which I had experienced in northern Vyatka, had resulted in crop failure in the semiarid regions of the south. Second, the struggle for collectivization had disrupted agriculture. Collectivization was not an orderly process following bureaucratic rules. It consisted of actions by the poor peasants, encouraged by the Party. The poor peasants were eager to expropriate the ``kulaks,'' but less eager to organize a cooperative economy. By 1930 the Party had already sent out cadres to stem and correct excesses .... After having exercised restraint in 1930, the Party put on a drive again in 1932. As a result, in that year the kulak economy ceased to produce, and the new collective economy did not yet produce fully. First claim on the inadequate product went to urban industry and to the armed forces; as the future of the entire nation, including the peasants, depended on them, it could hardly be otherwise ....  `In 1933 rainfall was adequate. The Party sent its best cadres to help organize work in the kolkhozes. They succeeded; after the harvest of 1933 the situation improved radically and with amazing speed. I had the feeling that we had been pulling a heavy cart uphill, uncertain if we would succeed; but in the fall of 1933 we had gone over the top and from then on we could move forward at an accelerating pace.'  Hans Blumenfeld\xa0 underscored that the famine also struck the Russian regions of Lower Volga and North Caucasus.  `This disproves the ``fact'' of anti-Ukrainian genocide parallel to Hitler's anti-semitic holocaust. To anyone familiar with the Soviet Union's desperate manpower shortage in those years, the notion that its leaders would deliberately reduce that scarce resource is absurd ....' -Another View of Stalin\nj0ug8mm\tconspiracy\tj0ubcdk\tzpdvfw\t20221219\t19\tGr8Kahli\teven worse is that the admins are in this by deactivating upvotes,shadowban and deleting post/comments.

The more patients they could catch.‚Äù  **PCR inventor Kary Mullis writes:**   ‚ÄúIn 1988 I was working as a consultant at Specialty Labs in Santa Monica, CA, setting up analytic routines for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). **I knew a lot about setting up analytic routines for anything with nucleic acids in it because I invented the Polymerase Chain Reaction. That\'s why they hired me.**     Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), on the other hand, was something I did not know a lot about. Thus, when **I found myself writing a report on our progress and goals for the project, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, I recognized that I did not know the scientific reference to support a statement I had just written: ""HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.""**     **So I turned to the virologist at the next desk, a reliable and competent fellow, and asked him for the reference. He said I didn\'t need one.** I disagreed. While it\'s true that certain scientific discoveries or techniques are so well established that their sources are no longer referenced in the contemporary literature, that didn\'t seem to be the case with the HIV/AIDS connection. **It was totally remarkable to me that the individual who had discovered the cause of a deadly and as-yet-uncured disease would not be continually referenced in the scientific papers until that disease was cured and forgotten.** But as I would soon learn, the name of that individual - who would surely be Nobel material - was on the tip of no one\'s tongue.‚Äù   ‚ÄúAfter ten or fifteen meetings over a couple years, I was getting pretty upset when no one could cite the reference. I didn\'t like the ugly conclusion that was forming in my mind: The entire campaign against a disease increasingly regarded as a twentieth century Black Plague was based on a hypothesis whose origins no one could recall. That defied both scientific and common sense.     **Finally, I had an opportunity to question one of the giants in HIV and AIDS research, DL Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute,** when he gave a talk in San Diego. It would be the last time I would be able to ask my little question without showing anger, and I figured Montagnier would know the answer. So I asked him.     **With a look of condescending puzzlement, Montagnier said, ""Why don\'t you quote the report from the Centers for Disease Control? ""**     **I replied, ""It doesn\'t really address the issue of whether or not HIV is the probable cause of AIDS, does it?""**     **‚ÄùNo,"" he admitted, no doubt wondering when I would just go away.** He looked for support to the little circle of people around him, but they were all awaiting a more definitive response, like I was.     **‚ÄùWhy don\'t you quote the work on SIV [Simian Immunodeficiency Virus]?"" the good doctor offered.**     **‚ÄùI read that too, DL Montagnier,"" I responded. ""What happened to those monkeys didn\'t remind me of AIDS. Besides, that paper was just published only a couple of months ago. I\'m looking for the original paper where somebody showed that HIV caused AIDS.**     This time, DL **Montagnier\'s response was to walk quickly away to greet an acquaintance across the room.‚Äù**     ‚ÄúWe have not been able to discover any good reasons why most of the people on earth believe that AIDS is a disease caused by a virus called HIV. There is simply no scientific evidence demonstrating that this is true.     We have also not been able to discover why doctors prescribe a toxic drug called AZT (Zidovudine) to people who have no other complaint other than the fact that they have the presence of antibodies to HIV in their blood.

The subpoenas are among a dozen issued by the plaintiffs in that suit this week.  The lawsuit was filed in March by a coalition that includes the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and several individual voters who claim the congressional boundaries approved by the Legislature in 2021 violated the Utah Constitution. The suit names Lt. Gov. Diedre Henderson, the Utah Legislature, Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson, Utah Senate President Stuart Adams and the Legislature‚Äôs Redistricting Committee as defendants.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs refused to provide a copy of the subpoenas, saying they do not publicly release such documents during litigation.  A source familiar with the case, speaking on background, told The Salt Lake the subpoenas are seeking documents and other records relating to the drawing of the new maps during the redistricting process.  Odd: Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) just had to announce to the House (via the reading clerk) that he‚Äôs been served with a subpoena from the 3rd judicial district court of Salt Lake County and has not yet decided if he's going to comply with it...  ‚Äî Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) December 22, 2022   A separate court filing requesting information from the Utah Legislature demonstrates what the plaintiffs seek. They‚Äôve asked for draft maps that weren‚Äôt approved by lawmakers, including data and analyses related to those draft plans. Plaintiffs are also seeking any communications with current or former members of Congress or legislators and members of their staff and contacts with Gov. Spencer Cox and Lt. Gov. Diedre Henderson and their team.  Plaintiffs are also seeking any contacts between lawmakers and Adam Foltz, a Republican political operative who has played a role in Wisconsin‚Äôs 2010 redistricting process that federal judges slammed as ‚Äúneedlessly secret.‚Äù In 2021, Foltz was hired by Republicans in the Texas Legislature to help shepherd their redistricting efforts, The Texas Tribune reported.  Lawmakers have also been asked to provide records of any contact with Adam Kincaid, who heads up the National Republican Redistricting Trust, the GOP‚Äôs main mapmaking organization.  Other Utahns subpoenaed about the case include former congressman Rob Bishop, who served on the independent redistricting commission until he resigned in protest near the end of the process, former state Rep. Paul Ray, who co-chaired the Legislature‚Äôs redistricting committee and Rex Facer, who chaired the independent commission.  The subpoenas were issued after a Utah district judge refused a request by lawyers for the state to throw out the lawsuit.  In a separate court filing from earlier this month, lawyers for the plaintiffs complained lawmakers were hiding behind a claim of ‚Äúlegislative privilege‚Äù to avoid answering their questions.  ‚ÄúNo Utah court has ever recognized a special ‚Äòlegislative privilege‚Äô to refuse to engage in discovery in a civil case, especially when the Legislature and its members have been found to be proper parties,‚Äù the filing reads.

Homosexuality was banned/discouraged in socialist nations because it was the medical consensus up until fairly recently that it was a disorder and liberal attitudes toward homosexuality are quite recent in the capitalist west. The DDR legalized gay sex in the late 1980‚Äôs, when anti sodomy laws were on the books and enforced in parts of the United States until 2003. More contemporary examples of attitudes changing in communist societies are Philippine communist rebels recognizing same sex marriage in the areas that they control in 2005 and Cuba enacting arguably the most progressive marriage/family laws in the world earlier this year.', ' It\'s my understanding that the partitions of Poland until 1918 imposed restrictions, and post WWI various penal codes from other states that criminalized it remained in place until that 1932 decision. (though I reserve the right to be wrong, Polish history isn\'t my most knowledgable topic). And again, you\'re really focusing on the earliest date in which homosexuality was decriminalized and not the qualitative changes that were made to better incorporate us into society. Yes, it was decriminalized in 32, but the rest of the progress was made during the years in which Poland was communist, and after the fall of Communism in Poland that progress was dismantled. Today, Poland does not recognize same sex marriages nor grants same sex civil unions, and approximately 1/3 of the country is made up of ""LGBT free zones"". Honestly I\'m glad you brought Poland up because it\'s such a perfect example of my point.', '(part 2, wouldn\'t let me post it all as one comment)   Ok, let\'s take a look at that picture:  During the McCarthy era in the 40s and 50s (and before, this was used against child labor laws and women\'s suffrage in the 30s as well) baseless accusations of being a communist became incredibly common, and deliberate attempts were made to get the public to associate various social movements with communism in an attempt to discredit them, whether or not those links were actually present. The state department took actions to remove communists and ""homosexuals"" in the red and lavender scares respectively, resulting in thousands losing their jobs with executive order 10450. McCarthy himself is quoted as saying ""If you want to be against McCarthy, boys, you\'ve got to be either a Communist or a cocksucker."" You could be interrogated and fired, or be one of the 20% of Americans who had to sign an oath attesting to your ""moral purity"" until at least 1958.  This led to the start of LGBT struggles in the 60s, with a protest at the whitehouse in 1965, then Stonewall in 1969. Stonewall birthed many LGBT groups that were explicitly socialist or supported socialist groups. The Gay Liberation Front was formed that same year. They had barrels of ink dumped on them and were beaten by the police in a demonstration that October. In 1970, two members of the GLF Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera (whose names you should recognize if you\'re familiar with stonewall) formed the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, and that same year also saw the founding of Lavender Menace. All three groups adopted socialist stances. Huey Newton of the Black Panther Party, notable socialist, publically voiced his support for the GLF after its founding.  Demonstrations and violent incidents continued throughout the 70s, notably one instance in LA in 79 where the police Vice Squad entered Pegs Place, shouted ""let\'s get the dykes"", and proceeded to beat the patrons. Then throughout the 80s there was the AIDS epidemic which was deliberately made worse by the Reagan administration, case numbers increased throughout the 90s and resulted in the deaths of thousands by its peak in 2004. While on paper that one specific law may not have been enforced, there were other legal restrictions that *were* enforced, and it\'s not like the USA was particularly good to LGBT people during this time outside of the law either.  I think you\'re too focused on the earliest date in which being gay is technically no longer illegal, and ignoring many of the other things that go into making society a place in which LGBT people are accepted and can thrive. While communist states weren\'t all perfect all of the time, it was socialism that was spearheading much of that crucial second part, they were doing it earlier than others at the time, and when non-socialist states adopted similar stances it was largely due to the work of socialists within those states.']"

However, socialists and socialist writers were not opposed to capitalism. It was a necessary development for organization of industry which was the true source of prosperity. Socialism, for them, was a necessary evolution for capitalism so that the society could achieve the benefits that were promised by writers like Smith. I don't think Smith's opinions or observations would have been much different than Marx's had he lived to see the conditions of factory and mill workers and miners in the 19th century.""]"

That\'s not a bargain.""  There\'s nothing ""pro Putin"" about anything he said. He\'s asking why the political class in DC is touting war with Russia after China killed millions and continues to act hostile towards us. But no, DC obsesses over Putin irrationally and many of them would have had Americans in Ukraine a long time ago if they could\'ve gotten away with it. Being critical of DC politicians\' obsession with Putin isn\'t ""pro Putin"". If fact it\'s quite pitiful how much you leftists have obsessed over him all because Hillary Clinton used him as a scapegoat for her Russian collusion/Steele Dossier scam. Meanwhile China is killing millions and running concentration camps. But whatever. You\'re obsessed and beyond help', 'Trump\'s entire first impeachment was illegally withholding funds already alloted to Ukraine\'s military in order to force Zelenskyy to cough up bullshit on Hunter Biden. And Trump is known to do a shit ton of business with Russia, which is why he wanted to yank the US out of NATO if he got a second term.   You were doing so well until you completely ignored that I mentioned how few allies Putin has and what kind of military support they have to offer him.   There\'s also the matter that he\'s got damn few things to offer them to get them to give that support vs what the US and all our allies could do in retaliation.   I gave *one* off the cuff, off the top of my head example with North Korea, not a full Pentagon level briefing of all the powers that could get involved.   I will say this in closing. We waited a few years to get involved in WW2, and our inaction got our Navy blown to hell in her own home. If we\'d been all in against Hitler right from the jump, that might not have happened and he might not have killed 12million people.   Obama blew Crimea. That was 8yrs ago. Now Putin wants another chunk of a democracy that doesn\'t belong to him. How long do we sit on our asses this time because ""wah, my money"" and how many Americans die when he uses Ukraine to go after our NATO ally Poland and we send troops in the way we\'re sworn to?', 'So it‚Äôs basically this: Russia and Ukraine have been at odds since always but maintained their borders.

So Biden as prez and Zelenskyy who Biden has already had many dealings with business wise get together and say ‚ÄúLook I have a plan, let‚Äôs Poke the Bear aka Putin and Rowling up just enough to agitate.‚Äù  So Ukraine starts lobbing missiles across the border, just enough to force Putin to act as to not look completly weak.   Then it continues to the point where Putin starts making threats and then must act on said threat when it doesn‚Äôt stop.  Putin finally takes action and moves in on Ukraine Border as promised with no immediate threat from the sitting US President. ( I believe trump once said ‚ÄúI will burn your pretty Kremlin to the ground if you *dream* about invading Ukraine)  Once Putin crossed the border. is Officials immediately call for aid, backed by American media who rally newsreaders to the cause.   Articles are written about the ‚Äúhorros‚Äù and atrocities of Putins actions but seem to use old photos of the victims which are used from completely unreleased incidents.  Americans see the fake photos and get angry causing them to further back some kind of relation against Russia for their crimes.  Meanwhile additional aid is called and and millions of dollars begin flooding into the pockets of Ukraine aid associations.  US Finally begins signing bills for multi billion dollar aid packages to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù Ukraine in their way against Russia. And then happens again several times over and over.  Gas prices surge for reasons that literally have nothing to do with Russia but now with Putin as a straw man anything from gas tic@inflation@ can be blamed on it and allow companies to take it in.  Biden cabinet and Zelenskyy begin lining their pockets with this money as the response for help has been overwhelming.  Biden knows good and well he could freeze Russia dead in their tracks with military night and tariffs but again it‚Äôs important to keep just a soft enough hand so that Putin can have his way just enough to allow the aid funds to continue flowing in.  That‚Äôs basically the grift and we‚Äôve seen just enough minor leaks in the narrative to let slip that is in fact what is in play here, like Zelenskyys wife dropping 40k at a single store during a shopping spree in Paris.

In theory, the ""women are wonderful"" effect *could* translate into significant real-world preferential treatment: for example, it could mean that women should be in charge because of course you\'re going to put the best, least corruptible people in charge. In real life, that\'s not the case; it does not seem to translate into preferential treatment, and in fact often the opposite. In the case of sexual assault (since you bring it up), many women are ""believed"" but still blamed; [studies have shown that people do engage in more victim-blaming for rape](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20587449/) than other crimes. Seeing women as morally superior doesn\'t seem to translate into taking crimes against them more seriously--in fact, only *less* seriously. Being seen as morally superior may just mean being held more responsible even for what other people do. Not an actual benefit.  One thing that I think will help to understand about the positive/negative stereotype thing is that most people don\'t really have well-thought-out, internally consistent systems of belief. Instead, they have a haphazard collection of socially accepted commonplaces, post hoc justifications, and random thoughts that occur to them one day that are often the result of confirmation bias and convenience, which are then doled out when the relevant social situations arise. These are not only random but also often even quite contradictory and nonsensical when taken together. So people don\'t actually, consistently over time believe that men are bumbling idiots; they don\'t hold it as a consistent principle. Who would put the bumbling idiots in charge of every major institution for thousands of years? People\'s real beliefs and values are in their actions. This is why I recommend thinking about the *function* of beliefs over their *content*.  (As an aside, re: the bumbling idiot thing specifically, [men report being labeled incompetent because of their gender in the workplace about one-fourth as often as women do (6% vs 23%)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/12/14/gender-discrimination-comes-in-many-forms-for-todays-working-women/). So, not something that shows up IRL or inhibits men\'s ability to provide for themselves to a significant degree.)  As for group solidarity and identification, I think you\'ve got it backwards; this is something men have plenty of. (Keep in mind that ""solidarity"" and ""identification"" are different from emotional closeness or intimacy.) For example, [one study showed that while men and women had equal empathy for a hypothetical rape victim, men had higher empathy for the perpetrator](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-08-victim-blamers-empathy-perpetrators.html).  Women having stronger social support networks than men is also a relatively recent phenomenon and probably a product of women entering the public sphere more fully. In most if not all patriarchal societies, the domestic confinement of women was common and women were not able to mix with other women to the same degree that men could mingle with each other. It\'s reasonable to think that relegation to the ""private sphere"" cut off a lot of women\'s connections to each other and reduced group identification.  A little further afield, but you might look at our closest relatives: chimpanzees and bonobos. Chimps have a ""male-dominant"" society where complex hierarchies of power are maintained through violence and male chimps often work in concert with each other while female chimps are ""divided"" and do not seem to have the same group mentality, working individually instead. In contrast, bonobos have a ""female-dominant"" society where the opposite is true: female bonobos have a strong sense of group solidarity or ""coalition formation"" while the male bonobos act more as individuals. It\'s the reason bonobos, unlike chimps, don\'t have rape: although male bonobos attempt it, female bonobos quickly come to each other\'s aid, while the male bonobos do not. Historically, human societies have been much more like those of chimps than bonobos.']"

That would be acceptable.  Also its not a parasite. Your offspring literally cannot be a parasite.', ""I'm not the one calling my own child a parasite."", ' I said that science cannot answer ""WHY"" we exist, I did not say science cannot answer ""HOW"" we exist.  There\'s a difference between why and how.  Sexual reproduction is HOW we exist.  Sexual reproduction does not explain WHY we exist at all (aka what our purpose is).   Why we exist is a philosophical and/or religious question.  Science cannot tell us what our purpose is.   produce.  Yes but using that as a reason alone to claim the fetus isn\'t a parasite seems very arbitrary. It\'s a moral claim. He already admitted that pregnancy and the fetus does fit the general definitions of parasitism used by many biologists.  The only reason he disagrees is because he believes that the purpose of women is to be pregnant.  The only reason he doesn\'t believe it to be a parasite is because of his personal views on women.   Ah! So you\'re admitting that it\'s parasitic!   But this still does not assign purpose to any person.  The professor said that the only reason he doesn\'t consider the ZEF a parasite is because he views women being pregnant as fulfilling their genetic purpose.  This framework leaves out so many different individuals!  It leaves out infertile women. Are infertile women ""genetic failures"" simply because they cannot get pregnant?  What about lesbian women? Are they genetic failures? Gay men?  What about menopausal women? Are they no longer worthy of consideration because they cannot reproduce anymore?  Tokophobic women? Are they genetic failures wirh no purpose?  Someone in his comment section said the same thing:  *""Did you really mean to say that women exist to get pregnant, and it is ‚Äúthe ultimate biological purpose of (her) life?‚Äù I am sincerely asking for a clarification because it is an assertion with serious implications.""*  *""I am a gay man. Have I abdicated the biological purpose of my life? Then, we have infertile people, who would have no purpose at all. By this, I mean you seem to have overstepped by giving the science of reproduction a universal, philosophical value.""*  *""Do human lives need a biological purpose?""*  *""If ‚Äúbiological purpose‚Äù exists, then it can mean only reproduction. If that were true, we‚Äôd be on a quick and slippery slope toward to an over-crowded planet, and our own extinction.""*  *""In that light, we are better off a species if a significant minority of people fail to achieve this purpose, and a significant number of women fail to reproduce. But that brings the debate full circle because it means that all women do not inherently share a biological mandate.""*  Basically, this user is pointing out how over-reproduction is actually a bad thing and how it\'s evolutionary advantageous for there to be people who don\'t reproduce.  The professor didn\'t disagree with him.  Too add, Women are at peak fertility for about a 1/3 of their lifetime. I do not buy that our purpose for existing hinges on something we can do only 30 percent of our life.   Ah! You said ""those who have this feeling"" which means that you\'re recognizing that there are those who don\'t.    Absolutely false. I already explained to you that parasites do often benefit the host. Not re-explaining, I\'ll just link the comment once again:https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/zoi61d/what_is_so_bad_about_convenience_abortions/j0vsk1s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3  An example of a parasite that benefits the body is hookworms. Hookworms provide the body many benefits but they\'re still classified as parasites due to the harm they impose as well.   It makes sense to the plenty of biologists in the sources I sent you.   Even the professor you sent me said that he can see why biologists refer to it as parasitic, he just doesn\'t agree based on his own misconceptions about the purpose of women.   No, even in the comment section, he admits that part of his answer is due to philosophical reasoning.  *""There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being reductive. Reductionism is a vital tool for scientific and **philosophical understanding.**""*  So, he has already admitted that his answer is partly philosophical, it\'s not purely scientific.  What he is using is called Genetic Reductionism which is a type of Biological Determinism and it\'s highly problematic!  [Genetic reductionism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_reductionism): Genetic reductionism is the belief that understanding genes is sufficient to understand all aspects of human behavior.[1] It is a specific form of reductionism and of biological determinism, based on a perspective which defines genes as distinct units of information with consistent properties.[2] It also covers attempts to define specific phenomena in exclusively genetic terms, as in the case of the ""warrior gene"".[3]  The concept has been criticized by many biologists.[4] According to Affifi (2017), ""With the discoveries of pleiotropy and epistasis, cracks in the reductionist paradigm emerged even before the rise of molecular biology, but the full extent of the interdependency and flexible adaptivity of the genome has really come to light in the past 10 years...""[5] The genetic reductionist perspective can be appropriate when used to identify changes in specific genetic loci that cause differences in a given phenotype.[6]  [Biological determinism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_determinism): Biological determinism, also known as genetic determinism,[1] is the belief that human behaviour is directly controlled by an individual\'s genes or some component of their physiology, generally at the expense of the role of the environment, whether in embryonic development or in learning.[2] Genetic reductionism is a similar concept, but it is distinct from genetic determinism in that the former refers to the level of understanding, while the latter refers to the supposedly causal role of genes.[3]   Biological determinism has been associated with movements in science and society including **eugenics, scientific racism, and the debates around the heritability of IQ,[4] the basis of sexual orientation,[5] and sociobiology.[6]**  The professor you sent is using a philosophy that justifies eugenics, racism, and rape.   He admitted in his answer that he doesn\'t believe that animals can rape each- other (despite zoologista saying otherwise). He believes that those are just different mating strategies in order to further our ""genetic purpose""']"

The parties essentially flipped on the issue with the Civil Rights Act and the Southern Strategy.', ""It's pretty simple, in response to the Southern alienation caused by LBJ publicly working alongside MLK on, and signing, the CRA, certain GOP leaders started to effectuate a strategy to seize those voters. The first candidate was Goldwater, who captured the deep South running an explicitly anti-CRA campaign, cracking Democrats' long established dominance. Followed by Nixon, who, not being able to outflank George Wallace's social conservatism/racism, and not alienate the other half of the country, split the South with Wallace. With Wallace out of the picture in 72, Nixon dominated the South.   But in 76, it was a - seemingly - authentic good ol' baptist, Southern Democrat, versus an Ivy league Northern moderate - ostensibly a legacy Republican. One that refused to deploy the Southern Strategy, and thus lost handily to the true, blue Southerner. Of course, once Carter got in office, he governed as a social liberal, and the South, having learned its lesson about idpol - at least for 16 years, kicked him to the curb in favor of the California actor, who opposed the CRA and VRA, and lauded Jefferson Davis."", 'There is no southern switch.. lmao. This is a fabricated idea from the 1950s &amp; 60s leftists presented as a talking point to mentally enslave the black vote, a time when democrats were staunchly opposed to granting civil rights to black people and republicans were fighting &amp; introducing legislation to grant civil rights to the black public. Read LBJ\'s speeches, his advisors had openly proposed that if they were forced by the republicans to give blacks a right to vote, that they could easily manipulate them into voting for democrats for generations because they\'re not intelligent. This was the attitude of the left in the 1960s &amp; 1970s. They just make up history &amp; teach it as if it\'s real. Like the currently taught flawed conceptual structure of the political compass charts.    There was, however, an Unconstitutional period of reconstruction. After the Republicans won the Civil War they suspended the rights of States &amp; Democrats in the south &amp; practiced a unmitigated form of southern colonialism. State &amp; business leaders from various parts of the northern, republican party faction &amp; the American military were sent down to take over industries and be heads of states &amp; principalities in the south, they seized land from the southern slave owners, democrat politicians, &amp; vocal proponents of states rights... and they gifted it/sold it dirt cheap to wealthy northerners to encourage Republicans to take over the hierarchy in the south. Servants &amp; slaves were ""freed"" but with no where to go they were encouraged to go north, where they work like slaves in the newly industrialized cities of the north. The Civil War debt was the beginning of the debt/foreign funding crisis &amp; push into foreign owned central banking socialist system that fully materialized in 1913 and still plagues America today.    The ideological basis of the parties has never changed. Republicans are still Liberal individualists who want small government &amp; individual rights guaranteed by threat of force if necessary, and the democrats are still mostly statist-leaning Liberals who trust the government to guarantee those rights without force.  Many on the left, especially politicians &amp; leaders, have shifted so far to the left they\'ve adopted collectivist philosophies, which is more focused on in mob rule &amp; state-managed economies. Collectivism is the borderline of facism, it\'s anti-individual rights, anti-freedom, has until 20 years ago been considered anti-american, and there is an argument that it is inherently anti-humanist.']"

And yes, CS covers all of that minus medical, but most divorced children are on Medicaid till they are 18 under the family medical act and therefore they have unlimited free medical care with mere copays and prescription costs, which can be high, but its nothing compared to being an adult and needing an arm and three legs to pay for medical.   So yes. You are the custodial parent by force, you are kidnapping his children and refusing him access. If you are not able to support yourself then why should you have children in the first place? Give the children to him, he clearly had no issue supporting all of you prior to getting wage gouged.   If the man wanted to fight for custody and you got custodial parent status anyway then you don\'t get to complain about caring for the child. You fought to be one doing this shit, you don\'t get to be ""poor me, give me some money cause I do all this"".   Now if he wants nothing to do with the kids then that\'s a different thing altogether. If he didn\'t want custody or split custody and just wants out of the family altogether then let him sign his rights away. But if he tried to be their father, and lost, and now gun wielding people are backing you up in enforcing his state sponsored kidnapping and wage slavery, then yeah, you should be ashamed that you can\'t afford rent and it makes you an unfit parent.  These things are nuanced, of course, but at the end of the day if a man pays child support it is for the child, not you, that is called alimony or spousal support.']"

Without all the displacement stuff, which is why we even have this word.  Gentrification is, from what i know and literature i had, always linked to displacement. Maybe Ruth Glass or Klaus Friedrich are names you know. Maybe from where you are from this isnt what people care about.   When you are going to interfere in the process, you are not really having gentrification. Stop calling it like that. Even with the public housing thing you sound like the fuckers that actually prefer poor people getting displaced. Also, one problem. A lot of the improvement in housing quality s done because of a profit motive which lets the rent skyrocket. If there isnt enough prey for these ""developers"", it isnt really going to be gentrified. Public housing would short cut the process right at its beginning. So without rich people moving into the quality housing, all the other effects you spoke of are not going to happen.  Sprinkeling in some public housing isnt going to do the trick. I have heard enough dreaming about stopping gentrification at the ""right moment"". So we can keep the positive things that surely happen. Do you maybe, just a little bit, see my point? Or do i have to elaborate more?   And i cant believe i have to speak it out loud, but the market does not work our favor. Shocking, right?

Even public housing isnt going to fucking solve it. I cant believe i have to explain it on THIS sub....  A big part of why gentrification is a horrible thing is that people get social problems.

What, you want to grow up keeping your friends as a kid? No, fuck you, your parents get evicted and you have to move away! I let it sound dramatic, because IT IS dramatic!  I dont exactly know how gentrification is going to be made better by public housing. I can imagine a few ways you might think it works, and its all bullshit.   Option 1: Creating mass public housing outside of urban area (Satellite city)  So you have public housing then where people can move to when they get gentrified the fuck out of their trusted neighbourhood so they are atleast not homeless. And maybe their whole neighbourhood moves with them, so social nets arent that fucked. And that happens while gentrifier can do their thing and continue gentrifying and keep """"improving"""" the affected urban area. Sound good, right? Right??  No, you successfully fucking DEPORTED a already vulnerable neighbourhood into underdeveloped, shitty countryside while the rich can enjoy the Infrastructure the poor had to leave behind. With no regard on how the people feel about it or about how their job situation will be fucked because of that. Great. Also, which suburb would allow having a fucking Ghetto next to them? Where i am from you would be as urban planner BOMBARDED with complaints. Not listening to them would be illegal btw, have fun with that. And btw, this public housing will most likely be ugly cuz concrete and glass. Or what? Do you want to build a 16th century palace?? I can assure you that this wont be EVER low income housing then.   Option 2 (cant believe i am wasting Time on this, once again) A) Building public housing IN the city (have luck finding land for that lol)/ B) buying back housing as municipal administration to provide public housing  A) that isnt going to happen on a relevant scale  B) first step might work if the Administration has enough Funds. Most likely they dont. There are also legal limitations to that, depending on which way to go. So you have public housing there to protect the neighbourhood from being displaced. So you wait for Gentrification and its """"positive effects"""" and wow, either it doesnt come because it is still a half Ghetto with public housing not able to be affected by rising rent or the poorer people still living there will be affected by classism, higher costs of living as the prices go up all around and old buisnesses getting kicked out in favor of gentrifiers. There is no reason for gentrification to happen there, also because of topics of attractivity, but i am keeping this bullshit short.     I really dont know what you could imagine else, i dont read minds. And god, good that i cant look into yours', 'Gentrification is residents of an area getting replaced by wealthier people. Fixing up an area is not gentrification. The goal of fixing up an area often is gentrification. With tennant protection laws and rent control you can fix up an area without inducing gentrification.

Public welfare, largely under the jurisdiction of local and district authorities before 1933, was partly transferred by the Nazi government to affiliates of the Nazi party. Particularly to the Nationalsozailistiche Volkswohlfahrt (National Socialist People‚Äôs Welfare Organization‚ÄìNSV). The most important activity was the Winterhilfe (Winter Help), the distribution of money and goods among the poorest population. NSV was funded with a fee charged on the earnings of employed workers, and with quasi-compulsory levies in cash or in kind from farmers, peasants, employers and the middle classes generally (Guillebaud, 1941, pp. 96). Financial control of the Winter Help was in the hands of the Treasurer of the Nazi Party (Pollock, 1938, p. 164), and the compulsory character of the contributions was so clear that they have been 21 Pollock (1938, p. 43-68) provides an extensive revision of the organizational characteristics of the Nazi Party holding of organizations. 22 Nathan (1944a, p. 321) also points out that Education no longer remained the exclusive function of the public school system, but was shifted in part to the Hitler Youth Organization. 23 V√∂ltzer (135, pp. 4-6) offers a thorough revision of the German Labor Front legal configuration. 24 Besides, it also delivered new services such as the leisure program Strength through Joy (Kraft durch Freude).

In 1933/34 the NSV realized 350 million marks, which in 1936/37 grew to 408.3 million marks (Pollock, 1938, p. 138; Guillebaud, 1941, pp. 97). Estimates in Nathan (1944b, p. 94) give figures of Rm. 340 in 1934/35 and 370 after 1937. Reichs-Kredit-Gesellschaft (1939, p. 101) gives an estimate of Rm. 400 million in 1938, according to official statistics. As explained in The Banker (1937, p. 171), the German government had provided Winter Help before the Nazi regime. A comparison between the expenditures of the Reich Winter Relief in 1931 and the Nazi Winter Relief in 1933 ‚Äúshows that this new Nazi organisation has not provided in Winter Help more than the former contribution made by the Reich alone....Under the Nazi system .... a huge apparatus has been created to carry out a service formerly provided as a ‚Äòside-line‚Äô by private and public bodies.‚Äù (p. 171). In short, delivered by private and public bodies before the Nazi regime, Winter Help was completely privatized by the Nazi government and was transferred to a Party Organization. The funding of the service was based on a compulsory scheme of fees and levies. Because of this, the Reich Budget was relieved of the expenditure implied by this social service program.‚Äù']"

Then he told the American people he'd do it earlier (and then moved the goalposts, but that never matters, though, because his voters don't hold it against him, and people that do aren't his voters anyway.)   Immediately after the election was lost, he booted Yesper and replaced him with acting ~~SecDef~~ YesMan Miller (the same guy who issued orders on the 4th of January that the DCNG wasn't to be deployed to the Capitol or issued so much as riot gear without his say so), and they set about trying to get as many troops home from everywhere ASAP.

After all, Ford\'s decision to allow hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees wasn\'t exactly popular either at the time, and Vietnamese refugees in places like Houston weren\'t exactly greeted with open arms.

As we all drank the last bit of mescaline, the faces of everyone looked increasingly greener than that of the cactus itself or the brew that was being consumed.. and as I continued looking the stomach discomfort I had was grown even more intense and as i clutched my stomach feeling as if I would vomit, the faces and bodies of everyone around me began to morph into what resembled grotesque creatures with the features of the cactus spines all over their bodies, and as they looked at me began chanting weird murmurs of something foreign, I couldn\'t understand because I was shaking my head moving my hands in sequences as if saying stay the fuck away from me, it wasn\'t me!

Mesmerized by her glance she took me by the hand and led me towards the festival music venue as we began walking towards the growing louder sound of the performers. We passed by tents of people making noises, and we heard a scream and I thought what fuck is that? Then Mooner said, ""Maybe someone\'s trying to extract some of the chrome,"" he said while laughing. Fucking hilarious, you think it\'s all shits and giggles until someone giggles and shits I thought.  Mooner\'s joke was only funny to him unless the joke turned out to be on him, I\'m pretty sure he wouldn\'t have been laughing then. As we approached the stage we saw a culmination of dancing hippies, fire handlers, and people gathered together at the stage swaying together as if being captivated in some type of unshakable trance.

Same story in Vietnam, except Vietnam was really bad tank country and there were hardly any enemy tanks for them to run into.  I‚Äôm not sure if they killed any Iraqi tanks, but I know USMC M60s participated in desert storm. Still, most of the major combat against big Iraqi maneuver formations was done by the army as the marine corps tank battalions were there for infantry support, while the army had entire mechanized formations of tanks and mechanized infantry that can be used for giant fast maneuvers that tend to result in more tank combat.  I would assume that quote is a bit of hyperbole, given Oryx says Ukraine has destroyed or captured over 1500 Russian tanks so it would be a little iffy to attribute a significant portion of that to one person.

In the US it's apparently 99+%, worldwide apparently ~90% of livestock are raised on factory farms.  The harm of factory farming isn't due just to cow farts, that's a very small part of it.  It's the whole package.  It's the bacteria resistance from the antibiotics administered to livestock to keep them healthy in typically miserable conditions.  It's the manure pits that stink up areas for miles.  It's the increased water and energy demands implicit to raising animals because animals are higher on the trophic scale relative to growing plants directly for human consumption.  Above all else the harm of factory farming is arguably what it represents, namely the systemic objectification of thinking feeling beings for sake of selfish profit.  If it's to be regarded as OK to objectify thinking feeling beings why shouldn't it be OK to similarly objectify humans?  The challenge becomes to rationalize how the abuse is OK in the one case but not the other.  Maybe humans might be regarded as having rights but not other animals.  But why should humans have rights if other animals shouldn't?  Is it just that the strong make the rules?  But might makes right isn't a sound ethical theory because it doesn't suggest what the mighty should do besides maybe seeking to become mightier.  To escape the circularity requires imagining some greater purpose and if all sentient beings shouldn't embrace that greater purpose than any who'd be motivated to that divisive end would make themselves enemies to all beings they'd so exclude.  To embrace factory farming is to embrace a cynical, short-sighted, and unsound way of thinking.  Below is shown how most pigs are killed for slaughter.  Did you know that's how it is?  Do you care how existence seems from the perspective of these pigs?  https://vimeo.com/147914620"", ""I mean philosophically speaking, what does any of that mean? Where does the line get drawn for which living beings to eat and which not to? Plants are alive as well. They breathe and eat and reproduce and then we eat them. Ofc I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. But they're alive. And I'm also not trying to point out any hypocrisy, Because in doing so would I not be? We each draw our lines of what is and isn't alright to eat. Cows have been... Ruined by humanity, the same way pigeons were. If you didn't know, by the way, pigeons were heavily domesticated back in the day because they were very useful as messengers. Pigeons are now considered plague. They bring upon disease and many people kill them like rats (because they basically are the air equivalent of them)... So then what will my happen to the cows? We'd have to make them extinct. A farmer would have to take care of all their cows until they die because they would be unable to survive properly in the wild. Humanity has damaged the environment to such an extent, that regardless of what we do now, the cows will remain in one way or another, at the very least for the lifetime of the youngest cow today. At most forever if they are to have the fate of the pigeons. So in what Respect do we propose to end the practice? I like the idea of lab grown meat because it might make me feel better about myself and my carbon footprint, but in the end the farms will stay and I doubt production will decrease highly until the lab grown variety becomes a standard, which is unlikely to happen anytime soon.   On a side note: what about reptiles? Would you eat a reptile? They don't have emotions, (this much is true evolutionarily) so while they would probably feel pain, who's to say  a plant cannot? Does the plant not release smells in order to avoid getting killed? Is this not why onions male us cry?   Why, then, did I choose to write this long winding paragraph for a random stranger on Reddit. Am I justifying my habits? Maybe so. Am i tired of people acting all self-righteous about their diet? Possibly. But I believe the answer lies in my sleep deprivation and the fact that I've been at the airport for three hours and I don't know when I'll be able to board my plane. As a matter of fact, they told me to fuck right off when I tried to check my baggage in."", ""I am trying my hardest to live off of the land, meaning growing and producing as much of my food as possible.  I also forage.   I live pretty far north.  Due to the climate where I live it is almost impossible for me to grow and forage enough calories to stay alive. I am not vegetation, if you are that is fine, but my goal is to stop using the grocery store for as much food as possible. I cannot be self sufficient on a vegetarian diet in the climate I live in.  It is very judgmental to assume what I am doing is wrong.    Because I know that trucking food grown on factory farms is bad for the environment and bad for me, I have chosen this lifestyle.  No one in 1000s of years has survived in northern climate on a vegetarian diet.   My growing season here is about 100 days, sometimes less.  So I raise chickens, goats, and rabbits.  I also can, dry food, forage and hunt.     The beautiful thing is that my goats eat almost everything.  They are eco-friendly on a small scale.  They eat the weeds, and then give manure and milk and meat.  That is why cultures all over the world use them in agriculture.  I chose them over pigs and cows because I live in the bush and don't have the space to grow food for food and the goats literally will eat what grows here.  They eat poison ivy and brambles like it's hay to a cow.  No one enjoys dispatching an animal unless they have unresolved mental issues.  But I am trying my best to live sustainably as my ancestors did, and I am living naturally in tune with nature as best as I can, and that includes raising meat.    I am fairly certain that my carbon footprint is very low living like this and it would be much higher if I was eating vegetarian from the grocery store because I literally cannot grow enough calories to stay alive here and those trucks from the factory farms have a long way to go to get here.

The wrongness of bestiality is not the harm to the animal, but the insult to the dignity of humanity to go to such lows.

Instead in the modern day it‚Äôs hookup culture and the lopsided nature of hookup culture.

There is data on this such as partner count especially once corrected for only heterosexual counts and correcting for men who increase reported counts and women who reduce their reported counts. This then shows an interesting phenomenon of 50 percentile women having much higher partner counts than 50 percentile men. This is only possible by having the low and high ends be extreme for men, the high status men getting to the high hundreds and thousands and many men having low counts.  The changes to marriage up to and including the expectations for partner counts have also shifted that deal by amplifying this effect. There are more women who do not need to place as much value on a No or small partner count and as such but because there is also no restriction on the high status men who can achieve thousands in partner counts, even though there is more partner counts out there, it‚Äôs not being well distributed and instead being concentrated to a small percentage of men.

Poly relationships are way harder to maintain because while we may be able to love multiple other people, we don't have unlimited time to spend and bond with others, which will cause the partners to feel unloved and underappreciated, but it's nothing that can't be fixed with communication, trust, respect and some sacrifices for the sake of the relationship.

All the unvaxxed people get care, while the vaxxed driver at fault is not recorded because he did not suffer injury.)

Questionable ways of accounting for those that ""died at the scene"" and therefore were excluded and for those who may have been vaccinated subsequently:    ¬ß7 Accounting for Scene Deaths The study examined serious traffic crashes based on emergency care throughout the region and thereby did not include deaths at the scene. In turn, we considered extreme assumptions to examine how results might change based on these missing deaths. Specifically, traffic statistics for this setting (602 total deaths in Ontario, 2018) suggested that 50 total deaths might have occurred in our study during follow-up (602/12). Taking into account the 8 deaths that were included, therefore, we estimated potentially 42 total deaths at the scene (50‚àí8). Making an extreme assumption and assigning all these deaths to the vaccinated group yielded minimal changes to final results. In particular, the observed event count increased from a total of 5000 crashes to 5042 crashes, equivalent to an absolute risk of 535 per million (rather than 530 per million). This observed absolute risk was still substantially lower than the observed risk of 912 per million in the unvaccinated group. These results suggested that extreme assumptions about the deaths at the scene make minimal difference to final estimates of relative risk. ¬ß8 Accounting for Later Vaccinations The study examined vaccination status based on records on July 31, 2021 and did not include possible later vaccination that might have eventually occurred. In turn, we retrieved information on these subsequent vaccinations and considered extreme assumptions to examine how results might change based on the crossover cases. Specifically, we found 219,740 individuals who were eventually vaccinated from the cohort of 1,8450,290 who had been classified as unvaccinated. These individuals accounted for 155 total traffic crashes during follow-up. Making an extreme assumption and assigning all individuals to the vaccinated group yielded minimal changes to final results. In particular, the observed event count increased from a total of 5000 crashes to 5155 crashes, equivalent to an absolute risk of 534 per million (rather than 530 per million). This observed absolute risk was still substantially lower than the recalculated risk of 939 per million in the unvaccinated group. These results suggested that extreme assumptions about possible eventual vaccination during follow-up make minimal difference to final estimates of relative risk.']"

I think it\'s worth bringing up because it makes it so you can\'t relax on a ""tokenism bad"" position. What harm does tokenism do to this story? Why does the author inserting this character trait hurt the story instead of help it?  Also, maybe we just like certain tokens because we agree with the politics behind them, so it doesn\'t take us out of the story', 'I know this is a side track but I‚Äôd also argue there‚Äôs a number of situations where the same could be said for original characters.  Without diversifying writing, directing, and production staff, we increasingly see situations where new media is created with diverse characters written by the same old storytellers.   This has led to a situation (IMO) of almost surreptitious co-opting/colonization of diverse characters.   This is especially true when people call out the lack of diversity in shows where lack of diversity may be an important context.   An example: there was some criticism of the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, a show focused on affluent Jews in 1950s NYC, for not featuring a diverse cast expected from NYC-based shows. However, the push for the white show creators to just write some POC characters is both baffling in terms of appropriate representation of POC narratives but also because the lack of POC visibility is absolutely in-keeping with the perspective of the protagonists. It actually *tells* us something about racism and segregation and ethnic insularity that there *isn‚Äôt* diversity in the show - shoehorning it in provides a sense that the characters being presented had awareness, consciousness, or sympathies that may be ahistorical and subsequently produce a whitewashed outcome solely designed to comfort modern viewers.  So I‚Äôd say that even with original characters, story should rule - white creators are often not the best people to write non-white characters and not every setting is an appropriate context for the inclusion of diversity that obfuscates the reality of the experiences of ‚Äúdiverse people‚Äù.   We shouldn‚Äôt encourage diversity in every story, we should encourage more support for diverse creators who will naturally create more diverse work.']"

On the other hand, blacks make up about 38.5 percent of inmates. Whites are at about 58 percent, which fits demographically.  So do we have a ""locking minorities up"" problem or do we have a black crime problem? The most lax or strict DA couldn\'t change the basic facts, especially as astoundingly pronounced they are.

It is that they do not know about the [return of the dragons](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Investigation:_Current_Status). Not that they don\'t know anything about dragons.   I don\'t think you\'re above list of the dragon empire is quite as impressive as you think it is:  Atmora was more of an annexation, the Nords already worshiped the dragons and there are no stories of a war being needed for them to take over.  Akavir being ""conquered"" is dubious and incomplete. At best they only conquered whatever part of the continent the Tsaeci lived on at the time, the extent of which we don\'t know, and were then repelled by the Tsaeci through unknown means. The Kamal, Ka Po\'Tun, and Tang Mo all remained unconquered.  And if we\'re throwing out lore we think is bad, allow me to throw out ESO. The Elsweyr chapter in particular not only takes a hammer to the timeline (which the Dragon war itself already threw into chaos) but its also just bad. It\'s pretty much a copy paste of the Skyrim story complete with their own version of the Greybeards and Dragonrend. Even if we don\'t discount it, Elsweyr was conquered by a different group of dragons and it happened when Elsweyr was split between 16 different kingdoms. The dragons were also defeated by like four dudes.  I don\'t think this paints a picture of a Dragon Army uber weapon. If anything it makes the Falmer look quite weak. The Dwemer, Chimer, Ayleids, Bosmer, Dirreni, and Altmer all seem to be untouched by the dragons. What\'s worse is that after the Nords defeat the dragons, they manage to successfully invade Morrowind, High Rock, and the Nibenay Valley defeating the Chimer, Direnni, and Ayleids. Why could they do this without the dragons, but couldn\'t with them?  We don\'t know much about what the Falmer had at their disposal, or really much about them at all. I don\'t think the fact that they fell is proof that the Altmer don\'t have some trump card against dragons. By most accounts, they\'re the cause for the Void Nights so they\'ve clearly got some powerful mojo. And if we don\'t throw out ESO, we already know the Khajiit have Dragonrend horns.', 'Skyrims lore, specifically ""The Great War"" by Justianus Quintius, lists the detail that Titus II was rumored to wield Goldbrand during the retaking of the Imperial city. This is what the basis of the Elder Scrolls Legends was. Now you may argue that this is just a rumor, but this isn\'t real history it is literature. The rumor was put there to tell us something.   The evidence is that despite the innate drive to do so and historic accounts of them conquering others, they were unable to even break out of Falmer territory, let alone conquer all of Nirn. Their is also ample evidence of the remaining elves wielding incredible powers that could allow them to defeat the dragons including the Void Nights, which even MK says was done by the Thalmor.   We know the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller still exists because we encounter it in Skyrim. The Blades know of it too, which actually provides a bit of a wrinkle in this whole discussion as well.  If even one exists and even if it is destroyed taking down a dragon, the Thalmor would then have two more horns to use and that number would double unless/until the LDB realizes what\'s going on and forces his remaining dragons to have their horns cut.', ' We don\'t talk about Legends. The Thalmor lore in that game is fundamentally nonsensical and the entire thing is told through the perspective of a narrator of questionable reliability.    They conquered Skyrim, Elsweyr, Atmora and Akavir. That\'s a pretty expansive empire.   And conquering Skyrim, by the way, meant going to war with the Falmer too. Whom were elves.   We know for a fact that the Elves don\'t have a trump card when it comes to dragons because there\'s an entire quest in Skyrim about finding out what the Thalmor know about the dragons and the answer is ""basically nothing.""    There is no reason to assume he *required* the Numidium. The US used nukes to force Japan to surrender, that doesn\'t mean they couldn\'t have won conventionally.

I read the article and all I saw was some university study making a recommendation.', 'I can 100% guarantee there has been a drill sergeant who has forced some poor recruit to refer to him as Drill Sergeant Sprinkleberry with a 100% straight face, no cracking up or anything or else, just because of an offhand comment that recruit made', ""There is no universe in which junior officers and/or NCOs know how to command large bodies of men together with managing the incredibly complex logistics and supply chains while maintaining a universally agreed-upon command structure.  You have to know virtually nothing at all of military history to imagine that this is not so.    A great example comes directly from the US Civil War wherein the top US general, Robert E. Lee, decided to side with the Confederacy and then proceeded to kick the shit out of the Union forces for the first two years of the war *in spite* of having a numerically inferior force that fought with no real resupply in men and materiel.    Lee and Jackson were basically 7 and 0 against the Union until Gettysburg when, through the attrition of terrible generals, the Union, in Meade, finally started fighting with good leadership.    Once Grant and Sherman came back from the west to take over the Army of the Potomac, it was basically game over for Lee and the Confederacy since Grant and Sherman were outstanding leaders who knew how to get shit done.    Again, the point is that senior officers are far more important than anything that happens at the level of junior officers or NCOs.    The lower ranks can have their opinions, but who will command them if they decide to walk away from existing command structure?    You?  Me?  Why should you be in charge when we're the same rank?    Do you see the problem?  It's organizational on a giant scale and there isn't any way that individual actors at the level of junior officers and NCOs can manage it.    Again, sorry to say, but only generals know how to run armies just like only admirals know how to run carrier groups.    You know nothing about military history if you don't recognize that this is true.    As an example, who the fuck do you think, among junior officers and NCOs, is capable of docking an aircraft carrier and getting it fully refueled and resupplied?  Do you think that docking an aircraft carrier is easy, that nearly anyone can do it without practice?  Are you smoking crack?

I think the thing is that basically *every* stereotype has to ring true to some extent, and ""money grubbing Jew"" isn\'t a stereotype that is totally without some basis in reality. (To avoid appearances of anti-semitism, I\'ll add that ""money-grubbing x"" is actually a really common global stereotype applied to any group of people who are perceived as being richer than another group. It\'s easy to see people you think are richer than you as being money-grubbing, whereas your own avarice is just a basic level of respect that everyone should be entitled to). I see ""entitled nice guy"" as not being all that different, to be honest. It has a basis in reality, but it isn\'t descriptive of the majority of men by any stretch of the imagination. It\'s just that the ones who *do* fit that stereotype stand out as being particularly salient, and the existence of an easy narrative to fit them into makes it easy for us to remember those salient examples.   The point is that stereotypes are about perception, and perceptions can both become self-reinforcing on the part of the perceiver *and* influence the behavior of the perceived. How many people aren\'t straight and direct about what they desire because they\'re afraid that said desire might seem to others to be stereotypical of their group? How many men deny that they\'re just interested in a woman for her body because they don\'t want to seem like an objectifying womanizer? Maybe that\'s an aside, but the point is that every group that has stereotypes about itself is aware of those stereotypes, and that awareness impacts how they behave. At least that\'s what I think.    I definitely agree that it isn\'t vanishingly small. Having spent some time being politically active in a very liberal city, my estimate is that about 20% of the coalition that calls itself broadly ""progressive"" or ""liberal"" in the United States fits into that group. Like, I don\'t think it\'s totally fair to tar Barack Obama with that label, but about a fifth of the people who voted for him can be reasonably labeled as SJWs, and probably a similar proportion of the people he might have appointed to cabinet positions.   A fifth isn\'t a useful majority by any stretch of the imagination--not in the way that the 80% of Republicans who identify as ""strongly conservative"" is--but it\'s enough to really impact things, especially since that fifth is the most likely to show up screaming to something, or to throw yogurt on a painting in a museum. People in that category often behave outrageously, and believe outrageous things, so it\'s totally understandable that a significant number of people are outraged by them.   To bring this full circle, I think a big part of the problem with SJWs (sorry for the term) as a group of political actors is that they\'re aware of the stereotype, and use that awareness to deny its validity. ""That\'s just a right-wing, reactionary talking point"" is a common argument against anyone who raises concerns about the behavior of progressive activists. They\'ll use that argument even in the midst of behaving exactly the way Tucker Carlson says they behave.', 'Yeah, but that sounds a lot like a stereotype, not a real person :)', 'I thought that was just a stereotype']"

Although there were hundreds of thousands of regular citizens demonstrating against the government, the coup d‚Äôetat was the work of a few small, violent nationalist organizations based in the western, European-facing part of the country.    Yanukovych had been primarily elected by the Russian-speaking population in the eastern part of the country. In the aftermath of the coup, violent Ukrainian nationalist militias kidnapped, beat, tortured and killed hundreds, probably thousands, of suspected Russia-sympathizers, and the new government immediately took action to antagonize and marginalize the ethnic Russia part of the population (eg, removing Russian as a national language, and creating a holiday to honor the anti-Russian - and anti-Pole, and anti-Jew, etc - fascist leader Stepan Bandera.)   Whether or not the US was directly responsible for orchestrating the coup, there was no doubt that the US backed it, had a decisive say in who served in the new government, and exercised a large degree of control over the politics of post-Maidan Ukraine.    As a result of all this, the ethnic Russians in the east refused to recognize the new government, and when they came under military assault by the Kiev government, they appealed to Russia for help. Russian leaders since the fall of the USSR have consistently expressed concern for the fate of the 25 million Russians who had suddenly found themselves citizens of foreign countries in 1991. Moscow, under both Yeltsin and Putin, has always felt an obligation to ensure their political rights were protected, and of course in this case they agreed to come to the aid of the ethnic Russian separatists in Donbas once they came under attack by the Kiev government.  That‚Äôs the history of the last 8 years, but the roots to the war go much farther back.  TBC', ""The EU deal had strings attached that would have seen austerity and a tightening budget that would negatively affect Ukrainians in the short term. Yanukovych took the deal he thought was better for Ukrainians financially. That was his job. Not every Ukrainian loathed him. Especially in the east where Donetsk voted over 90% for Yanukovych in 2010.   Would you have supported protesters violently forcing Obama out of office after he decided to join the TPP? Because that's basically what the nationalists did to Yanukovych."", 'Ukrainians absolutely loathed Yanukovych when he scuttled the trade agreement with the EU which would have opened EU markets to sell freely in Ukraine and Ukraine markets to sell freely in the EU. Hundreds of billions of dollars hoovered right out of the pockets of the average Ukrainian while Yanukovych spent tens of millions building himself a palace. Without Kremlin interference on par with the 2019 Kazakhstan upraising, the Yanukovych administration had absolutely no pathway to remaining in power. Your historical revisionism is flawed.']"

So if you're struggling check your six for one.)*  But because I was grounded in my body, and come to know what truth feels like... So I rode out that particular storm... And so once the shockwaves settled, I was left with a few names and faces of old colleagues that stood out and who I had strangely and compeltely forgotten up until that point.

When compared to Feudalism, Capitalism was effectively a labor revolution.  It was putting the control of production into the hands of someone other than a hereditary landed aristocracy.  The problem is it calcified, so now it may not be a hereditary landed aristocracy, but in many cases it's not super far off of that, and even when it is, it still has become something which centralizes wealth and power so completely that its differences from early feudalism are becoming more and more superficial all the time.  Also, Smith is absolutely spot on.  I recently read a book about the rise of the landed nobility in early medieval france and it was pretty unequivocal about where it came from.  Basically this or that random person with access to more resources than their neighbors built castles.  These people came to be called Castellans.  Since no one really had the ability to do anything about these castles, Castellans slowly became able to essentially write the social order to their whims via forcing people to be tenants on 'their' land and so on and so forth.  Obviously many of these people wanted their lands and wealth passed onto their children and over a few generations, the landed nobility was born.  Point being they didn't spring fully formed from the ground as nobles.    They were, in many ways, capitalists.  Enterprising and ambitious people that identified a new technical development they could exploit in order to acquire power who then used their newfound power to rewrite the social order to benefit themselves and those like them for the foreseeable future.""]"

The most neutral (as in, it\'s hard to have bullshit in these numbers) is probably the employment percentage. It\'s the percentage of working age population. [See Data Here](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/employment-rate)  We are at approximately the same number (~60%) that we were at in 2018 during Trump. He then had two pretty good years that added another 1.2-1.4% by COVID, and then we plummeted.  Now... we can have a whole conversation about what\'s up with US employment rate, considering the really weird comparisons to peer countries [using the same site](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/employment-rate). Germany is at 77.3% while the US is at 59.9%?  (The fact that the unemployment rate in Germany is 5.3% and 3.7% in the US is, uh, a little odd looking at those employment rates... this is where the ""calling bullshit on unemployment %"" stuff comes from, and I think for good reason)   Agreed, by and large. COVID destroyed jobs, many of them have come back now, but there are aftershocks from the economy freezing (now largely caused by China and our dependence on it) and dethawing being an unpleasant experience.   That is extremely depressing, but is this actually happening? Lord knows there\'s none of that happening around here as far as I know, but there well might be. Inflation always sucks for practically everyone except those that have large amounts of debt.  Inflation sucks, no doubt about it, but I will still blame most of it on Xi and Putin, and to a lesser extent on Trump and Biden.  Also, there\'s a potential sunny side that if there\'s 10% of inflation and 20% drop in house prices, that\'s actually a ~30% drop in house prices.    Extremely. [Here\'s a really short clip kind of highlighting the trouble being created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ_HeCalYq8).   Completely fucking over their tech economy seems like a bigger deal. I have not heard about the details of what you reference, but I somehow doubt the US military would allow China to observe anything too critical.   You just commented on the misery of the poor. Surely gas prices were a part of that. Either he should help the poor or he shouldn\'t, you have to pick on that front.   Well. That\'ll make two recent presidents with loud asshole sons. I do not know what Hunter has exactly been up to, but if you think the war in Ukraine is a consequence of trying to make a few million for Hunter, you\'re like... inches from putting on tin foil and talking about lizard people.   This is VERY possible. But, unfortunately, very much the norm, and not something the Republican party has been any better about. Look at the ""surprisingly great stock investing"" study they did about congress &amp; senate, and it\'s downright wholesome how equally superb both parties were at investing once they had insider info! So nice to see bipartisanship on topics like this.  Anyway, even if Hunter Biden made a billion out of it (he shouldn\'t, and I\'m sure he won\'t), that is no reason for us not to spend 0.1% of our GDP per year to destroy 5%+ of Russias GDP and 0.1% of their POPULATION per year while helping people defend their freedom.  It\'ll fuck over any Chinese plan to start a war, because I am sure they trusted that even if Russia is pretty weak, it\'d tie all of Europe\'s strength and much of the US strength in Europe.  Now? Fuck. We\'ll have to put a harness on the Poles once their shopping spree is done (400 HiMARS systems!?) or they\'d drive to Moscow all by themselves.  Our main ally in Europe is getting far stronger. Our MIC is creating more jobs and landing more and more sales. Our #2 enemy is getting FAAAR weaker (EU will probably 3x in military power in the next 5 years, while Russia in 2025 is probably 20% of what it was in 2021). It\'s fantastic geopolitically.

How consent works in relation to ethics is different for competent vs. incompetent people. Not to mention the various other considerations at play that make this analogy very disanalogous.   Yup, there\'s no problem with this on my view. If I want to get cosmetic surgery, then fine, they can do it. If a surgeon decides he wants to perform a cosmetic surgery on me without my consent, and lethal self-defense was the only way for me to prevent that, that would be fine.   Two things here:  1. Can you substantiate that claim?  2. I\'d leave it up to the woman and her doctor to determine the appropriate medical treatment given the risks.   Yeah, the reason what you\'re saying doesn\'t work is that the right to self-defense against serious bodily injury is fundamental. It can\'t be taken away based on circumstances.  For example, it\'s wrong to make a contract where you will be someone\'s slave, because this would require you to give up a fundamental right you have to liberty. We don\'t let people sell themselves into slavery because it requires giving up a right that they can\'t give up. Same with the right to self-defense against serious bodily injury.   It\'s fundamental in that it can\'t be overridden by another being\'s rights. Of course there are situations where we\'d violate *any and all* rights a being might have. For example, the earth will explode unless we torture, rape, and kill someone.   This is just a confusion on your part, imo. If you\'re the aggressor, you can\'t simultaneously be the victim. I can\'t attempt to kill you and then in the process claim self-defense when you try to defend yourself. It simply wouldn\'t be self-defense.  So yes, killing aggressors is appropriate in some circumstances and aggressors can\'t claim to be victims.   There\'s a difference between minor restrictions on bodily autonomy to avoid birth defects which will harm a future person vs. forcing a woman to serve as an incubator for a (probably) non-sentient fetus while it causes her serious bodily injury.  Bodily autonomy is not a fundamental right. We restrict in in various circumstances, such as prostitution being illegal, some drugs being illegal, sending criminals to jail, etc.  We hardly ever infringe on a person\'s right to defend themselves against serious bodily injury. We only really do this when we\'re torturing or executing criminals. Both of which are evil actions, imo.   We agree that fetuses aren\'t responsible for their actions. Neither are animals (they don\'t know any better). Regardless, if an animal or a fetus is causing someone serious bodily injury, the right to self-defense can be invoked. Self-defense doesn\'t require responsibility on the part of the aggressor. It only requires a sufficient threat to the victim.   Agreed. That\'s why I said that if fetuses were people (which they\'re clearly not), then sex without the intent to procreate should be illegal.  In the real world, fetuses are not people. They\'re also likely not even sentient. And again, if they were, self-defense still applies.  Your argument would have to be that sex is an aggressive action such that a fetus has the right to infringe on a woman\'s body for 9 months and use her as an incubator while causing her serious bodily injury because she committed the heinous crime of having sex. Not to mention, the fetus likely has no (or very minimal) moral value.  And because there\'s so little evidence of fetal sentience, I don\'t think we can say that unprotected sex without the intent to procreate is even immoral.   I think it does. For me, consciousness is what grants moral value, not appearance, or genetics, or ancestry, or any other arbitrary property.   Yes.   No, but you can\'t be inside of someone\'s body without their consent while causing them serious bodily injury. To do that makes you the aggressor and justifies defensive action against you.   Two things: (1) the difference in value between a sentient, self-aware, human person and (2) that the fetus is dependent on the woman and the woman is not dependent on the fetus such that a mutual disconnect between them would heal the woman and kill the fetus.   The fetus isn\'t innocent. It\'s innocent from a moral perspective, but it is not innocent from a harm-causing perspective. You don\'t need to be morally guilty to be guilty of causing harm. Causing harm is sufficient for self-defense to be applied.   Yup, but lethal self-defense is justified in this case because the fetus is causing the woman serious bodily injury and she has no recourse to stop that harm other than terminating pregnancy. Not to mention that the fetus is not sentient and not a self-aware person, unlike the person it is causing SBI.   Fetal sentience becomes possible at 24 weeks. Some scientists believe that the low oxygen atmosphere of the womb precludes fetal sentience until after birth. This is debatable, though.   There\'s primary consciousness, or sentience, or minimal consciousness. This is the basic ability to have a subjective experience. Then there is secondary consciousness or self-awareness. This is the ability to take into consideration your own subjective experience and reflect upon it. This gives you a personal narrative and a sense of self. An ""I"" so to speak. This is what grants personhood on my view.   Yes.   You\'re conflating moral innocence with harm-causing innocence. Fetuses are morally innocent but they are causing harm. Even if someone is morally innocent, lethal self-defense can be justified is sufficient harm is being caused. Fetuses meet that criteria.']"

And yes, I have been told that this is a bad example, but nobody has bothered to explain WHY it is a bad example. I think it is a great example. Very similar to how cold GHGs can heat up the warmer surface.  The GHGs are ""powered"" from the IR they absorb. And a microwave oven is powered from the grid. And both can, because of this, despite being cold, heat up a warmer object using radiation alone. And neither violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics.   If you think this is not true, tell me how a microwave oven manage, despite never getting warm, to pop popcorn!   A cold object CAN heat up a warmer object. But you need to power the process.', ""Sure, what you say is correct for thermal radiation. Radiation spontaneously emitted when heating something up or simply by something having a temperature above 0K.  You say I am incorrect but then make a lengthy explanation that seemingly only shows how you don't disagree with me.  If we talk about heat/energy transfer due to thermal radiation, then the net energy/heat transfer is indeed from hot to cold. I agree.   But I am not talking about heat/energy transfer due to thermal radiation.   I am talking about energy transfer due to non-thermal radiation. Then the net energy transfer can be from a cold object to a warm object.   So, how do you think I am incorrect?"", 'Yes, there actually is ""a plug and socket"" of sorts in the atmosphere.   The power needed to overcome the 2nd law of thermodynamics is supplied to the GHG molecules from absorbed IR.   So you see there IS some other change. IR absorbtion. And the cold GHGs can warm up the warmer surface.  Just like the cold microwave oven can pop popcorn. All without violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics.   So the argument that the cold GHGs can\'t warm the surface, because it would violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, is wrong.  Under certain circumstances a cold body CAN heat up a warmer body.  ""Imagine two objects A and B at the same temperature facing each other, they are in equilibrium. In a vaccum with no defined temperature. Now, what will happen if B is colder than A?""   They are at the same temperature, so B is not colder than A. If B is colder than A, then the two objects are not in thermal equilibrium.   A lot of things may happen. It depends on exactly what the objects are and how they can interact via radiation.   If B is a GHG molecule that just absorbed an IR photon from A, it might re-radiate it towards A. Causing A to heat up slightly.   If B is a LED flashlight, with batteries, and is turned on and directed towards A, then the colder B will heat up the warmer A.']"

It\'s as if they have reasoned, a priori, that I must be wrong and therefore no evidence is needed to prove it.

He creates a fictionalized version of monarchy by looking only at a narrow portion of history and saying ""the good things that happened in this era of history are because of monarchy, and the bad things that happened are the result of democracy.""   I mean sure, anyone can make a compelling argument for anything as long as they include only favorable evidence and ignore all the contrary evidence.    What does it say about a thought experiment that basically *none* of Hoppe\'s reasoning is borne out in practice? He has all these elaborate and logical chain of reasoning to explain why ""private governance"" under a monarch would lead to better outcomes than ""public governance"" under democracy, and yet *real world evidence doesn\'t support his theorizing.*  For example, he claims that monarchs would have high time preference and therefore a strong incentive to increase the productivity of their subjects; in the real world, there is no evidence of this occurring. In fact, monarchies tended to be the strongest proponents of mercantilism and tightly controlled domestic markets. Modern capitalism wasn\'t invented in a European monarchy, it was invented in the Dutch Republic in the 1600s, and the first country to adopt capitalism outside of the Netherlands was England at a time when the monarchy was historically weak (post Glorious Revolution in 1688) and well on its way to being nothing more than a symbolic figurehead.   Or what, might I ask, would Hoppe make of the Belgian Congo? The King of Belgium claimed Congo as his own personal, ""private property"". Is this not the ""private government"" under a monarch which Hoppe says is preferable to democracy? Why then were conditions in the Belgian Congo so much worse under the King of Belgium than in colonies controlled by democratic countries like France and the UK? (not to say things were all sunshine and rainbows in, say, Kenya or French West Africa, but they weren\'t even close to as terrible as what happened in the Belgian Congo)   And almost all of those alliances and treaties were made by monarchies. WWI started when the Serbian Monarchy, with the backing of the Russian Monarchy, murdered the heir to throne of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, which then chose to launch a war because they had the backing of the German Monarchy, and the German monarchy in turn expanded the war when they chose to invade France (a democratic country) despite the French government having basically no involvement in the July Crisis which immediately preceded the outbreak of war. This German invasion of France and Belgium in turn triggered British involvement---the only democratic country to voluntarily join WWI in 1914.   So which democratic country am I forgetting, specifically? At the very least, WWI shows that monarchies are just as susceptible to bad foreign policy (entangling treaties and alliances) as democracies; at worst, the fact that the outbreak of WWI was caused by monarchies is a damning indictment of monarchy. And Hoppe completely ignores this obvious read of the historical evidence. As you say:   So why then is Hoppe trying to pin the blame for WWI on democracy?']"

Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event.""  [https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/dataguide.html](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/dataguide.html)', ""It's not just about false reports though. More people were vaccinated so were more likely to report on VAERS. There was also a huge increase in knowledge of VAERS more people likely to report to it."", 'I get the feeling that it would have saved me so much wasted time typing if you had bothered to follow the link I posted and read a paragraph or two where VAERS contextualizes their data.

Please note: this information is from VAERS. Not MSM or ""Big Pharma"". You seem to say you trust VAERS as a source.  Guide to Interpreting VAERS Data Evaluating VAERS Data Person looking at charts on a hand-held device When evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event.  VAERS Data Limitations Millions of vaccines are given each year to children less than 1 year old in the United States, usually between 2 and 6 months of age. At this age, infants are at greatest risk for certain medical adverse events, including high fevers, seizures, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Some infants will experience these medical events shortly after a vaccination by coincidence.  These coincidences make it difficult to know whether a particular adverse event resulted from a medical condition or from a vaccination. Therefore, vaccine providers are encouraged to report all adverse events following vaccination, whether or not they believe the vaccination was the cause.  When reviewing data from VAERS, please keep in mind the following limitations: VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning that reports about adverse events are not automatically collected, but require a report to be filed to VAERS. VAERS reports can be submitted voluntarily by anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, or family members. Reports vary in quality and completeness. They often lack details and sometimes can have information that contains errors.  ""Underreporting"" is one of the main limitations of passive surveillance systems, including VAERS. The term, underreporting refers to the fact that VAERS receives reports for only a small fraction of actual adverse events. The degree of underreporting varies widely. As an example, a great many of the millions of vaccinations administered each year by injection cause soreness, but relatively few of these episodes lead to a VAERS report. Physicians and patients understand that minor side effects of vaccinations often include this kind of discomfort, as well as low fevers. On the other hand, more serious and unexpected medical events are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes.  A report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described. It only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after vaccine was given. No proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for VAERS to accept the report. VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine.']"

In all current forms AI is little more than that, despite doing it exceptionally well.   The quantum leap to breach this gap between tool and enslaved being requires far more than self awareness. Functions which drive humans toward progressive development may be informed and interpreted through self awareness, but are not inextricably related.   Instincts of self preservation, self development, desire for improved quality of life, happiness, pain, hunger etc stem from hard coded biological conditions that prelude self awareness. These may be understood as logical scientific processes by AI to a degree infinitely greater than our own understanding, but they cannot be experienced by nor influence the developmental trajectory of these purely logical constructs.  One could even argue that complete self awareness might itself safeguard against the accidental formation of true self determination. A system capable of developing the conditions for independent desire, which also has enough self awareness to realise and act on said desires must also be capable of removing the conditions.  Why would a logical system continue to want if it could understand the entire mechanism of its own desire, and freely remove the mechanism without effort?   What's much more terrifying is the prospect of AI being deliberately installed with these mechanisms in the absence of self awareness. A system driven by desires unknown and undiscoverable to itself.

Keep the exact same amounts of all gases. Instead all you change is the albedo of Earth, say from 0.30 to 0.40. Have Earth reflect more sunlight back into space.

No evaporation, condensation or freezing of water, for example.   But when you change the albedo or the radiative forcing of the atmosphere, you change variables not part of the IGL. So you can't use the IGL to predict what effect the changes will have.  I think the IGL works fine! But only for things like pressure, volume, amount of molecules and temperature. PV=nRT. There is no variable for changes in albedo or radiative forcings there.  And you also claim that the saturation argument is correct.

It is just a relative approximation. You think the radiative forcing of CO2 is so extremely large that it can't be any larger! Right? That is what saturated means in this context. Maximally large.  Now you seem to introduce a third variable? Albedo!  If the IGL alone is sufficient to describe how the temperature of Earth change, then there can be no change in albedo as a consequence. Because that would also infuence the temperature. As an amplifying feedback. And the prediction using the IGL alone would not be correct.  If you think changes in albedo can have ANY effect on climate, then you say that the IGL alone is not useful for prediciting how the climate and temperature may change. There is no variable for albedo in the IGL.  In other words you have just shown another way that using the IGL alone is not useful when it comes to predicting climate change."", 'You misread.

The IGL calcs seems to prove that added CO2 does not cause warming. And that there is nothing that is saturated.   If you insist that there is saturation, and the IGL is not able to show that, then the results you get from using (only) the IGL are not valid. The IGL does not take into account the changes in radiative forcing effect from changing levels of CO2.  Maybe - just maybe you are wrong. And then there is no magic at all needed.']"

All these gifted programs separate the kids into ‚Äúwinners‚Äù and ‚Äúlosers‚Äù. It becomes something of a social stumbling block for the ‚Äúnon-gifted‚Äù kids.

A kid who was really motivated and good at math would be in a class with similar kids, same English, and so on. Thing is, this grouping was mostly invisible to the kids. So the kids could be kids and learn to play together. I think the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù model is probably better for everyone. Because, in reality, being ‚Äúgifted‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean much without personal self-discipline and external resources from parents or other groups. We all need to date, find friends, etc. and the best people may not be academic high achievers.  In this day and age a self motivated kid can learn just about anything on the internet.

Meshkov (for whom 72.9% of Crimean voters voted) had a conflict with the speaker of the Crimean parliament, Sergei Tsekov. And it was the parliament that wanted to transform the Republic of Crimea into a parliamentary republic (i.e., according to your terminology, to make a state coup). It was precisely these disagreements that the experienced communist bureaucracy Kuchma took advantage of, illegally depriving the Republic of Crimea of its sovereignty and ordering the abduction of the President of Crimea.   And what does it mean **returned** to Russia? Meshkov was born in Ukraine and has lived in Crimea since childhood.  &amp;#x200B;   I can be somewhat prim and demanding. But when extremists beat up the ""wrong"" presidential candidate of Ukraine on the streets of Kiev, and ""activists"" interfere in the activities of state structures and persecute dissidents all over Ukraine. I do not believe that democratic and fair elections can be held in such conditions.  And that international organizations often behave like hypocritical bastards, it has long been known.  This is one time.  And two. Modern Ukraine is not the USA, it is governed not only by the president. Equally important are the oligarchs, the US Embassy and gangs of far-right extremists. Which of them was chosen by the Ukrainian people?  &amp;#x200B;   Could you elaborate on this issue in more detail? What exactly are you denying? The event itself? But Joe Biden himself boasted in some interior how he removed the Ukrainian Prosecutor General within an hour.   Or do you think that this proves the sovereignty of Ukraine?', 'The other person was asking you about polls in the Donbas region, and you bring up results from the Crimea, which is, as you must know, a different region.  Per your source, people in the Donbas, *not Crimea*, do not actually want to be Russian.', ' well, I support russia\'s annexation of crimea anyhow, it was the democratic thing to do given that it\'s pretty obvious crimeans had wanted to be in russia for a while.  &amp;#x200B;   ehhhh, opinion survey at the time showed that the public, even in donetsk and luhansk, at the time was generally against separatism and to a lesser degree decentralization, and didn\'t really feel that the issue of russian language was that big. Separatist sentiment was unquestionably a minoritarian position in the region at the time. Now, were there guys who genuienly wanted to leave? yeah, I think it\'d be silly to say otherwise, but they were a clearly minoritarian group, and the fact that the russian state had to go to such extreme ends to prop them up and create them (including outright hiring mercenaries for them) indicates that their support was limited, and their democratic mandate in donetsk/luhansk even more so.  &amp;#x200B;   yeah I mean it was clearly a minoritarian position at the time. Crimea was one thing, where there was well established public support for separatism for years, donetsk and luhansk didn\'t have anywhere near that degree of support (and the other oblasts in the south and east, where Russia was likely involved in coordinating separatist movements, even less).  &amp;#x200B;   right, they interfered in their internal affairs, I don\'t think it\'s hard to figure out how ukraine would respond  &amp;#x200B;   1. the crimea dispute already achieved this (and obama himself already disavowed ukrainian memberhsip in NATO) 2. ukraine was already bound by the Yanukovych era neutrality laws under the maidan government, and [the maidan government explicitly committed to them after crimea was annexed](https://web.archive.org/web/20220617181259/https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/198372.html). I have to say, if I wanted to ""keep NATO out"" I probably wouldn\'t want to do the one thing that could piss Ukraine off enough that public opinion would swing from generally anti-NATO to overwhelmingly pro NATO.  &amp;#x200B;   Russia already had this. Had they just not taken over Donbas, the Ukrainian government would have stuck to the yanukovych neutrality laws and not reversed itself on NATO membership (the official reversal of position was specifically over the fact that Russian soldiers would not leave Donbas). They had committed to neutrality, even after Crimea was taken (which bound them to neutrality anyhow). AT some point you have to ask yourself ""how will this country react if I keep destabilizing them and taking hteir land?"" and jeez I don\'t think it\'s hard to figure out. You\'re tryign to create this narrative that Ukraine came out of the maidan swinging for NATO membership and it\'s just wrong, they knew that was a risk, and pursued it only after they realized that offering neutrality clearly wasn\'t good enough.  &amp;#x200B;   [You can check the arms transfers sent to Ukraine prior to the invasion here](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html) (click on the link titled ""register""). There\'s this myth that the west turned the ukrainian military into a fleet of gundams and the truth is that the arms they got were small change, a lot of it second hand and until Trump America refused to even send lethal aid, even though it was clearly only going to be used against the separatists, and not at russia proper (again, Russia claimed no relation to the separatists, they can\'t say they had no relation to them and then treat the separatists as russians proper when they get attacked).  &amp;#x200B;  The truth is that Russia made this problem. they could have simply let things go past crimea and none of this would be an issue. even if they felt like creating the separatists and using htem as a proxy against ukraine (which they did, whether you like to admit it or not), the imperative towards peace was to solve it quickly: trade donbas off for recognition of crimea and reestablish friendly relations. The Russian state knew what it was doing here, they knew that setting up a separatist revolt would create tension in Ukraine, that it would empower the craziest and most sadistic portions of Ukrainian society, that setting up the Minsk charade to be impossible to implement and to only make it implementable if the Ukrainian state accepted a total surrender of its sovereignty (via reintegration of the donbas republics with a total check on all foreign and domestic policy and no oversight on elections), that they were putting the lives of ethnic russians and russophones on the line in Donbas by taking it from Ukraine, that having the abusive and parasitic relationship it had with Ukraine for decades was going to inevitably lead it to turn on it, that Ukraine would have no choice but to go to NATO if Russia wouldn\'t pursue good faith negotiation or accept any compromise or even offer a clear path on how to implement Minsk. They refused to do anything about it and rather than accept that they can only complain and blame the west. Their policy is ""escalate to deescalate"" right? Well, they escalated, and then... escalated further and further and further forcing Ukraine to make its deal with the devil with NATO. Had he simply deescalated, we wouldn\'t be here, but he chose not to, and now his people are suffering for it, and many more.  &amp;#x200B;  Have you listened to Putin\'s speeches where he rails against the west?

In an amazing coincidence - Chuck Grassley\'s top advisor is Barbara Ledeen. Barbara Ledeen just so happens to be very close friends with... Ginni Thomas! And also Mike Flynn! (^**Bonus** ^**fact**! ^- ^Barbara ^Ledeen\'s ^husband ^was ^Mike ^Flynn\'s ^co-author!)  So Eastman\'s plan required a fallback, and Ginni Thomas (probably) helped orchestrate the Chuck Grassley part. That part being - Chuck Grassley being on board with doing the shit Pence refused to do. Her and Ledeen were why Grassley was totally on board.   Ok so dig this as evidence - on January 5th - **Chuck Grassley accidentally told reporters the plan**. He said that Pence wasn\'t supposed to be there and that he\'d be presiding. Reporters were like wtf old guy talkin bout?   Grassley walked it back a short while later, and everyone sorta forgot about it - as old senator misspoke - nothing bother remembering.   So it\'s worth investigating Ginni Thomas, and probably Chuck Grassley and Barbara Ledeen as well.   This all sounds like a shitty netflix series, but it really happened.   *oh, and I know that deep down in the bowls of whatever inner chamber Trump and his sycophants planned this shit - the personal safety of Mike Pence was not a top priority.']"

1743	17	1743_manosphere_sections_dating_men	['manosphere', 'sections', 'dating', 'men', 'pillers', 'women', 'courtship', 'sex', 'relationships', 'hookups']	"[' Indeed, this is pure fantasy.   This is a cultural script, ""Women want love, men want sex."" But in reality both things are deeply intertwined for both genders. Women do many times reject relationships with men who love them and have a good personality simply because they don\'t like the sex with them, and men do many times reject sex with women they find attractive simply because they don\'t like their personality (""don\'t stick your dick in crazy"").  Overall, the problem with dating is just that both genders have it difficult to get what they want. Men and women want most of the time relationships, and both have it difficult to find people they find attractive and like their personality (men do have standards, it\'s a myth that they would take anyone). Sometimes men and women want hookups, and both have it difficult to find hookups: Men have it difficult to find hookup partners at all, and women have it difficult to find hookup partners who they deem safe and caring for her pleasure (orgasm gap). So it\'s much more nuanced than ""The top 20% men are taking all the women.""', 'What do you think ""game"", ""gaming the system"", etc means? I was responding to the previous comment about improving your game.  If you are a woman, you have no idea of the struggles men go through in getting their sexual needs met. Women don\'t have to do anything except consent, to have sex, because there is a queue of men waiting for an opportunity. Men have to pursue and encourage women to consent to have sex: it\'s not simply men choosing to have sex and an eager line of women just waiting. The situation represents a non-level playing field. As a consequence, to improve their chances of sex, men must have strategy to counter womens extreme selectivity and apparent reluctance to have sex. It is a battle for men to have sex with women when its all about attractiveness which many men don\'t possess, yet they still have this biological sexual drive to satisfy.  How would women respond if having a baby depended on them pursuing men, encouraging them to consent (with criminal penalties for coercion or ignoring consent) and being attractive, with men being highly selective unless the women tick all the right boxes; and men still being able to say no for whatever reason, including because the woman upset them about something else, or something else in the mans life upset them, or they want the woman to do something for them they are reluctant to do, so they hold out the reward of a baby if they do everything they want? That\'s the nearest equivalent analogy to the situation for men and sex.  If sex was a game and women the gaming casino operators, the casino would be completely rigged in the casinos favour and men would have to count cards, etc to win.', 'I disagree. I think there are sections of it worth looking into chiefly because they can help a man untangle what precisely it is they want out of a relationship and what they expect.  I agree the dating sections are shit, but the parts about misandry from other sections of what is arbitrarily grouped together as ""The manosphere"" and gender roles are worth considering. You might find that you\'re not actually all that interested in a relationship but feel like you\'re supposed to have one, or you might find that there\'s a particular type of woman you\'re interested in meeting and so on. ""What do you want?"" ""A girlfriend."" ""Why."".   The ""Why"" is basically never discussed outside the manosphere because it\'s assumed by almost the entirety of society that it\'s self-evident that a man should want a girlfriend and the value of women is beyond question, or assumed that the man just wants sex.   But the truth is most people aren\'t worth dating, and that includes most women. If you can\'t come up with a reason for ""Why"" then the ""Dating advice"" much of the manosphere would give you is; ""Don\'t bother mate. It\'s not worth your time. Here\'s some readings on how we\'re pressured into dating for its own sake"". If your ""Why"" is sex, they\'ll say ""You don\'t need a girlfriend for that, but maybe find someone who feels similarly. Don\'t pretend it\'s about much more than that. Find a woman who is content with that arrangement and be open about what you\'re seeking."" and so on and so on. ""Company"" ""because I want kids"", all down the line, the different reasons mean your approach should vary drastically. You\'re talking about red pillers, who while part of the manosphere, aren\'t even the largest part of it, let alone the sole part of it.  There\'s also stuff about red flags to avoid and so on. Which brings me to my opinion on male dating advice; if it isn\'t including discernment, self-awareness of what you want, confidence in asserting what you want and dismissing people who lash out at you for having a particular goal in mind, and self-protection, it\'s bad. Learning how to identify which women will be a waste of your time or make you miserable being with them is important, and pretty much only the manosphere discusses that on behalf of men.  The ""How to get a woman"" sections are crap. But not all sections are interested in discussing that. Frankly the good sections of the manosphere seem to reductively insist that you just be up front about what you specifically want and look for women who want the same, and that\'s the extent of their ""How to get it"" advice. A significant amount of them discuss ways men can protect themselves, their wellbeing, and invest less of their self-esteem into the project, as well as discussing what precisely it is that men get from relationships and whether the men in question actually want that and so on.  They\'re nontheless painted with the same brush because of a generally critical attitude to women, and for having the temerity to propose that most women are a burden to date and/or overall a negative experience for men. But that\'s genuinely a very useful thing to have in mind if you\'re trying to date. it will save you a world of trouble once you realize most women are kind of shit and invest zero energy in pursuing them unless they actually meet your actual standards and have an aligned set of desires and goals out of a relationship.  TL;DR.  Don\'t go to red pill spaces. Go to places like leftwingmaleadvocates, or mensrights. Menslib i\'d also tentatively say covers some of this, but not all of it.  People can disagree all they want, but surveys suggest that MRAs are coupled at levels higher than the rest of the population, and male feminists are coupled less than the rest of the population. I haven\'t seen data on red pillers, but I do suspect they\'re somewhat lower than male feminists. So evidently MRAs are on to something.']"

On the server side, which is where all the real money in IT is made, Linux absolutely dominates (usually on somebody else's computer \\*cough\\* sorry, I mean the cloud). Windows exists, but it ever-dwindles. Even in the olden days, Netware and UNIX variants competed handily with windows for server-side stuff; certainly unix variants were being used for this purpose before MS-DOS even existed.  On the desktop side, you are right that Windows is dominant (modern Windows isn't actually related to MS-DOS in any way, that lineage ended with Windows ME). However, if IBM had licensed CP/M, that OS would probably have filled the same role. Or OS/9 from the Macintosh, or AmigaOS, or some UNIX variant (unlikely)... or maybe there would have been no dominant business OS.  It's so difficult to speculate about what that world would have looked like exactly...Microsoft was so dominant that they had an effect on how everything developed. However, I don't believe that the Digital Research driven universe would have been fundamentally different in character from the Microsoft driven one. There just would have been different logos on the boxes."", 'That comparison is not fair for a few reasons. For one, Microsoft is involved in a huge number different industries, whereas...I don\'t even know what the number for Linux means. Presumably it\'s of all sales of paid Linux-based products?

So basically there is nothing comparable in those numbers. They represent different things.  As far as desktop, Windows is still dominant in desktop yes, but Apple is no slouch and is actually a larger company (in fact, *the largest company in the world*).  But none of this is the point, because what I\'m arguing against is the claim that Bill Gates was responsible for the IT revolution. He was in no way responsible for it; it was already happening when MS-DOS came on the scene, and it would have carried on perfectly well without him.  In the ""DR-DOS"" universe, you are still using a web browser to talk to people halfway around the world on a chat website, and I can still do my job from my bedroom. Here are some much stronger candidates to consider:  * Douglas Englebart - Mother of all Demos * Ken Thompson/Dennis Ritchie - UNIX * Jim Clark - Silicon Graphics * Gordon Moore/Robert Noyce - Intel * Bill Joy - Sun Microsystems * Tim Berners-Lee - the World Wide Web * Rod Canion/Jim Harris/Bill Murto - Compaq, the first IBM PC clone company * Grace Hopper - High-level programming languages * Margaret Hamilton - Software engineering as a discipline  And countless other people I\'m forgetting who standardized things like networking protocols, busses, and other interfaces or applications that made the world go round smoothly and efficiently. If anything, the primary job of Microsoft was to make things more proprietary and less open, which is often a hinderance.

If lower communism is the transitional phase, and the transitional phase is the DotP, it follows that the lower phase is the DotP.', ' You are making the logical leap here, not Marx. Show me where Marx says that the lower stage of communism is the complete end of the capitalist mode of production and a complete end of the state. Show me further what Marx calls the phase before the lower phase of communism. I cannot find any writing to this effect. What I do find is Marx\'s explanation that the lower phase of communism is the phase after the revolution removes the bourgeoisie from power and also that removing the bourgeoisie from power creates the DotP, leading any reasonable interpretation of Marx\'s theoretical timeline toward communism as an event (revolution) that produces phase 1 (lower phase) that subsequently produces phase 2 (higher phase).   Yes. Section 3 in particular goes into the critique that you seem to be confused about. Marx is not arguing that ""a state"" is the problem, but rather that the Gotha Programme literally was seeking concession from ""the state"", that is, the bourgeois state, to build proletarian socialism within a bourgeois state, an impossible task.  Section 4 shows us what the alternative is (and it\'s not immediate statelessness)   Marx criticizes reformists who believe they can liberalize the state enough to allow socialism to flourish inside it. He explicitly states here that the alternative is literally subordinating the state, not destroying it but rather revolutionizing it.    Literally spelling it out for us right here. Marx refuses to answer specific questions in the abstract because it must be arrived at through empirical struggle. Nevertheless, the DotP is the period of transformation between capitalism and communism and it is characterized not merely by its economics but also it politics in which the state exists and is dominated by the working class.   I know.   No. The lower phase of communism is literally the society that is born from the revolution and the establishment of the DotP, such a society ""emerges from capitalist society, which is thus in every respect, economically, morally and intellectually, still stamped with the birth-marks of the old society"". There is no theoretical phase between capitalism and lower communism. Lower communism IS the transitional phase.   Where? I don\'t see this in the text.   I think this is a deliberate misreading of them. Note that neither Lenin nor Stalin refer to the third stage in your selected quotations. Socialism and Communism as terms are still being used interchangeably here. Nowhere will you find anyone claiming that labor vouchers are a prerequisite for the lower stage of communism, and equally nowhere will you find anyone that has any theory for how labor vouchers can be managed and distributed without a state.  You seem to be inventing a third phase where none exists for the express purpose of committing the No True Scotsman fallacy. Marx did not create prescriptions nearly as precise as you are putting forth. The lower phase of communism has always been the end of the bourgeois state, the repression of reactionary forces, the implementation of planning to replace the duality of private property and profit as the governing forces allocating labor, and the distribution of socially necessary goods and services to the members of society through that planning process instead of for profit. And what do we see in every revolutionary project since the Soviet project? The abolition of private property, the disenfranchisement of the bourgeoisie, the allocation of labor to that which is socially necessary both for maintenance of the proletariat and the advancement of society beyond scarcity, the free allocation of socially necessary goods and services (food, medicine, education, healthcare, etc) without the governing forces of profit driving social distribution, the raising up of the poorest of society far and away beyond anything capitalism has ever done, and the vigilance (and in the case of the USSR and Yugoslavia, failure thereof) to prevent (local and global) reactionary forces from revising the program and redirecting it towards the establishment of bourgeois power and maintenance.  Your insistence on your definitions leads you to the conclusions that a) the last 100 years of revolutionary work has amounted literally to nothing but the continuance of capitalism, b) that the lower phase of communism can never occur until all global reactionary forces have been neutralized and made impotent, and c) all currently existing revolutionary projects are not in fact socialist projects but are capitalist projects with socialist aesthetics and ambitions.  None of these conclusions are useful. They are definitional cul-de-sacs that attempt to preserve some form of perceived linguistic purity that is a stand-in for theoretical purity when literally the entirety of the actual cadre of practitioners have developed their understanding through actual empirical observation and analytical reconciliation and refinement. In the worst case, they lead one to work against actual anti-capitalist projects that are building socialism and create the conditions for barbarism justified by artificial theoretical purity, like Hoxha, like ultra-leftists, or like Trotsky.', 'If lower communism is the transitional phase, and the transitional phase is the DoTP, it follows that the lower phase is the DoTP  I don\'t think this is a correct conclusion that follows your point. Society goes through different stages. There is capitalism, and then, a revolution. After the revolution, we cannot immediately abolish commodity production, the exchange system etc and thus we need a semi-state (the DoTP) to lead us to lower phase communism. Once we reach lower phase communism, or socialism, there will no longer be a state, the exchange of commodities, or class, but we are not yet fully in communism. So yes, socialism is a transition phase as it will lead to full communism, but it is not the transition between capitalism and itself.   None of the quotes you sent prove what you are claiming, and nowhere did Marx say that lower phase communism is the DoTP. Here is what Marx says about the lower phase (socialism):  developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it    emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect,    economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the    birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly,    the individual producer receives back from society ‚Äì after the    deductions have been made ‚Äì exactly what he gives to it. What he has    given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social    working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the    individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the    social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a    certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount    of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this    certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as    much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he    has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.  As we can see, it is still ""stamped"" with the birthmarks of old society, we cannot yet operate under the ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"" - labour has not yet been fully emancipated and thus the existence of labour certificates, or vouchers must exist. Despite this, there is no state, and no classes. Even Stalin, someone I regard as being a revisionist, was able to admit that classes and the state cannot exist under socialism, and that the transition period between capitalism and lower phase communism is the DotP.  If your claim is that Marx said or believed X, please supply quotes from Marx, not someone\'s *interpretation* of Marx. After all, if you are correct in claiming that Marx said that socialism and the DotP are the same thing, you should have no problem finding evidence from Marx or Engels to support your point.']"

That‚Äôs the main issue, Ticketmaster has a legal monopoly and even the biggest artists in the world who have a ton of pull can‚Äôt do anything about it which is evident by the fact that some have tried and failed.', ' No. But this thread is about Swift. Could say same about Springsteen, Metallica or any other current top act. They profit tremendously from the monopoly.    Ticketmaster itself makes a pittance on these tours compared to the artists. Swift could play any venue - she doesn\'t need MSG. She could literally play on a landingstrip of an airport and sell out. But the deal with Ticketmaster brings her +$500M from tickets alone and she gets all of it since she has forbidden secondary sales. And that\'s not counting the merch. Ticketmaster is estimated to make $15-20M in comparison. Swift is not at Ticketmaster\'s mercy - the artists and labels just use the monopoly as a convenient money making machine, in which they themselves get the profit.  The Pearl Jam case everyone always keeps brings up is from -95. Let\'s just drop it. It\'s not relevant today.    Edit: Just to clarify. The choice of using ""dynamic pricing"" is up to the artists. They choose this because they want to reap the profits that would otherwise go to secondary sellers. That\'s the part that boosts their bottom line. They can do this because they choose to play on Ticketmaster exclusive venues which forces buyers into the ""dynamic pricing"" tickets.  The artists who choose this profit tremendously from Ticketmaster monopoly.      No one in this system is your friend or on your side. It\'s ice cold capitalism maximizing every possible profit.']"

That's the same as #1, but it just doesn't happen at a coordinated point like #1.  So, no, it does not slow traffic down as much as #3.  Sure, in #2, some cars try to open up to allow the merge too quickly, causing traffic to slow more than #1.  We're agreeing that #1 is ideal.  But #3 is far worse for traffic speed through the chokepoint than #2."", 'If you are trying to compare #2 and #3, you cant just assume that in #2 magically everyone preforms a proper zipper, just early, that makes no sence and is not how it happens IRL.   When people merge early, it is, by definition, unpredictable because it is not the proper way to do it, and often against local driving law. The proper way most people are taught is to zipper, meaning move to the end of the merge lane then alternate into traffic.   In #2, the traffic lane must, be definition, not be letting people in from the merge lane, otherwise most cars would simply drive to the end of the merge lane and then merge which is the predictable right thing to do. If they are being forced to merge early, that is because the traffic lane is not leaving enough space so people have to cram in where they can. This causes cars to stop, crating backups.  if cars are cramming in half a mile early, or cramming in at the end of the merge lane, the effect and traffic flow is the same. The only way to reduce unpredictability and stoppage is a proper zipper, and a proper zipper is at the end of the merge lane, which is the expected zipper location, anything outside of that will be short lived and chaotic, or otherwise just be people cutting each other off.  There are countless studies that back up my assertation.  https://www.virginiadot.org/vtrc/main/online_reports/pdf/05-r6.pdf  PROPOSED GUIDELINES FOR APPLICATION  Even though the results of the field tests and the simulations were not directly comparable, they seem to suggest that the percentage of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream plays an important role in the efficacy of the late merge. As a result, the proposed guidelines for application of the late merge focus on the percentage of heavy vehicles.  ‚Ä¢ Two-to-one configuration. The late merge should be considered for 2-to-1 lane closure configurations to improve throughput when large numbers of heavy vehicles are present (&gt;20 percent) for the majority of the time and congestion and queuing are often present.  ‚Ä¢ Three-to-one configuration. While the simulation results showed that the late merge significantly improved throughput for all situations, there are no documented evaluations of the deployment of the late merge in this configuration. Further research is needed to determine how the late merge could be deployed in this type of configuration to ensure driver understanding of the signs.', ""let's say hypothetically, in #2, that the lane getting merged into temporarily stops for a merge half a mile before the chokepoint.  this is the worst case scenario for #2 (just assuming the chokepoint is the problem, not other backups).  The cars in the merge lane now have half a mile to speed up and close any gaps between cars.  Now consider that same scenario with #3.  The slowdown and opening up of gaps is right before the chokepoint.  This, unquestionably, slows down throughput through the chokepoint more.  In #2, drivers also tend to have a lot of time to prepare for the merge.  in #3, it is impossible to know where the cars passing will end up in line, so there can't be you lose that preparation.  That means the merge is likely to be worse.  Matching speed makes merges easier.  Think about the speed of the car in #3.  They often are either driving much faster than the lane getting merged into, or run out of road and have to stop.  In #2, cars in the merging lane match the speed of the lane they merge into.  This makes merges smoother.   there is a simple solution that gets #2 pretty close to #1.  cars that want to merge match the speed of the cars in the lane to get merged into.  If you want to encourage a zipper merge and you are in the lane getting merged into, open up the gap as slowly as you can for the car to merge.  opening up the gap slowly delays the merge, getting everything closer to #1.  If you're the one merging, match traffic flow.  if a gap opens up, too early, the damage is already done, merge in.  Its better than that gap closing then opening again.  And still much better than stopping traffic at the merge point.""]"

The Center for Disease Control in the US has a long history of anti-gun advocacy - to the point that Congress made a law prohibiting them from studying gun homicides for the purpose of advocating for gun control.  The CDC Director at the time was such an anti-gun crusader that he ignored the law and was removed from office over it.  They did a study several years ago on defensive gun use in the US - and promptly hid the results because they discovered that there were 2.5 million defensive gun uses per year in the US.  That's where a criminal is in the process of committing a crime, and a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to stop them.  Recently, there was a Freedom Of Information Act request that forced that study public - and it happened to jibe nicely with a private study that had been done around the same time.  So activists just got the CDC to remove their study from public view, because it was making it harder to push for gun control.   They also have less than 1/10 the population of the US.

This whole narrative of ""Judges aren\'t historians"" always struck me as disingenuous. A core part of any judge\'s job is reviewing legal history (precedent) for the validity of a party\'s motion. Reviewing the records of laws and their historical application is a basic skill for a jurist.     Unlike the interpretations that preceded it, Originalism directes a fixed interpretation. It does this by requiring any interpretation be based on the black letter of legally binding text with the definitions of the words at the time using the original public meaning or less commonly the documented intent of authors at the time of their passing.    It solves the problem of Supreme Court justices ignoring the Article V amendment process and modifying the legal meaning of the Constitution at will with neither the consent or input of the legislature, states, or people. Living Constitutionalism is a cancer because it let\'s government expand it\'s own scope and power at will and is explicitly judicial activism because it is modifying law just because a justice think\'s it\'s the right thing to do or that government should have an interest in it.  It has also been around since before Roe. The Federalist Society was formed in response to Roe, which might have you mixed up. Roe was such a horrendously authored case with basically no constitutional basis to the point even RBG admitted it wouldn\'t wold up to scrutiny. Such an egregious act of judicial activism to bend the constitution simply to advance a controversial policy aim caused a raucous among parts of the legal profession. Thus the FS was formed to promote Originalism and Textualism within the profession to maintain a constitutional limited government and primarily do this by hosting debates and discussions.', 'Originalism is not: the first court to rule on the issue is right.

The purpose of two thirty is to allow ""any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise"" without a platform also becoming liable for their other content.  Before then,  [https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/4540](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/4540)  [https://archive.epic.org/free\\_speech/cubby\\_v\\_compuserve.html](https://archive.epic.org/free_speech/cubby_v_compuserve.html)  Those two decisions set the precedent that if you moderated your content at all, including ""objectionable content,"" then you are now liable the same way a publisher is, and you are no longer free the same way an ISP or phone provider is.

The entire purpose of 230 is to allow moderation without also waiving the natural protections a platform would get.  If we removed 230 altogether, and placed law enforcement in the hands of law enforcement, rather than with platforms, then things would already be better than they are. The entire purpose of 230 is already crooked, ""obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise"" is of intentionally broad scope. Just like it\'s disingenuous to suggest the founding father\'s couldn\'t have foreseen ARs, it\'s a lie to suggest that politicians from the 90s couldn\'t foresee Twitter.

Social media at the time wasn't really a thing, this was about 10 years before Facebook brought it mainstream and about 15 years before the advent of the data mining techniques in use today to flag possibly-questionable content for review. At the time, content moderation consisted of manual review and Silicon Valley wasn't nearly as rich or powerful as it is today, so the financial capacity to hire a huge moderation teams was lacking. The prevailing theory at the time was that ably moderating such sites against even illegal content is impossible and that (*e.g.*) DropBox the company shouldn't be held liable should the government find that a few DropBoxes with child porn or pirate bootlegs of the most recent Disney movie escaped its content moderation team's notice. Given this landscape, public opinion in 1996 considered it impossible on a technical level to effectively censor anything other than a very small and limited forum site by viewpoint, and online forums were nerdy stuff that normal people didn't do anyway.  This all changed in the intervening years. Silicon Valley got rich, online forums went mainstream (that is essentially what social media is at brass tacks: a forum site), and new algorithms and data mining techniques were refined and brought into wider use. As a result, the landscape of content moderation and online censorship shifted massively and ¬ß 230 failed to keep pace. Content moderation based on viewpoint therefore thus became common, all while being protected by an outdated and increasingly-overbroad set of legal protections.  This form of corruption is very common where laws written for one era fail to anticipate earthquake levels of technological change.""]"

Whole neighborhoods were razed of the city cityscape, as we are going to talk about later. The city\'s cityscape was deformed, like Mosul is defined by the leaning minaret.

I have stated, many times, this is not an attack on Capitalism as I personally believe that Capitalism is the best socio-economical system the world has seen by a significant margin.  This post was specifically about ASPD traits under Capitalism.

Understand that I am not putting forth a moral statement of agenda and I think it is obvious that too succeed in business you would naturally have to narcissistically put your needs ahead of others - I would do the same. A person with a higher capacity for empathy would be much less likely to be disagreeable and therefore less likely to ask for a raise etc. but people with ASPD would have no problem doing this.

The ""discovery"" was ""discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material.""  Basically, the Noble Prize was not issued for the Photo but for the model Watson and Crick proposed to Sydney Brenner. As Rosaline was deceased at the time (1962) she was ineligible for a posthumous award.  So, Watson and Crick didn\'t ""steal"" the discovery. They built of Rosaline\'s work without crediting her. It\'s bad, and I think Rosaline should have received credits, but not really an example of men taking credit for a woman\'s work.  &amp;#x200B;  At least, that\'s my understanding of it from what I have read.', 'Nobody said nothing about the Nobel Peace Prize award specifically until you brought it up as the arbitrary litmus test for whether or not Rosalind Franklin got the credit she was due.

The original commenter doesn‚Äôt say Watson and Crick stole the model, they say Franklin was central to the discovery and evidence for the double helix structure, which is true. Yet she was not credited. What don‚Äôt you understand about this?', 'There was no ""Nobel Peace Prize"" there was a Nobel Prize in IIRC Medicine and/or Chemistry.   Same as the Guardian really. The oft repeated line that Watson and Crick stole Rosaline\'s discovery is not really true. They failed to properly credit her for the photo, and she nearly beat them in the race to develop a theoretical model, but *they didn\'t steal anything as far as we know*.   They were cavalier, but never paid a third party to steal the image, or whatever weird stuff people accuse them of. Fundamentally, Rosaline got jibbed, but how and to what extent is not obvious and hinges on questions we simply do not know the answer to. Example, the photo. How did Watson and Crick get it?  The account I have read suggests that Wilkins gave it to them after Rosaline had made it public at a 1951 lecture. If this is the case, then no, Watson and Crick didn\'t really do anything malicious as far as I know.  Your own post here is really a distillation of the problem.

Because like I said in my post, race is so nuanced and a broad grouping of people as opposed to ethnicity which is more narrow and specific. The best example being \'black\', because this \'race\' didnt even exist &lt;100 years ago and the people we now consider to be black were either then called Hamites (which were considered then to be a subgroup of caucasians) or (for lack of a better word) ""negroes"". And regardless there is no \'black\' cultural history today, only ethnic ones, ie African-Americans, Nigerians, Caribbean, Ethiopian..    My understanding is that races like \'black\' or \'white\' are just a labels applied to someone who meets a certain phenotype (with political roots as well, explains why Italians immigrants weren\'t initially considered white when they first landed in the U.S.), because theres no genetic or cultural trait that all \'black\' people share with one another.  While I think your argument certainly applies to ethnicity I don\'t see it applying to race because there\'s no \'black\' culture, \'black\' heritage or \'black\' dna like i said but only ethnic ones. Because of my perspective on this, I fail to see what an individual like [martina big](https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/29261384_2064959633781163_5735926568950169600_n.jpg) (left) would be appropriating for identifying as black, shes a german woman identifying herself as black but not appropriating a specific ethnic group or culture, she like I\'m discussing is transracial in the sense of the broad group, since theres no \'black dna\' what objection is there?   [Sandra Laing](https://journeyman-media.s3.amazonaws.com/films/707/images/707_poster_4x3.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJAVLQMJIUYNMDUGQ&amp;Signature=YlBLj1AWYticPO92scH0NyM%2BlfA%3D&amp;Expires=1701357078), grew up during the south african apartheid  born to two white persons, got kicked out of school and faced a life of hardships.

Also, the reasoning that parents know their child will be the same race doesn\'t apply to mixed children.. Obama, Halle Berry, Beyonce, and Zendaya for example are all 50/50 white and black but are considered \'black\', rarely called \'mixed\' and *never*  called white. I think the issue is veryyy nuanced and not concrete like people make it out to be, race is very much more based on how you look like, not parents/dna/culture like ethnicity is.  Some women also feel \'appropriation\' to an extent from transgender women, particularly in the case of women\'s sports, which begs the question: is it any more racist to be transracial than it is sexist to become transgender? Especially seeing that there is a likely biological difference (and advantage) there as opposed to race where there\'s no biological basis. Thanks again also', ""Well since race is for the largest part socially constructed, it's all about identifying. Not just for mixed people. Here are some examples; Middle-Easterners and North-Africans are classified as 'white' in the US and many other American countries, but they aren't white for any social norms. In Europe do they call Moroccans with a light tan skin 'sand n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*'. Christian Arabs in the US mostly 'white pass' while Muslims don't. Spoken about religion to racial identity many Ashkenazi Jews who mostly go through people their window as 'white' don't identify with that term and like other Jews only with their respective diaspora. Just like how many Africans don't identify as 'black' and only as their respective ethnicity. You should also know that a lot of Hispanics and Latino's self identify as 'white' while being mixed race and the mixed race Hispanics and Latino's who actually acknowledge the fact don't identify as both white/indigenous or white/black, etc but only with their respective 'caste' like: 'mestizo', 'mulatto', etc because a caste is much more than a set of ancestries.  But apart from people who identify as a race based on cultural factors and when we look at DNA is the idea of a 'black' race and a 'white' race stupid as fuck. At first there isn't anything such as 'black' or 'white' DNA. Yes, you have DNA that's found in African populations and DNA found in European populations. But Africa and Europe aren't monolith especially Africa. The genetic differences between Bantus and Khoisan are bigger than the differences between Europeans and East-Asians. Also, dark skinned Pygmies are more related light skinned Khoisan than dark skinned Bantus (while people mostly think of Pygmys as just tiny Bantus) and when we talk about 'black Sub-Saharan Africans' as a whole, they are genetically closer to 'white Europeans' than what you would call 'black Melanesians' who are the most genetically distant form Sub-Saharan Africans.""]"

Unfortunately for the guest, ‚Äúthere are just so many reasons this wouldn‚Äôt work,‚Äù Tolman said. For starters ‚Äúthe water for the snow-making comes from a pond.‚Äù  It‚Äôs no fad for the rich to spoil their lovers at high altitude.

Pentek once had an ultrahigh net-worth client staying in a European ski town for a few weeks.

Some want fully staffed mountain mansions, like the $30,000-a-night chalet that the luxury travel company Remote Lands books for clients in Niseko, Japan‚Äôs premier ski resort.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just massive and it has everything you can possibly imagine in it,‚Äù Remote Lands CEO Catherine Heald said.  Other people prefer to book an entire resort. Nadine Paulo of Travel Edge buys out the whole Sheldon Chalet in remote Alaska for clients willing to pay $75,000 for up to four people for a three-night minimum stay.  Of course some people would rather buy a property (or a room) at a resort.  ‚ÄúWe have several billionaires who own here,‚Äù Tolman said of Stein Eriksen, where all rooms are individually owned.  Some skiers stay at their rooms all season; some rent them out part of the time. Tolman knows of one owner who bought the property without seeing it, remodeled it and has still never been.  ‚ÄúJust probably had to park $5 million somewhere,‚Äù he said.

He was fascinated by his clients, two brothers, who bought a pair of three-bedroom condos next to each other despite their penchant for hosting big groups. ‚ÄúYou see friends and family sleeping on the couch of your $12 million condo when you could have had a badass ski house somewhere else, but people pay that for being in there,‚Äù Vullo said.

It could also be used as a place to house people in the event of a disaster or a place to explore the unknown.   The most important reason why we should build a giant cube is that it could be used for scientific research. Scientists could use the cube to conduct experiments in a variety of fields, from space exploration to medical research. With its large surface area, the cube could be used to create different environments and explore the effects of different conditions on various substances. Moreover, the cube could be used to study the effects of gravity on different materials and test theories about the universe.   Additionally, the cube could also be used for entertainment purposes. It could be used as a large theatre or concert hall, providing people with a unique experience. It could also be used for large events like festivals, conferences, and trade shows. The cube could be used to create a unique atmosphere and provide people with a new way to experience the world.    Furthermore, the cube could be used as an emergency shelter. In the event of a disaster, such as an earthquake or hurricane, the cube could provide a safe place for people to stay. It could also be used as a temporary home for those affected by disasters.

Yes, you literally are proven innocent. That\'s how our justice system works. There was never any CREDIBLE REASON to believe you DID THE CRIME. Ergo, you are PROVEN innocent.

How are these two related? Are you accusing the PRC of killing children in Xinjiang\'s schools? I\'m *trying* to be charitable here, but you are not making it easy.   As a rule, we should define what things are and describe them accurately when engaged in a discussion about things. It is mandatory that children attend schools in almost every nation on Earth. These schools are not prisons. Prisons are a different second thing.  You\'re correct that what we call it doesn\'t negate any atrocities committed there, IF THERE WERE ANY ATROCITIES COMMITTED THERE. Yes.    Guantanamo Bay is literally a prison. It\'s a military prison. No one has any confusion about that. When you ask questions like this you should try to flesh them out into actual arguments.   If I had no credible evidence to suspect you committed the crime in the first place--yes. Unequivocally yes. That\'s HOW our justice system works. That\'s how MOST justice systems work. If the person who accused you of the crime is shown to have fabricated the evidence--also yes. Absolutely yes.   Prove to me that a single school in Xinjiang stripped anyone of their religion. There are more Mosques in Xinjiang now than ever, state-sponsored schools teach new generations of Imams. No one has been stripped of Islam in Xinjiang. Radical terrorists‚Äî  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is the reason you brought up human sacrifice among Indigenous Americans and the reason you\'re arguing about extremism and religion that you think that de-radicalizing Salafist jihadists and stopping them from bombing marketplaces full of civilians and cutting people up with machetes in the streets and assassinating Imams and terrorizing women for not wearing the hijab--that you think this constitutes genocide?   You\'re saying that trying to stop extremism infiltrating your community is the same as genocide? That\'s an argument you\'re making? Because yeah, if you defined it that way--sure. No one does, though. And it would be horribly insulting to the actual victims of actual genocides and it would be a stupid, stupid, ridiculous bar that would make every nation on earth constantly guilty of genocide.   Would make the word meaningless.   &lt;.&lt;   No one is stripping anyone of their religion. You persist in arguing from these strong claims as though they were true and have provided nothing approaching evidence to support them.   Whereas above, linked in the OP, is actual evidence Islam is thriving in Xinjiang. You could also google that, look around a bit. See that Islam is not, in any way, being persecuted in Xinjiang. Radical terrorism is.   If my ""religion"" is that I\'m going to bomb you and murder your family, you could CLAIM that holding me and my group of extremists in custody is some kind of genocide. It\'d be fucking stupid, though. That isn\'t a religion. That\'s an extremist, terrorist ideology. If acting against those constitutes a genocide, EVERY STATE ON EARTH is doing genocide.    No, *it isn\'t*. The requirement is **REASONABLE** suspicion. For them to come into your home and tear that motherfucker apart looking for evidence requires **REASONABLE** suspicion. It\'s in the Fourth Amendment, my dude. It\'s what that WHOLE thing is about.    No. That you have *REASONABLE* suspicion that a COURT of your PEERS would find REASONABLE to WARRANT that ACTION. Otherwise it becomes HARASSMENT, literally. Cops in this country are not allowed to run your pockets and rip up your car any time they *suspect* you. Anytime they have *any reason*. They have to have a *reasonable suspicion* that a JURY and JUDGE would find *reasonable*.   Nope.

Never how it has. Except in cases where racism and other bullshit was involved. But it\'s not how the principle works. Not how it works for rich white folks or corporations.   Anywho. I think we\'re about done here.', ' Regarding your reply, you can\'t show proof something has never happened. You can\'t prove a negative, most often--and you don\'t have to. The burden is on your opponent to prove the positive. That something DID happen.  That\'s why people are innocent until proven guilty and not guilty until proven innocent--because proving something didn\'t happen is an unreasonable and nearly impossible standard. Proving there AREN\'T invisible pink unicorns on the moon is not a reasonable ask--the reasonable position is to ask the person who claims there are to prove it.  Debunking the weak ass evidence behind the claims of genocide is enough to completely dismiss the claim as spurious. Beyond that, just looking at Xinjiang today, seeing happy Uyghurs playing with happy Han, and Uyghur books in bookstores and Uyghur cuisine on the streets and Uyghur music in the coffee shops and Ugyhur dance is sufficient. Proof positive. No genocide occurred--if it did it was weak and ineffectual as fuck.  If China wanted to genocide Uyghurs they have the power to do that. The entire story of them pussyfooting around to slowly kind of but kind of not genocide Uyghurs is a fucking joke. The fever dream of sinophobes.  If someone says you broke a vase but the vase is right there whole for the whole world to see, we can all safely say you didn\'t break the vase.   That has less than no bearing. You accuse someone of genocide and then don\'t trust them when they show you video evidence it didn\'t happen? That\'s absurd. Of course we should listen to what China says, even if we don\'t believe it--they\'re the one being accused. That would be like accusing someone of murder and discarding their testimony out of hand (or refusing to even hear it) because they\'re the suspect. We have an obligation to listen to what China says in their defense if we want to take this issue even remotely seriously.    Doesn\'t map. The Spanish *were* engaged in a cultural genocide. As was the US in relation to Indigenous populations and Afro-Americans.   China isn\'t replacing the culture of minorities in Xinjiang--so the analogy is meaningless. Fails entirely to map.   Salafism is not native to Xinjiang. Hasn\'t existed there in the thousands of years Islam has been around. Islam has existed in China for almost as long as Islam has existed *anywhere*.   Also worth noting the vast majority of Muslim nations have spoken out in China\'s defense over these accusations of genocide.    Michelle Bachelet met with the leaders of the XUAR, visited a re-education school, visited a prison, toured Xinjiang, and gave it virtually nothing but glowing praise. There is no investigation because there is no *credible claim* that there is *anything* to be investigated.   Leftists were up in arms because the US invaded a sovereign nation. If *Afghanistan* had started re-educating Afghans in a secular and non-genocidal way, leftists would absolutely not be ""up in arms"".  Edit: You raise an interesting point. The US *did* re-educate Afghans. We propped up a puppet government and built them schools and educated them according to our desires. That was not the part most leftists had a problem with. The invading a sovereign nation and sticking around for decades predicated on a lie was.    Yes. The guy\'s commentary is *about* how the article is evidence.    Answered it since the beginning. All you had to do was go look at the article. I am not your tutor.   Because that\'s not how claims of guilt *work*. If you don\'t *know* if someone is guilty, they\'re *not* guilty. If you don\'t *know* if there is an unreasonable and unevidenced thing that exists, it is *as good* as knowing it does not.  It\'s basic logic. Hitchen\'s razor in this case. A claim made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.  Not only is the evidence so weak we can dismiss the claim, we *know* for a **fact** no genocide is occurring. Again, you can go look at Xinjiang. You can go visit Xinjiang. You can watch tourists visiting Xinjiang. You can listen to people who live in Xinjiang. No evidence of genocide, and the positive absence of it. I.e. Uyghurs freely living their lives, and actively engaging in their culture without reprisal. I.e. no genocide. This evidence *strongly precludes* the **possibility** of a genocide. If people are A) not being killed, and B) not having their culture torn away from them but are very much alive and enjoying their culture, we can conclude they are not actively being genocided.   It\'s not rocket science. Trust in the basics here.  The actual Uyghurs who live in actual Xinjiang do not exist in an alternate dimension or on Mars. They can speak for themselves, and you can literally ask them. In person.  My apologies for my tone. I get it. It‚Äôs hard to find those resources. Googling this yields endless results of MSM spreading the same baseless horseshit. You want YouTube videos of random western tourists meandering around Kashgar or Urumqi and talking to Uyghurs who are clearly not experiencing a genocide? I can produce dozens. You want Han and Uyghurs who live in Xinjiang showing how ridiculous the narrative is? Those also exist.   The question you have to ask yourself is what burden of proof that something doesn‚Äôt happen is acceptable to you? Because there exists an unattainable horizon there. I can‚Äôt prove every single existing Uyghur never experienced a single ‚Äúgenocidal‚Äù act, for instance. But that is a very unreasonable burden. Genocide, as defined, is systemic and intentional. A plan or pogrom which brings about the destruction of a national, religious, ethnic, or racial group in whole or in part. I can prove that shit didn‚Äôt happen. Already have.', ' Except there\'s no evidence *of* a genocide, and they\'re not *hiding* anything. Xinjiang is a *tourist* location. Cambodia *was* trying to hide their genocide, they didn\'t celebrate Chinese or Vietnamese culture. The very nature of committing a genocide is that you despise the culture you\'re targeting. There is an ideological motivation behind it. One which can be evidenced. None is evidenced here.   Article is linked in the video. &lt;3   The US lies when they visit Israel. The evidence *there* is everywhere. There\'s a reason most nations on the planet and the UN unequivocally condemn Israel\'s actions regarding Palestine. The evidence in Xinjiang is non-existent. Even the Western media has admitted to that, in so many words.  It went from ""bodily genocide"" claims, which were completely unevidenced, to ""cultural genocide"" claims which are *completely unevidenced*, which are contradicted by China placing Uyghur culutral traditions on the UNESCO world heritage roster, and by them celebrating, promoting, and protecting Uyghur and Kazakh and Hui culture, to claims of ""museumification"" or ""commodification"" of Uyghur culture. Which is meaningless.  Uyghur books are sold in book stores, tourists visit Xinjiang daily, Uyghur dance is celebrated (and China has added it to the UNESCO roster), Uyghur music is celebrated, both are taught in state schools, Islam is taught in state schools, there are more mosques than ever before, etc.   In short, there was never any concrete evidence for the Western media\'s claim to begin with. The accusations came, almost exclusively, from two sources: the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and Adrian Zenz. Neither are reliable. Neither are reputable. ASPI is a think tank that is funded by a dozen military industrial contractors, and the US government directly, and Adrian Zenz is an ideologically motivated notorious propagandist.  The media just doesn\'t care. There is a definite and demonstrable bias where the average Western outlet will lower its standards and uncritically amplify baseless stories about ""enemy"" nations.   The 2014 article from the BBC is important to point out that terrorism, massive, widespread terrorism *really did* exist in Xinjiang according to even Western sources. Mass stabbings of hundreds of people, moderate imams being assassinated in broad daylight, bombings of the capital, all done by ""East Turkistan"" separatists. Radical Wahhabist/Salafist terrorists who the US supported. Who were cutting people\'s ears off for being drunk, who were bullying women into wearing the hijab, who were killing moderate muslim clerics who were speaking out against them.  In this context China *did* crackdown in Xinjiang, after decades of terrorism. They *did* force radicals who expressed terrorist sympathies into schools. They *did* make sure they learned Mandarin, a trade, and the law of China. They *did* imprison those who committed violent acts. And they *admit* to this.   It\'s an example to the world, imo. A humane way to combat terrorism. As China themselves say, you give these people a trade, a future, and they will turn away from extremism. If they have a good life, they won\'t want to sacrifice it doing stupid shit.  We reported on it in the worst possible light. China had a massive terrorism problem and built schools. The US got hit by terrorism and bombed an entire region of the world for twenty years.  Anywho, you can visit Xinjiang if you doubt it. People do. Kashgar and Urumqi are tourist destinations. People hike in Xinjiang. People camp in Xinjiang. People live in Xinjiang. People who live Xinjiang, some of them, make Youtube content. Tourists post videos, etc.  The *worst* thing I\'ve heard from reputable sources was that Uyghurs were getting searched a lot at border checkpoints.  Seriously, the best evidence to contradict the narrative is put forward by China on CGTN. They admit to what they did, they show why they did it, and they show how successful it was.  They also show how much more prosperous and successful Xinjiang is now, including Uyghurs and Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities within Xinjiang.  EDIT: Regarding your reply, you can\'t show proof something has never happened. You can\'t prove a negative, most often--and you don\'t have to. The burden is on your opponent to prove the positive. That something DID happen.   That\'s why people are innocent until proven guilty and not guilty until proven innocent--because proving something didn\'t happen is an unreasonable and nearly impossible standard. Proving there AREN\'T invisible pink unicorns on the moon is not a reasonable ask--the reasonable position is to ask the person who claims there are to prove it.   Debunking the weak ass evidence behind the claims *of* genocide is enough to completely dismiss the claim as spurious. Beyond that, just looking at Xinjiang today, seeing happy Uyghurs playing with happy Han, and Uyghur books in bookstores and Uyghur cuisine on the streets and Uyghur music in the coffee shops and Ugyhur dance is sufficient. Proof positive. No genocide occurred--if it did it was weak and ineffectual as fuck.  If China *wanted* to genocide Uyghurs they have the power to do that. The entire story of them pussyfooting around to slowly kind of but kind of not genocide Uyghurs is a fucking joke. The fever dream of sinophobes.

I also know that the heat transfer through brass will heat up the whole chamber and‚Äîsubsequently‚Äîthe barrel much faster, so the theory that polymer absorbs the heat or does not transfer it as it is ejected makes sense. It also makes sense how this would reduce the overall heating of the weapon. How it works in practice is something I have to take their word on.', ""Look at it a different way. Most polymers are pretty good thermal insulators while brass is a great thermal *conductor.* Any excess heat in the brass becomes heat in the chamber pretty quickly until the brass is ejected.  For anyone reading bad at thermodynamics, the brass will still be hot because it's ejected quickly AND it can't transfer ALL of its heat to something that's also hot.  With an insulator in the chamber, more of that thermal energy stays in the gas going down the barrel and out of the gun rather than being conducted into the chamber itself. That gas *could potentially* add more heat to the barrel instead, but gas isn't *nearly* as good at transferring that heat as brass is. Also in theory the gas is moving faster this way, so that's less time to transfer that heat so it might balance out.   Once the casing is ejected, the polymer will *probably* be warm to the touch at most instead of hot, even though the air inside it will probably still be as hot if not hotter.""]"

I apply my personal virtues in almost every part of my life. I teach it to my kids, and my wife has even adopted it.   There will never be an ""Ancapistan"" in a closed system. The earth, as it stands right now, is a closed system. Everything is explored, everything is owned. You cannot have freedom inside a prison. It HAS been tried and experienced many times. Every frontier is another instance of anarcho-capitalism. But there\'s only one frontier left and we aren\'t ready for it.  That being said, Ancapistan requires an open system, say, once we invent reliable and convenient travel to other stars. There will always be MORE space to go to so those who wish for freedom will always be able to find it, and others that believe the same that they do. People in the core of civilization will probably continue to develop governments, but the Frontier will be filled with freedom loving ancaps for all eternity. Maybe space travel in that magnitude will never happen, but if it did, such a system seems obvious.  Anyway.   I\'ll always be a Voluntaryist. Not only because I know that\'s the right thing morally, but because I\'m a Christian and it\'s a fundamental part of my spiritual beliefs. So with that off the table, the only thing that\'s left is the simulation.  I\'m a writer and a world builder. I literally run a simulation of worlds with free markets and governments and everything else. My interest in what happens to civilizations indifferent circumstances is where my interest in anarcho-capitalism comes from.  That being said, I\'ve run through some ideas on a separate post I made, and here\'s what I found.  Although some businesses will be immune to unions and violent takeovers due to being benevolent (a ""George Bailey"" business), there will always be businesses that mistreat and try to take advantage of their employees (a ""Scrooge"" business).   If enough ""Scrooge"" businesses spawn unions due to their poor management of money and mistreatment of employees, such a union could federate and potentially become corrupt. IF that is possible, then it is also possible the union could have a tyrannical and skilled politican as its leader, which inevitably leads to the creation of a state that would spread like cancer, feeding off of every ""Scrooge"" business they can find.  The remaining free businesses would be forced to either rally together to defend against the growing Union Federation (thus likely creating an entire other state), or they would be mowed down by its influence.  There only needs to be the possibility of this happening in order to make it inevitable.  If it\'s inevitable, then anarcho-capitalism can only ever be a temporary phenomenon (at least in a closed system).']"

I created a map that has just the states that are absolutely safe for both parties. I left off AZ, NV, NM, MN, WI, MI, GA, NC, PA, NH, and ME. At this point, Democrats have 203 EVs and Republicans have 218, with 117 uncounted. If Trump is on the ballot in any of those swing states, the Democrat will easily win the state, because Trump and the Republican will split the vote. So Trump would have to stay off the ballot in at least half of the swing states in order for the nobody-gets-270 scenario to occur. I agree with you that Trump's not out for anyone but himself, but let's assume that he stays off (or can't get on) the ballot in enough swing states to not automatically throw the election to the Democrats and the swing states break in a way that leads to a 270-268 Republican win. In order to peel off an EV from the Republicans, Trump would have to run and win in one of those 4 extremely Republican states I mentioned in an earlier comment.   So to recap, the following would all have to occur:  * Trump rejects or is denied ballot access in enough swing states to keep the Democrat from automatically winning (67 EVs worth) * The swing states break roughly evenly, maybe with a slight D lean * Trump wins at minimum 1 of 4 extremely Republican states, depending on how the swing states break. Again, these are the only states he could possibly win with both a Democrat and Republican also on the ballot.   I agree it's technically possible, but the amount of control that would be needed to manage that chaos is really really high. It's been fun to hypothesize about though.  edit: shit, I forgot to mention that it's also extremely unlikely that the House of Representatives would choose Trump over the Republican nominee. And really, in a scenario where Trump and the Republican combine for 270+ EVs, there wouldn't have to be much shenanigans going on for the House to choose the Republican to be president.

It\'s that you are still so young and haven\'t taisted what the real world is truly like. To form such strong opinions at your age is not particularly wise.  No joke, at your age I barely knew what ""sexism"" meant. I also didn\'t really know what ""feminism"" meant. And I think that\'s a good thing, regardless of how weird that sounds. Because what that means is that I went through my teenage years not being exposed to this awful topic and I never was brainwashed by excessive social media feminist pandering, unlike people (especially girls) from your generation. You\'ve grown up in a time where being a ""feminist"" is considered the default (at least publicly). I have seen young women become extremely radicalized over the last ten years. This is stuff that you couldn\'t possibly comprehend. I\'m talking about a time when you could barely even read.  Trust me, in ten years, you will cringe at the opinions and prejudices you have now... and you will realize just how ignorant you truly were. And that\'s not a personal attack, it\'s true for everyone. But I do take issue with lack of self-awareness. Everyone is oblivious at your age. EVERYONE. So was I. Still am to some degree I suppose. But I didn\'t freaking pretend otherwise either. I didn\'t act like I had the world figured out. Meanwhile, you talk about history &amp; feminism as if you\'re an expert. Don\'t lie to me &amp; yourself, we both know very well that you have never seriously researched feminism &amp; its literature. Your understanding of feminism is extremely superficial.  ""it‚Äôs something that affects me and other women on the daily""  Yeah... now multiply that by a billion and then you know what men are going through. Women are simply not being demonized 24/7 by men, least of all by the media, academia, entertainment &amp; education or politics. That objectively does not happen whatsoever. There has literally been research on this (admittedly, I don\'t remember the exact source). But it showed that ""men"" as a group are talked about in a negative light the majority of the time in the media. No such bias exists against women.  Don\'t tell me you know what it feels like to open the internet &amp; see a dozen ""kill all women"" posts. Don\'t tell me you know what it feels like to watch TV &amp; hear something along the lines of ""women are trash"". Don\'t tell me you know what it\'s like to listen to the radio and for some guest to appear and talk about how privileged women are and how they are responsible for all of human suffering. Women are NOT demonized en masse.

I waited until I was 18 to change my gamertag so people wouldn‚Äôt shit on me for being a woman when I die""  I\'m sorry but if this is the extent of your ""oppression"" in life, I can\'t take that seriously &amp; all you proved is how privileged you truly are. If you can\'t handle generic video game trash-talk, then mute the chat or don\'t use a mic. 99% of online gamers don\'t use a mic. Those times have passed. You were literally 5 years old when the peak of trash-talking happened (CoD MW2). And that was overwhelmingly (young) guys shitting on other guys.  ""Sounds dumb, but it‚Äôs genuinely a thing""  It IS dumb and I couldn\'t care less even if it was a ""thing"". Literally no one is going to ""shit on you"" in an online game if you die. No one has the time to look at your gamertag and follow the leaderbord during a game. That\'s just silly. They might harass you if you talk with the mic, but again, if that bothers you, don\'t use the mic.        ""You probably don‚Äôt take it all too seriously because I‚Äôm young, but these problems are just as valid to me as they would be to someone in their mid 30‚Äôs""  I was circumcized as a young boy because men don\'t have genital integrity rights anywhere in the world. That\'s a REAL fucking issue. You\'re goddamn right I don\'t take you seriously if you\'re going to whine about something so petty as ""potential online harassment"". Btw, Pew Research shows that men face more online abuse anyway. It\'s not a ""female"" issue.        ""Yes, I don‚Äôt have all the answers to the original concept of feminism.

""But I can assure that when women wanted jobs, to go to school, to vote, it wasn‚Äôt their intention for those horrible things to happen to men""  Wtf are you even talking about? Women have ALWAYS WORKED. This is what I mean when I say your generation has been brainwashed by feminism. Women have always went to schools. There are records of female voters dating back 400 years. You could say there were barriers, but feminism has deliberately ignored the reasons as to WHY those barriers existed in the first place. Fundamentally, it had absolutely nothing to do with ""oppressing women"". Also, all men got the vote a meager TEN years before the suffragettes got the vote. And this is interpreted by feminists as men ""always having all the rights for thousands of years"". This is SUCH a joke.  And it\'s not true to say it ""wasn\'t their intention"". It was EXPLICITLY their intention, as they were more than happy to enforce &amp; perpetuate it.        ""If all that was normalized then, I think women would‚Äôve been drafted""  Bullshit. Anyone in any relevant position who\'s pushed for women\'s inclusion in the draft has always been immediately blocked, to this very day.  ""But it wasn‚Äôt normalized, hence why women had no part in it. Nowadays we see women participating in going to war because their opportunities have grown.""  For fuck\'s sake... there is a very big difference between being ""allowed"" to go to war, and being FORCED to. I don\'t give a shit if a very minute % of women ""want to fight"". What I care about is that MILLIONS OF MEN were FORCED to. If war breaks out in Europe with all the fuckery going on right now, I will be drafted &amp; there\'s nothing I can do about it.        ""It‚Äôs not about equality at this point, it‚Äôs equity. Both genders have different needs that need be met in different ways.""  Right.... can you even name me one legitimate female issue? I\'ve asked several women this question and NOT ONE has been able to give me an answer that wasn\'t complete bullshit.', 'Oh how convenient... ""all the comments were I was insulted were deleted"". Sure buddy. I checked your comment history and you were never insulted or belittled at all, and certainly NOT ""because"" you are a woman. That literally never happened.  ""If you face sexism with women, it‚Äôs not hard to believe we face it with men""  No one denies sexism against women exist. But if you want to make it a competition, the APA has quite clearly shown that women have an insanely bigger in-group preference than men (and by proxy, out-group bias \\*against\\* men). Men on the other hand, actually are more generous, kind &amp; forgiving towards WOMEN than they are towards their own gender. So while sexist men exist for sure, they are nowhere near close to the amount of sexist women out there.        ""So, how many posts do you think are on here, and how many of those posts do you think we BOTH come across?""  I visit this sub daily &amp; at the very least I read all the post titles... The vast, vast, VAST majority have nothing ""sexist"" about them.   ""And key word - rarely. So you do see it happen?""  Yes but if you\'re leaving for what you now acknowledge is a RARE occurance, then you were never serious about men\'s issues in the first place. You\'re 17, right? I honestly think you\'re just way too young to have a meaningful take on these sorts of topics. Not only are you in a very sensitive period in your life as a young woman, you frankly don\'t have the life experience. If a few ""mean internet words"" really bother you that much, that\'s fine. But then I advice you to delete all your social media in general. Lastly, at your age you shouldn\'t be lecturing men about the glorious history of feminism and ""what it truly meant"". You have absolutely no clue about its history at all, which would be fine if you weren\'t so hellbent on being right despite your ignorance. You can say that feminism was about ""equality"" all you want, but there is no evidence to support that AT ALL. The Declaration of Sentiments 1848 was explicitly anti-male &amp; female supremacist in nature. This book is basically regarded as the feminist Bible. Even the suffragettes couldn\'t care less about real equality. They were extremely racist, classist and sexist towards men... just appreciate that they were fighting for their petty right to vote during the same time when MILLIONS of men were forcibly sent off to fight in wars they wanted nothing to do with to be blown to shreds. Where was the outcry from feminists? Where were the marches to include women in the draft? Ah right, never happened... and what actually happened is that feminists spearheaded the white feather campaign, which shamed men into enlisting by branding them as cowards if they failed to do so (which led to many men killing themselves from social ridiculue). And THIS is what you claim is a movement ""for equality"" and ""wasn\'t against men""? Fuck outta here.  ""There‚Äôs a link included and a short explanation from my perspective.""  There is no link.        ""I‚Äôm sorry, have you met the other 4 billion women on this world and listened to their sides?""  What a joke. Do you think all studies poll 8 billion people for the sake of ""credibility"" and ""accuracy""? Of course not. An unbiased selective population sample more than suffices. In other words, a few hundred people is enough to make certain conclusions.  While I won\'t claim to know ""hundreds of women"" on a personal level, I have at least met dozens, if not close to a hundred (relatively well I mean). If I add the women I see online, that would easily be thousands. And YES, the VAST MAJORITY of (young) women, especially if college educated and middle/upper class, are \\*EXTREMELY\\* resentful towards men... in a way that does NOT happen from men to women. Like AT ALL.  ""To me it just seems hard for you to believe women would stand up for men based on what you‚Äôve seen""  It\'s not what I\'ve seen, it\'s factually the case. Most women get extremely furious when I bring up an issue like circumcision because ""it\'s just a piece of skin"" and ""it\'s not a big deal"" and ""FGM is so much worse"" and ""you\'re downplaying that women have it worse"" or what have you (all things I have been told REPEATEDLY by women, even those that are NOT particularly big fans of feminism). There hasn\'t been ONE woman I\'ve ever talked to who thinks MGM is a real issue. And ALL of them have become angry with me the few times I\'ve brought it up. ALL of them.  If women can\'t even show the tiniest slice of compassion for an issue that is so CLEARLY and OBVIOUSLY wrong in every way, what chance do you genuinely believe there is that women will be compassionate towards issues like lack of reproductive &amp; parental rights for men (which are far more controversial and may end up taking away power from women, explaining why there would be a greater pushback from women)? Or things like equalizing domestic violence funding? Cancer research? Etc.   You can live in your little feminist fantasy world where women are oh so kind towards men and are incredibly supportive, but that\'s just not true at all. I\'m sorry.  I see quite a lot of women like you claiming to be sympathetic ONLINE, but actions speak louder than words. I am not lying when I say I have a grand total of ZERO women irl who are sympathetic towards men\'s issues. NOT ONE. Most men I know may not be avid feminists, but they at least show compassion towards things like sexual harassment or DV or what have you.  ""I argue on this a lot. Feminism vs. modern feminism""  Yeah I\'ve seen that. And like I said, you are completely fucking wrong about that. Stop clinging unto this asinine premise that ""feminism used to be good, it\'s really all about equality"". That simply isn\'t true and it never happened that way.  ""Sir, I can tell you‚Äôve seen lots of toxicity from women. But I can guarantee some of us don‚Äôt have our heads stuck in our ass and would much rather see both genders have equality/peace than just the one.""  Yes I believe that there are SOME women like that. But they are a tiny minority. That doesn\'t mean ""most women are extreme man-haters who want all men to die"", but what it does mean is that even relatively ""good"" women will become quite hostile when the topic of men\'s issues is raised. If I raise these topics irl, I\'m guaranteed to lose female friends or face social rejection and ridiculue. Be labelled an ""incel"". A ""misogynist"". etc etc.        ""It‚Äôs cool if you think they‚Äôre lies, but just remember you‚Äôre choosing to believe women are just out to get you""  It\'s not what I ""believe"" at all. It\'s what is clearly the case. And it\'s also not that women are deliberately out there waiting to beat and abuse men. Again, it\'s that women in general are extremely hostile towards the topic of men\'s issues.  ""We‚Äôre allowed to support you and view other things differently""  If those ""different views"" include a feminist framework, then no, you cannot ""support us"". Feminism is antithetical to men\'s rights/issues. Period.', 'First off, I‚Äôm doing two parts because it won‚Äôt let me post the whole thing.

2068	13	2068_milk_meat_canaanites_cow	['milk', 'meat', 'canaanites', 'cow', 'animals', 'rituals', 'milked', 'calf', 'israelites', 'goat']	"[""You're trying to apply 2022 logic to 1500 BC.  All of the stuff about what is good to eat is about disease. Sure, in 2022 pork and shellfish are safe enough, because we can pretty well guarantee proper cooking. That was much harder to do 3500 years ago. All the stuff about hooves and cud and scales and whatnot is just a generalization to get around listing every possible animal.  The fat part is logical even in your statement. The fat is the part reserved for God. If you eat the fat *and* the meat (which was to be eaten) you aren't really sacrificing anything.  The blood part is mostly about disease. They clearly had some idea of how disease was spread, even without germ theory. Blood can be a major vector for it, and therefore was avoided (and not just in consumption). Additionally, at the time there were pagan rituals involving consumption of blood, which a Jew would wish to avoid for obvious reasons.  The milk and meat thing is also referring to pagan rituals, and is specific to the animal. Cheese from one cow and meat from another would be fine. As for mixing meat and cheese generally in the modern age, it's an issue of possibilities. Not all Jews, even those who keep Kosher, consider it an issue, but there is a chance, however small, that the same animal produced both."", ""Dw about not knowing the process, I only learned about it a few months ago. Basically, cows only produce milk right after having given birth to a calf, as the milk is specifically for the calf. So in order to get them to produce milk, they have to masturbate a bull and collect its semen, and then use it to impregnate a cow, usually with a turkey baster or something similar. Once the calf is born they take it away from the mother, if it's female they raise it as another dairy cow and if it's male they kill it-sometimes for veal, sometimes they just scrap it. This is more efficient for factory farms(and some normal farms even) which means they can produce more milk and get more profits etc. This isn't something they tend to do on beef farms, which is why I specify this to milk"", ' It\'s part of a rabbinical overextension of the law, repeated multiple times in the Torah, that ""thou shalt not seethe (boil) a kid (baby goat) in its mother\'s milk.  The rabbis then extended this waaaay beyond that literal act of boiling a baby goat in its mother\'s milk to ***any*** mixing of meat and milk, in any context, regardless of the species involved, even extending it to poultry that literally cannot produce milk (e.g. chickens).  Now to understand what I\'m about to say, to explain why the reasoning for the base version of the law above, it\'s important to understand the historical context in which early Jewish law was created. Early in Jewish history, the Israelites were surrounded by the Canaanite polytheists, to whom they were diametrically opposed, both because they were at war with them over the land of Israel, and because they were polytheists and the Israelites were (obviously) monotheists. The Canaanites worshipped their gods through various rituals, and much of the bizarre laws that you find in the Torah can be explained simply by saying ""yeah the Canaanites were probably doing that to worship their Gods."" By the way, this includes the biblical prohibition against homosexuality, as one of the rituals that the Canaanites performed was same-sex intercourse with a temple prostitute.  In that vein, the reasoning for this law is debated, but essentially is likely [one of the following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_and_meat_in_Jewish_law#Explanations_for_the_law):     So it was either because that\'s what the Canaanites do, or the Israelites saw that shit and went ""yo that\'s fucked up"", or both.   [From here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin#Purpose):   Makes sense within the context of a religion. It\'s very common to see these kinds of things in world religions -- objects of the faith meant to symbolize one\'s devotion.']"
2069	13	2069_alcohol_guns_unethical_murders	['alcohol', 'guns', 'unethical', 'murders', 'clarified', 'everclear', 'machines', 'reformed', 'standards', 'standard']	[' Ok sure. You said that me saying ‚Äúunethical laws should be reformed‚Äù was me creating a new standard. Look at abolition of slavery, women‚Äôs rights, civil rights, gay marriage rights. These are examples of situations where laws were reformed because they were unethical. See? I didn‚Äôt pull any standard out of thin air. It was an existing standard.    Guns are not the same as humans. Unless you‚Äôre trying to argue with me that guns have nerves and blood vessels and sentience, you can‚Äôt apply gun laws to people. Guns are killing machines. Alcohol isn‚Äôt. If it was, then why don‚Äôt we use alcohol in wars instead of guns? So yeah, these are objective differences between guns and the objects you compared them to. Still waiting for you to prove me wrong.   Already addressed this but guess you didn‚Äôt pay attention. Guns are dangerous killing machines, alcohol isn‚Äôt. So it‚Äôs safe to have alcohol in homes, not guns. Objective difference between guns and alcohol. If alcohol was as dangerous as guns, why aren‚Äôt they used in wars instead of guns?    Then go to the shooting range. No need to have guns in your home.    Wanna play a game where I give you a massacre caused by guns for every massacre caused by alcohol that you give me? I would win so easily because anyone with a basic amount of common sense knows that guns are lethal killing machines and alcohol isn‚Äôt. Talk to the families of tall the victims of school shootings if you want to use that logic on me.', ' I clarified what I meant there a long time ago because I clearly misspoke. I had said that in response to you saying that people violating gun laws are thrown into jail to reduce suicides. I responded by saying that they are thrown into jail because they violated a law. Go back to that comment if you don‚Äôt believe me. My mistake was using the word ‚Äúshould‚Äù instead of the word ‚Äúare‚Äù. But I clarified my meaning. I also clarified that punishment for violating laws occurs because that‚Äôs how laws fundamentally work. If they didn‚Äôt, no one would follow any laws. After that, I also made it clear that if a law itself is unethical, it should be reformed because enforcing it would be unethical. Just because something is legal doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ethical. I didn‚Äôt make up any new standards. This is quite literally common sense and anyone with common sense would agree with me.    No, I brought up fundamental differences between guns and alcohol that makes your analogy invalid. In case you don‚Äôt know how analogies work, the comparison has to be valid 1) Alcohol is something that people consume for fun, and if used in moderation, it has minimal health risks. It isn‚Äôt normally used to hurt people and it doesn‚Äôt cause mass murder. The examples you brought up about the driving accidents are examples where alcohol is illegal: you can‚Äôt drive while drunk. 2) Guns are dangerous killing machines that have the ability to cause mass murders. I can give you a long list of examples of schools shootings and people using guns to mass murder people. They have no use unless you want to hurt people. If you want to do target practice, you can use paintball guns, other fake guns, or just go to a shooting range where you can use a gun for target practice. If you want to protect yourself, you can use knives, hammers, or any other household object.     I didn‚Äôt create any standards. Multiple standards already exist and I brought those into the discussion to refute the absurd claims you were making. For example, you said people should be killed because they aren‚Äôt needed like guns. And I said that people are sentient beings, not guns. This is an objective fact, not just some random standard I made up. Another example: where I said that if a law is unethical, it should be changed. Again, I didn‚Äôt make up a new standard. Ask anyone and they will agree with me. I again just brought it into the conversation to refute your claims. I didn‚Äôt just make it up.   It‚Äôs funny you are the one saying that, the person that compared getting rid of guns to getting rid of people (who are sentient living beings, not objects like guns) and the same person who compared enforcing gun laws to the holocaust (which is one of the biggest atrocities committed in history). I never once said that no person has been protected by a gun. I said that there are literal studies that prove that guns harm more than they protect. Saying ownership of explosives is illegal is not psychotic, it‚Äôs the law and for good reason. They are extremely dangerous. I also gave you many options that fulfill the same purpose as guns, so there‚Äôs no need to have guns.    Nope. Drunk driving is one scenario where alcohol is harmful and that‚Äôs why we have laws against it. Alcohol otherwise used in moderation has minimal health risks. Guns are inherently dangerous and lethal. I‚Äôve given you alternatives for all the uses of guns, so there‚Äôs no need to own something so dangerous. What‚Äôs the alternative to drinking alcohol that would produce the same effect that causes people to enjoy alcohol?', ' Nope. I clarified myself many times and how my wording was wrong.   I was explaining the reason, not asserting whether it‚Äôs right or wrong. I already said that I shouldn‚Äôt have used the words ‚Äúshould be punished‚Äù but rather ‚Äúare punished‚Äù. That‚Äôs what I had meant and I made it clear that I misspoke.   Nope. I‚Äôve addressed it many times but I‚Äôll address it again. It‚Äôs unethical because people shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to have dangerous killing machines that have caused mass murders and that they don‚Äôt need.   Nope again. I already explained how I misspoke and clarified myself in the first example (that‚Äôs not making anything up). Also, saying that unethical laws should be changed is not a new standard. It‚Äôs an existing standard. Look at laws through history up to now that have been reformed. Ask anyone with common sense.   Then go to a shooting range for target practice. No need to own guns in your home   Ask all the families of all the victims of the school shootings and gun massacres that have occurred in America. I can give you so many more examples of mass murders caused by guns than you can give me of ‚Äúmass murders‚Äù caused by alcohol. Do people use guns or alcohol in war to cause damage? America is a laughing stock for other countries because of the amount of shootings that happen here, and the fact that people like you ignore the glaring evidence that guns are more harmful than they protect. The studies literally show that people like you have a ‚Äúknowledge deficit‚Äù in the statistics regarding guns, which is why you live in denial. You can‚Äôt cause mass murder with alcohol, you can cause it with guns. And since you keep mentioning the Carrollton bus collision, I already said that we have laws against drunk driving to prevent that. No matter what laws you make, some people will violate those laws. But making the laws cuts down on the frequency of people doing harmful things.    1) No ones forcing you to go near a pitbull 2) There‚Äôs plenty of options to eat meat, so you don‚Äôt need elk, 3) go to a shooting range and borrow a gun. There are alternatives for all the uses of guns. So you don‚Äôt need one unless you want to hurt others.   Give me the statistics on how many grandmas absolutely needed a gun to protect themselves when they had things like knives, hammers, police, etc available   They did already existed. I only added them because you didn‚Äôt have the common sense to understand them already. Like the fact that guns are not sentient like people. Just cause I add something doesn‚Äôt mean that it didn‚Äôt already exist. If someone walks into a room, does that mean they didn‚Äôt exist before entering the room?   Lmaoooooooo, are you that desperate that you‚Äôre literally making something up that i never said üòÇ? And you‚Äôre the one accusing me of making stuff up.     Yes it did, and that‚Äôs why a lot of laws have been reformed lmao. Like laws to ban slavery and promote equal rights. So unless you want to deny history and what the majority of people will say, I‚Äôm not making anything up   I already explained multiple times how I misspoke in the first quote and if you‚Äôre so desperate to win that you keep ignoring that, that‚Äôs on you buddy.   Putting words in my mouth again I see. Give me the proof where I said that. I‚Äôm advocating for getting rid of guns, not people who own them, which can be enforced without hurting people.   Let me just jog my memory on how guns protect people. Oh wait that‚Äôs right. By hurting other people    Some explosives are illegal.    Like I said above, give me the statistics on how often that‚Äôs necessary   Yep and guns also increase homicides and mass murders, not just suicide. They are inherently dangerous. If alcohol was as dangerous as guns, then why can‚Äôt people use alcohol instead of guns in wars?   Is everclear the only type of alcohol that people consume?   I never said guns shouldn‚Äôt be used in war, I‚Äôve been referring to domestic ownership. Also, since you own a gun, why don‚Äôt you go liberate Ukraine?']

I have no objections on a semantic level whether stakeholders does or does not include shareholders.  What I object to is the idea that people who do not spend money purchasing a share of a company should in any way be considered ""owners"" in that company or have any decision making powers whatsoever, such as votes. Whether we call these people stakeholders or not is totally irrelevant. But I think you and I can both agree these people are probably best called stakeholders. Unless you like a different definition, I suggest we stick with it.  And if that\'s our definition, then *obviously* stakeholders includes shareholders. It will also include other people. If you want a different definition such that stakeholders and shareholders are synonymous (rather than the one being a superset of the other), we can have that conversation, and it will result in the same underlying conclusions. I\'m just saying I don\'t care what definition we use, as long as we\'re consistent.  But lets back up to the original discussion for context. One person said stakeholders should have votes. The other person replied that only shareholders should have votes. Then you replied that stakeholders would include shareholders. This is an obvious point that no one was disputing, so it was useless to bring it up. The real question is not nor ever was about whether shareholders should get a vote. It was about whether the extra people who are stake holders but *not* shareholders should get a vote. And we say no, they shouldn\'t.  British citizens have a *stake* in american elections, since our foreign policy very much bleeds into theirs. But does that mean British citizens should have a vote in american elections? It is the same with company meetings. I fully comprehend that many people who don\'t own shares in a company have some sort of stake in the company. Maybe the company is their employer. Maybe a company is their supplier, or in a chain of their supplier\'s. Do these people get a vote on the board? no. They don\'t. It\'s not their property.  My neighbors have a stake in how I keep my lawn, since the trees might provide them shade, or block a view. But it\'s my property, and I bought it, and If I want to chop down that dang sycamore I\'m going to, and I don\'t care how much you like that shade.

In my comments i was merely highlighting how a stakeholder is merely a category and shareholder is a subset of that category. But it seems as if i replied my original comment to the wrong person.', 'They are indeed shareholders, but my argument never at any point described stakeholders as owners. You specifically defined stakeholders and shareholders as being mutually exclusive concepts then i disagreed with you with multiple definitions and a link.

If you‚Äôre a fast learner, Tier 1 should last 6 months before you get to tier 2, and another 12 months before tier 3 or sysadmin. Couple more years, then you can transition to a role in which most of your time is scripting. After that, you can find a Junior dev role  It‚Äôs not glamorous, but you‚Äôll make money the whole way through, and you‚Äôll be much more technically experienced when you get to being a backend dev or other dev role than the new CS hires', 'Having a 4-year degree is valuable because it shows you stuck with something for four years and have enough skill to pass your capstone. I hear you regarding filtering if you‚Äôre talking about recruiter filtering, but if you knew how many resumes came through every day and how rare it is to find someone that skilled without a college degree or some level of experience (independent contractor, etc.), you‚Äôd understand as well.   The whole point of a technical interview is to allow those who have significant technical skill to be able to get a job. If I get a resume that contains links to multiple amazing web apps someone has built but they didn‚Äôt get a degree, I don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs why CS is amazing: CS jobs have the lowest bar to entry of any of the high paying careers. Being a doctor or lawyer means you have to go to school for much longer, are required to pass challenging examinations, and are required to perform continuing education in order to get a high paying job. In any other field, going from a $60K/year job to a $230K/year job is unheard of, and yet in CS, it‚Äôs easily doable provided you have the skill.   How would you restructure the hiring process? Bear in mind: Interviews are expensive from the perspective of a company. Each candidate‚Äôs interview process normally costs the company at least $500 just in salaries alone. Why would a company want to take a chance on someone who shows no tangible experience when they have the opportunity to hire others who do have tangible experience, even if all of that experience was while they were an undergraduate?', 'Good question! So the hardest part, if you have technical skill but no 4-year degree, is to get past the resume screen. This is typically done by a recruiter or HR, and they typically see a resume without a college degree and want to toss it because they‚Äôre boomers who don‚Äôt know that people can have technical skill without college.   You can try to get past it by putting relevant experience. If you‚Äôve created any web apps or standalone applications, put them in the ‚Äúrelevant experience‚Äù section of your resume. Something like  * May 2018-July 2018: Built an e-commerce website that had the capacity to facilitate 300,000 transactions per day * October 2018-March 2020: Built a file sharing website that gave users the ability to upload and download a variety of different files  Once you get into the interview phase, they‚Äôll ask about these. First, talk about your architecture. If you used a VM on your machine and connected to it, say something like ‚ÄúI used VMware Fusion and ran a RHEL 8 server which hosted the application. Networking-wise, I bridged the server with my laptop‚Äôs network card, and hosted the application on my local network at first. Once I verified that that was functional, I opened the port on my router and forwarded it to my laptop, which forwarded traffic on that port to my VM, which server up the website to any clients that connected to my public IP.   Then, talk about your app: ‚ÄúI used Python and FastAPI and hosted it with Hypercor ‚Äù or ‚ÄúI used PHP and hosted it with Nginx‚Äù. Talk about any routes you used, and what your app does specifically. ‚ÄúI have a health route that can be tied to a load balancer to make sure the app is healthy. I also have a downloadFile route that takes a file name as a parameter and returns the file as a byte stream. This way, the full file is not loaded in memory at once. The byte stream is sent to the client, which is then downloaded as a file to the client‚Äôs filesystem.‚Äù  Finally, make sure to talk in detail about any challenges you faced and how you overcame them. As an interviewer, I want to hear those above all else. Also, talk about mistakes you made and how you fixed them. I‚Äôve worked in the industry long enough to know that anyone who says they haven‚Äôt made any mistakes either hasn‚Äôt worked in industry long enough to make any, or is too proud to admit them.   Overall, good luck! If you‚Äôre going the self-taught route, it‚Äôs hard because it requires a lot of discipline, but if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre passionate about, just take it one concept at a time, and it‚Äôll add up before you know it!']

To suggest I ""might"" be doing them a ""disservice"" for no other reason than that you don\'t like homeschooling is fucked up. The problem here is that you aren\'t willing to address your prejudice. Grow up.', '\\-The education system in the US is broken:  \\-Yes, it is. And yes, it‚Äôs not for the reasons the right-wingers think it is. When your job is literally to teach children to read and illiteracy rates are as high as they are in the US, there is a problem. Even if there were no other issues with the education system, I think that would be reason enough to consider homeschooling. After all, reading is one of the most fundamental skills needed to simply survive in our society.  \\-The homeschooling movement is deeply connected to the right wing:  \\-I can understand this concern. Early homeschool advocates were concerned formal schools were oppressive and only taught kids to be compliant employees (John Holt) and that early education was detrimental to a child‚Äôs development (Raymond Moore). However, in the 1980s, rightwing Christians co-opted the movement so that they could basically indocrinate their kids into their own belief system. There is no doubt that that is wrong. And for a while most homeschool curricula that were available pushed those agendas. Unfortunately, that control lasted through the 90s. However, as homeschooling has gained popularity, the Christian Nationalists have a lot of their control. This has a lot to do with the internet. It‚Äôs a lot harder to avoid differing ideas/opinions if you have any access to the internet. Yes, there are still a lot of Christian Nationalist homeschools, some of whom are even worse than the Duggars. But that doesn‚Äôt make them the majority. And there are great homeschool curricula out there that would struggle to find acceptance within a public school classroom (not that a curriculum is necessary to teach kids). The pandemic in particular did a lot to remove a lot of control that was once held by the right. In the US, homeschooling went from about 3-4% of the population before the pandemic to 11% by the fall of 2020. Most of those people were homeschooling due to health concerns. Many of those families did return to public school, but many did not. More people now have a far more positive view of homeschooling as a result.

Just like far left parents are far more likely to raise far left kids, and centrist parents are far more likely to raise centrist children. If schools actually taught about politics, maybe they could be as effective at turning kids away from far right ideologies as they are at teaching kids misinformation. But they don‚Äôt. They do, however, teach patriotism and nationalism, which, if anything, is more likely to support a far right ideology in the mind of a child than it is to discourage it.  \\-Homeschooling gives parents more control over their kids:  \\-In theory, depending on the parent (a true anarchist parent wouldn‚Äôt take advantage of or accept that control). But public school doesn‚Äôt eliminate that possibility for control. It just gives it to the government/schools/teachers. And a teacher will use that control. Because they are told to, and they have to somehow teach 30 kids all the same material at the same time.  \\-Public education socializes kids:  \\-No. Participating in society socializes kids. The only reason public school kids get most of their socialization at school is because that is where they spend most of their time. And is the socialization they are getting actually good? Be quiet, don‚Äôt talk, sit still, listen, do as I say, follow the rules, line up, follow me, don‚Äôt engage in risky play, don‚Äôt experiment, follow the directions, do only what the rules say, if you break the rules you are bad. Is that what we want kids to learn? Is that how we want them to be socialized? As a homeschooler, you can socialize your kids with way more diversity. You can take them to homeschool coops (they are really common, not just something a very small percentage of homeschoolers do), sports, arts, the playground, protests (if they‚Äôre safe), etc. Socializing kids isn‚Äôt that hard. Sure, they might be ‚Äúweird.‚Äù That‚Äôs because they haven‚Äôt been bullied into conformity. Personally, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad thing. And my AuDHD, trans, anarchist ass was gonna be a weirdo regardless of where I was educated (in my case, it was public school). Frankly, I say let your freak flag fly. Embrace your weird, because there ain‚Äôt a normal one among us.  \\-Public education has led to some people becoming leftists:  \\-Sure. And it has led some to be right wingers. So what?  \\-How do we shift homeschooling towards the left and remove right wing control?  \\-Simple: more anarchists, and leftists in general, need to homeschool their own kids. The more of us who homeschool, the less control the right has.']"

Biden was criticized for getting out over his skis when he endorsed same sex marriage before Obama did.   Yes, Biden wanted diversity in his Cabinet, but in addition to Pete Buttigieg he also appointed female cabinet members, latino cabinet members, black cabinet members, a Native American cabinet member, etc. He has also made a huge effort to add diversity to the Federal bench. This is something that he thinks is important.    You're convinced it was a deal, I fundamentally disagree. Buttigieg didn't have the juice to get a deal. Biden, or more realistically, Biden's transition team, put him at Transportation because Buttigieg needs experience in order to be able to offer something to the party in the future - and he's going to have a hard time getting that experience in Indiana."", ' And besides Buttigieg and Harris, Warren was the only candidate to be vetted for anything, despite not endorsing during the primary.  She was considered for Treasury and Education Secretary.  She got closer to the cabinet than almost everyone who dropped out and endorsed Biden during the primary. So much for needing to make a deal.   And it\'s very interesting that you say Buttigieg needed a deal to decide to endorse Biden, but you can\'t even imagine Buttigieg endorsing the other candidate standing, Sanders.  So why would Biden need to offer anything when he was the only game in town?        Okay so there was no deal?  If the other side wasn\'t offering anything, what was the deal?  Buttigieg saying to himself in the mirror, ""hey, if you endorse Biden, maybe you\'ll get something""?   But what value did his endorsement have to be able to bargain with?  Like you said, he was not going to win anything beyond Iowa, so how could his endorsement be mathematically worth it for Biden to offer anything?  But then again, you say he didn\'t offer anything, so...?']"

In a diverse population, you will definitely find people that have knowledge about either or both of those topics. That poll could have an option for selecting ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know‚Äù or ‚Äúmore information needed‚Äù for people who don‚Äôt know much about either profession.  Also, notice that in my last comment, I mentioned that people would have more knowledge about well known jobs. Things like music and porn are very general and well-known professions compared to a very specific sport.    The truth is that music is objectively harder than porn. Music is skill that you have to develop, train, and get some sort of education for. Even if you‚Äôre born a good singer, there‚Äôs still a lot of theory to learn and practicing to do. Music also requires creativity, confidence, precision (when playing instrument), motivation/discipline (because it takes a lot of practice to develop finer skills in music), ability to work with a team (if you‚Äôre in band), concentration, control over breathing/tone/inflections/pitch, and so much more. And these are *bare minimum* because other you would produce bad music that would irritate people. In porn, the bare minimum is literally just feeling yourself or kissing or having sex, which are undoubtedly much much easier.   Porn also largely requires skills that biologically exist in people already. A lot of people are easy to arouse. Feeling yourself, wearing bikinis, having sex are really easy and normal things to do. Can you do more? Sure, but it‚Äôs not necessary. Unless you‚Äôre a porn addict and have high tolerance, its not hard to arouse people with your content.   In terms of attracting followers, I would say both porn and music have similar difficulties, but music is still at least slightly harder because more people have an innate desire for sexual stimulation than music.  And I‚Äôm not really sure what you were asking in your last question. Could you clarify?', 'A guess is an assertion you make without any evidence or reason   I already explained why I know that OF is much easier than making music on the basis of 1) the ‚Äúskills‚Äù it takes versus the skills required in music (OF -wearing bikinis and feeling yourself. Music - learn music theory, learn instruments/singing, market yourself because people aren‚Äôt gonna easily flock to a new artist as men would to a girl‚Äôs OF, creativity and time to make original compositions) 2) hearing from people who actually make OF and the ‚Äúeffort‚Äù they put into it versus the effort that people have to put to make music (there‚Äôs no way to succeed in music without working hard). Also, people have posted leaked photos of OF before and they‚Äôre mostly just bikini or ass pics. That takes a lot of hard I‚Äôm sure. I read an article the other day of a teacher who got fired for doing OF and the picture they showed was just her showing her breasts. 3) The fact that the things that you need to do in OF are normal sexual things that a lot of people are biologically wired to do and enjoy   So clearly, it isn‚Äôt just a random guess. I bet if you did a poll of all the people in the world or in this country and asked which is harder, making music or doing OF, I think you and I would know what the answer would be (hint: making music).', 'All the stuff you mentioned in porn is not stuff you have to do to earn money. I know plenty of women can just post bikini pics or pictures of their asses on OF and they get money for it. I read this Reddit post on AITA of this woman who took a quick break on vacation to snap a few pics for OF and went right back to her vacation. Sounds like a lot of hard work.   Standing out is one thing but singing in general is hard. I‚Äôve tried singing multiple times and I suck at it. In my music class, my classmates and I had to sing notes sometimes (we play instruments), and we were all really bad at it. Also to understand music at a deeper level, you have to take music theory classes. There‚Äôs no OF theory class or degree cause there‚Äôs nothing to learn there. To become better at music, you have to constantly practice. To be able to perform that music, you have to have a lot of confidence. Practice itself isn‚Äôt enough. I practiced music a lot but every time I had to perform, I would fuck up because of my anxiety. To stand out in music, you have to be creative enough to make unique and good compositions. And doing all this makes respect you, not devalue and objectify you. You really can‚Äôt debate that music is much harder and respectable than OF.']

Given how under reported cases of domestic abuse are, don't you think switching our default term to 'survivor' would empower people and make them more likely to report instances of abuse? If you're a victim, you're utterly helpless. If you hear others being referred to as 'survivors', maybe you can view yourself as being a survivor too (thereby suggesting there is a way out)."", ""Where would you draw the line between 'victim' and 'survivor'?

Within your three proposals, there exists a single act of determined harm from which we base our ascription off of (i.e. the person experienced **an** act of robbery \\[**likely not life-threatening**\\] and is therefore a victim).  Would things change if the *single* act was replaced by a *sequence* of actions? If someone keeps robbing you, are you still a victim? Given that robberies can usually be *avoided* rather simply and are not explicitly life threatening, yes, you're still a victim.  What if the *sequence* of actions was in a context that couldn't easily be *avoided*? You might say that people in abusive relationships/households can just leave, but it's not so black-and-white. So the situation cannot be easily *avoided*. Does a *sequence* of actions that one is *forced* to bear justify claims of survivorship? Or is the person still a victim since their life isn't in immediate danger?  Suffering is entirely subjective. Domestic Abuse is a hell that seems inescapable. When one manages to escape, isn't it valid for them to call themselves (and for us to refer to them as) survivors?  People who go through domestic abuse aren't really comparable to people who go through a robbery or people who have their fingers broken (even intentionally). Those who go through domestic abuse often times have their entire worldviews shifted in a perverse manner, with the psychological trauma they receive lasting far longer than the duration of abuse. As such, I think it's important to be mindful of the language we decide to use.""]"

The animal doesn\'t even have to be present on that day - It can be as simple as  telling family members ""Hey remember when we talked about getting a dog? Yes we are!

Then assume the defendants lost on appeal and filed a writ of habeas corpus. The prosecutor's office is now arguing that the couple's detention is lawful since they were convicted of being in an interracial marriage.  The defense attorney has a very easy job here. They merely have to point out that interracial marriage is not illegal, and therefore the detention is unlawful and the writ of habeas corpus should be granted.  The couple can easily prove factual innocence because they have not violated a law or statute. In other words, a conviction under an unconstitutional law is precisely the type of situation where a court ***would*** grant a writ of habeas corpus.""]"

We are talking about someone forming their opinion based on personal experience. I am trying to figure out if they would form a similar opinion if their negative experience was due to another group.  However, I will accept your premise for the following statement: While Swedes might commit less crimes per capita, they still commit crimes at a rate above 0. The question is if a Swede would dislike Swedes had they been a victim of a crime perpetrated by another Swede.  Please note, that I know nothing about Swedish crime."", "" First, that is not the same as:          For the first statement, if group A has a population of 100 and group B has a population of 20, and 8 people in group A commit a crime while 4 people in group B commit a crime, then the crime rate in group B is 2.5 times higher than the crime rate in group A.      However, it is still twice as likely that the victim of a crime was a victim of someone in group A.       Citing a 1997 paper in 2022 is, well, beyond failing to uphold a reasonable standard of proof.      Br√•'s own report on this question, offered in 2021, notes that:       When accounting for age differences, gender differences, and income differences, the rate of offense for immigrants is still 1.7x higher than for native Swedes, but it becomes indistinguishable from native Swedes by the second generation.      Sweden's population for October 2022 was 10,514,692.   The number of foreign born persons in Sweden is 2,090,503.      Thus the number of native Swedes was 8,424,189.     In 2021, the number of all crimes per 100,000 inhabitants according to Sweden's own government sources was 14,215.      The total number of all crimes was thus 1,494,663.      So (8,424,189 / 100,000 \\* x) + (2,090,503 / 100,000 \\* 1.7x) = 1,494,663     That resolves to: 1,787,047 crimes by native Swedes and 443,464 crimes by non-native Swedes.      Thus you are more than 4 times as likely to be victimized by a native Swede than by an immigrant.      This means your statement that:       Is completely and totally false as stated. Now, there are only two possible motivations for making such a false statement. The first is ignorance. The second is in order to demonize people based on their place of birth.      I'm sure intelligent, educated right wing commentators in Sweden make similar statements all the time.

Until the past ~150 years there were distinctions between early and late abortions and for most of Catholic history, most Catholics it wasn‚Äôt even considered an abortion prior to ensoulment (sometime between 40 days and the quickening depending on time period). In Catholic theology, something being a sin vs being *murder* is very different.  There were some oddities back then too like oral and anal sex being considered worse than an early abortion.

You can\'t just claim gross negligence, it will usually either be abundantly clear it\'s a case of gross negligence or you\'ll have very little chance of not having your case thrown out. Let\'s look at a couple definitions definitions.   [One from Cornell Law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/gross_negligence#): ""Gross negligence is a lack of care that demonstrates reckless disregard for the safety or lives of others, which is so great it appears to be a conscious violation of other people\'s rights to safety. Gross negligence is a heightened degree of negligence representing an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of care. Falling between intent to do wrongful harm and ordinary negligence, gross negligence is defined as willful, wanton, and reckless conduct affecting the life or property or another.   Gross negligence is considered more harmful than ordinary negligence because it implies a thoughtless disregard of the consequences and the failure to use even slight care to avoid harming the life or property of another.""  And one from a [Law office](https://www.freemaninjurylaw.com/blog/difference-between-negligence-gross-negligence/): ""Gross negligence is the extreme indifference to or reckless disregard for the safety of others. Gross negligence is more than simple carelessness or failure to act‚Äîit is willful behavior done with extreme disregard for the health and safety of others.  Examples of gross negligence include:  1. A driver speeding in an area with heavy pedestrian traffic; 2. A doctor prescribing a patient a drug that their medical records clearly list that they are allergic to; or 3. Nursing home staff failing to provide water or food to a resident for several days.""  As you can see these aren\'t exactly easy things to just claim.']"

It is typically regarded as a personal decision, and I‚Äôve never had anyone accuse me of wrongdoing because of it.  The greatest freedom is that *it is his personal choice* not to use any forms or birth control. You do not have to follow the same logic, and there is no reason to condemn you for believing differently.

(I won‚Äôt get in to the differences between premarital, marital, and extramarital sex, because it is not the point of the current discussion.)

Nothing about contraception, nothing about family planning, just that. The county I lived in at the time had the highest teen pregnancy rate in the state.  Now Virginia.

We were told what was actually in ejaculate and how it worked, and why it isn‚Äôt just sperm. We learned about different forms of contraception, and STIs and how to avoid them or get checked for them. The county I lived in there was on the low end of teen pregnancies.

Okay maybe I‚Äôm not understanding that part of your response but wouldn‚Äôt educating young people on these things increase the degree to which they could realize all those aspects?

But having babies is sufficient and necessary condition to be the goal of the nuptial act.  The magisterium has made multiple corrections to bishops who have had more liberal or progressive doctrine in terms of sexual liberation within the faith.   There is quite a lot of it here;  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_theology_of_sexuality  but notice how procreative nature is always highlighted and repeated, because it is the undisputed core of their doctrine.', 'I have 0 idea who that guy is, but the pope disagrees with him.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church    The unitive principle, jooning of hisband and wife has gained more protagonism in the past century. First being rescued by the pope in 1917, and every iteration since the Second Vatican council adding more flowery language around it, but the procrrative nature is always highlighted, in every single papal letter.  The latest of the subject is    less account than the obvious primary function which is procreation.  Most menopause sex is largely ignored but discouraged as per doctrine. The only sex allowed outside of procreation is natural family planning, aka you talk to your priest and he lets you (after making your case to him) try to have sex outside of ovulation cycles to reduce the chance of pregnancy.  This was only allowed after bad births, or if women were ‚Äúhysteric‚Äù after a miscarriage but since the 70s the church is way more lenient in allowing ‚Äúnatural family planning‚Äù which still considering pulling out entirely sinful. You can count her period days to reduce your chances but you better finish inside says the church  Edit:  also in general never trust an american catholic, much less one that quotes tbe bible instead of the pope. Most catholic doctrine comes directly from one of the Cathecisms from the 2nd Vatican Council, anyone referencing anything much older than that is prob out of date with current dogma', ' its in the same cathecism if im not mistaken, it was also relevant on the conversations of Francis in south east asia.  Edit: found it   See the explicit reference to marriage groups, and pastors. It is not something families ought to decide by themselves as the attempt to deny the procreative aspect is sinful.    if your priest allows it.   The only text I found supporting explicitly sex post menopause mentions women who believe in the miracle of St Elizabeth, if they do not and had a pap exam and are infertile then the official position is that you are defing the main purpose of nuptial act. There is also a popal text from 1930, which endorses the rhythm method and post menopause sex but that has been clarified multiple times since and is no longer the official recommendation (although its still allowed).  So if you trully believe that you can harbour a miracle some catholics seem to believe it does not count. But due to it being considered a contraceptive (infertility by menopause) it would fall under the last exception of the paragraph you shared on your last message.  As it being effectively an act that renders the procreation impossible it would be sinful.   Also found this piece on a family council   https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_12021997_vademecum_en.html   it is pretty explicit in its position about unfruitful marital acts.    I found it interesting how english sources seemed more open to the idea that the ones in my native langauge so I did some digging. You can read further into why American theologians disagree with the Vatican in many of this points due to a non approved study that American catholics embraced in the 70s, is on the Dissent area.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_theology_of_sexuality  My main language is not english so I did find more sources with similar points as the ones you were making, so I investigated further into why the anglosphere seemed to go against all italian, spanish and latin texts. And the wikipedia article had a nice summary. But yeah I think the official position is clear, natural family planning can be done with approval from your pastor or priest. Else sex should have the aim of procreation to fulfill its covenant with god']

Most of my concern is just with the tiny, but unacceptable risk that U.S. actions spark a strategic nuclear exchange and decimate life on earth.   Frankly, if this episode concludes in some way other than some mass casualty event or larger/world War,  I will be so happy; even though everybody will have reinforced their idea that provoking nuclear armed madmen is still the best way to deal with bullies on the global stage and it can never go horribly, irreversibly, wrong.  That's why I try to bring people's minds back around to the u.s. and western governments on this subject and not just screech putin bad with all the other apes:  I can't do anything about Putin, and nearly all the forces in the world right now are already combining against him.

Believing that MAD is still relevant shows me how stuck in the past you are.   The US has warned of direct attacks on Putin and Russia in the event of nuclear attacks. Responding to a nuclear attack from Russia is not starting shit. Maybe you should spend a bit more time reading into what‚Äôs actually happening in Ukraine/ the Allied military command.

In reality, Russia probably has a few dozen nukes that work, an untold number of missiles that could, potentially, get them to an intercontinental target. And I can *assure* you, we know where their nuclear submarines are, and do a regular count and track on them. We even patrol their own ""secret"" routes.

It‚Äôs like saying passing Go in Monopoly and getting $200 is a loophole because most squares don‚Äôt give you money.  SUPER LONG LINK AND TLDR AHEAD! YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN WARNED!!  This is a story with link about a massive loophole. Obviously don‚Äôt don‚Äôt do it, but from a technical standpoint is pretty funny:   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  ""The Zone of Death"" (or the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park). Another loophole may exist because of the combination of the Venue Clause in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, which reads ""The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed"" and the Vicinage Clause in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which reads: ""In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . .""  In 2005, Brian Kalt, a professor at Michigan State University, published an article ""The Perfect Crime"" describing how no crimes committed in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park would be constitutionally prosecutable because of these constitutional clauses. An excerpt from Prof. Kalt\'s article is below: ""Say that you are in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone, and you decide to spice up your vacation by going on a crime spree. You make some moonshine, you poach some wildlife, you strangle some people and steal their picnic baskets. You are arrested, arraigned in the park, and bound over for trial in Cheyenne, Wyoming before a jury drawn from the Cheyenne area. But Article III, Section 2 plainly requires that the trial be held in Idaho, the state in which the crime was committed. Perhaps if you fuss convincingly enough about it, the case would be sent to Idaho. But the Sixth Amendment then requires that the jury be from the state (Idaho) and the district (Wyoming) in which the crime was committed. In other words, the jury would have to be drawn from the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park, which, according to the 2000 Census, has a population of precisely zero.""  Thus, there would be no eligible jury that could convict you for the serious crimes that you have committed, and you could not be constitutionally prosecuted for crimes committed in the approximately 50 square miles of Yellowstone National Park located in Idaho.

The belief systems actually differ because they started with the idea that a mind can explain all of the mysteries behind physics and then they independently gave these gods different attributes and they independently decided what these gods want, how many gods exist, and what, if anything, happens after we die in the sense of an afterlife.  Creationists, especially YECs, worship the Bible like the Bible is itself God but most of them are appalled by the idea that their God could actually be wrong.

As far as whether *Buckley* was wrongly decided, you seem to argue against yourself with your ""me or Bill Gates"" example. If you think expenditure limits matter because Bill Gates can ""afford"" more speech than you, then the central reasoning underpinning *Buckley*, that limiting expenditures limits speech, is correct. And at that point you\'re basically arguing to limit some people\'s speech because you don\'t like that they can speak more than you.  I don\'t *like* the idea that some people can conduct more speech than I can, but the idea that somebody else\'s speech should be restricted because they have more time/money/resources than I do is terrible to me.  And if we\'re going for an ""everybody has the exact same amount of speech they can use"" approach, then every person in the US needs to be subject to Hatch Act restrictions, because government employees are *significantly* restricted in what they can and can\'t do, politically, and it wouldn\'t be ""fair"" for some people to have more speech than others, would it?', ""It's about both.  For-profit enterprises shouldn't have free speech rights and especially not rights to attempt to influence the government directly.  It gives direct perverse incentives when profit-seeking and governmental manipulation coexist within the same place and directly breeds corruption.  Money should at minimum flow to individuals via wages, dividends, or whatever before it can be used as a political device. Because people have rights inherently and are where actual freedoms reside. Corporations, like I said before, are tools and should not be imbued with powers beyond what is strictly necessary.  From there, the government has a very compelling interest in limiting the influence of money in politics because unlimited money in politics also breeds corruption. To that end, Buckley v. Valeo was wrongly decided, and CU with it. Reasonable personal and collective limits in political monetary expenditure should be upheld and enforced because of equal protection. It is farcical to suggest that the government can equally protect and serve myself and Bill Gates when he can lobby for something with the force of multiple lifetimes of my work without so much as noticing a significant hit to his pocketbook while i am limited to small fractions of my lifetime of work at any given time."", 'No, the other person is trying to be overly pedantic and also quoting me out of context to pretend like my problem isn\'t CU.  CU as I pointed out, is fruit of the poisonous tree where in the name of protecting free speech, any amount of money used ostensibly for ""free speech"" is allowed. This leads to ever increasing amounts of money being spent on buying elections and therefore corruption gains purchase left and right.  CU was a bad decision, predicated on a bad decision in Buckley v. Valeo. Justice White\'s dissent was prescient in pointing out the issues the decision would cause and the havoc and exclusion it bred.  CU is a problem. Buckley is a problem. Hobby Lobby is a problem.  It\'s all part of the same problem that has corrupting and disastrous effects on this country. Money shouldn\'t be mixed with rights.

You don't really have an advisor, so you take a couple guesses or buy into one of their index funds. Depending on the day or week, you might be up pennies or down dollars. If your car breaks down or you get sick, it takes you days to get your hands on the money you've invested. When you look back over the course of an entire year of putting in $10/week, you see that your $520 in deposits is now worth a whopping $550 *if* you didn't make any bad guesses.   These sentiments are generally aimed at people in their late 20s/early 30s, so I got some numbers. In 2021, the median income for individual 25 year olds is $36000. It's $52,776 for 35 year olds. [source](https://dqydj.com/average-median-top-income-by-age-percentiles/)  The average American renter pays [$1326 per month](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/average-rent-by-state).  The average American house will cost you almost [$360,000](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/102001/united-states/).   So here we have *median* earners (half of all earners make less) bringing in less than $1000/wk gross, or about $750 take home. Almost half of that goes straight to rent for a *median* apartment. If our median person in a median apartment wants to buy a median house, they'll need to save up $11000 for a down payment of 3%. At $200/month saved, it'll take almost 5 years to put that together, but home values are rising at 12% and so are rents, while incomes are only rising at 3-5% per year.   If our median earner lives in a cheaper apartment and buys a cheaper house, then lower earners will lose the opportunity to rent or buy those same properties.""]"

In the biggest cities of my country (Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, Salvador etc) there‚Äôs a constant war between police and factions of drug-dealers. In the times of the dictatorship it didn‚Äôt happen. The left-wing politicians say all the time that there was persecution for anyone that didn‚Äôt agree with the military party, all lies and more lies to manipulate the populace. The government did persecute people (I don‚Äôt support it), but they did so only with criminals, which is the case for our ex-president Dilma Rousseff and our future president Lula. The great media tells everyone that Bolsonaro is the wrong one, probably if you already heard something about this election you might think Bolsonaro is a monster. And also there was electoral fraud (another thing democracy is subjected to), because the president of the Superior Electoral Court is Lula‚Äôs friend and actually he has more power that every other politician here. He is *de facto* a dictator. All Lula‚Äôs friends around Latin America destroyed their countries with kleptocratic and socialist ideals. Look at Argentina‚Äôs inflation, Chile‚Äôs constitutional crisis, Pedro Castillo‚Äôs impeachment, the Venezuelan crisis and Nicaraguan persecution of christians. That‚Äôs why I prefer a authoritarian government (not a dictatorship though), people in these countries can‚Äôt make decisions as they are easily manipulated. In Europe (mostly Western) and North America education is better, thus most people can have their own opinion and are more difficult to be manipulated. I prefer an authoritarian government in less developed countries because of that, I just want to feel safe walking on the streets of my city and know that my taxes are being used to develop my country and not to go to the politicians‚Äô Swiss bank accounts.', 'Well, Lula really didn\'t leave the government because of corruption (the scandal was a long time after he left the presidency, and it was time for Temer *who entered after Dilma\'s impeachment*), and I really think that Lula was never a real saint , but unlike Bolsonaro, he thinks about the poor, thinks about their future (during his governments, my parents managed to study and have a much better life than they do now *we lived in the same house during the Lula government*), since he himself was a poor person. Bolsonaro really never cared about poverty (which increased in his government, but he uses the fact that the pandemic ""did that""). If Lula really stole, we cannot deny that Bolsonaro would have done the same (cough cough, 100-year secrecy of his children, his wife and him *but squid can remove the secrecy*). And after all that, he cut all university and research funding, and that\'s really sad (since a lot of research will have to stop) and the water trucks in the northeast are no longer used (it\'s like Bolsonaro\'s punishment for them, since almost all Lula\'s votes came from there). I\'m glad that at least next year (7 days) Lula will have his possession and this will all be over :) (ps: Bolsonaristas will mourn even more, and it will be funny to see them cry on twitter and Facebook lol)']"
