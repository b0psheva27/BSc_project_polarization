It's actually lower than I'd have pegged it if you think about home-owners in New York, San Fran, LA, Miami, and so on.  This is actually one of the great annoyances I have with this discussion.  You get talking head pieces like this that say look how many millionaires there are or how big the middle class is and I just go 'yeah, but if you're just going by net worth that includes houses.  People can have a net worth of 700k easy if they have a normal house in an expensive market and still be living paycheck to paycheck because they have no cash on hand.    Speaking as someone who was able to buy a house a few years back with my wife, it's an absolute game changer to not be dumping half your income down the rent money pit every month, but it doesn't actually mean you have money.  It's not like I'm going to sell my house just to free up funds.  I live there.  I need it.  It's where I keep all my stuff.  It's an incredible mental comfort to know my money isn't just being funneled to someone else's bank account and that assuming the housing market doesn't crash (or at least recovers) I can one day sell it for a profit, but it doesn't mean I'm actually loaded today."", '1.

Whether or not those laws are legal on the state level is for the courts to decide, but just like it's not illegal for a senator or congressman to propose something which is unconstitutional, it's also not illegal for the federal government to try and pressure States into enacting laws that are illegal in the state but would be arguably beneficial anyway.   Trump had been talking about the possibility of the Democrats illegally stealing the election from him ever since he did poorly in the 2018 midterms. Fear that he was going to try and do something illegal was absolutely precedented and reasonable because the man has shown on numerous occasions that any and all institutions of this country mean nothing to him so long as he can get more power, evident again by the fact that he literally said he wanted to overturn the Constitution and be installed as dictator.   No it isn't, Twitter has not revealed anything which even comes close to legitimizing your dominion voting machine bs. All its revealed is that there is an incredibly unhealthy and detrimental relationship between mass media institutions and the government, something which has been true and evident since mass media came into existence and is not in any way unique to this election whatsoever nor did it uniquely affect this election whatsoever. It isn't still in debate, you're just full of shit and the fact that you and people like you can be convinced of something this insane is honestly one of the greatest threats to the United States today. After all if you can be convinced of this then you can frankly be convinced of anything by anyone with an R next to their name.   Not true at all. Practically all crime happens predominantly in cities because that's where you just have the most people squished the most closely together. Of course there's going to be more crime when you have a hundred people in a room rather than five. That doesn't imply anything about the political leanings of the criminals, but what does imply something about the political leanings of the criminals was the degree to which right-wing pundits such as those on Fox News and even Donald Trump himself went out of his way to convince people that it was a bio-weapon that was developed and released specifically to attack the United States.   You are being extremely over-dramatic, all questioning wasn't banned. People who were very prominently spreading the worst and most extreme and unfounded of conspiracy theories were deprioritized in the algorithm, and everyone else had a little notation put under their post explaining to readers why the post is wrong.

Both Hindu and Greco-Roman paganism descend from indo European paganism since Indians and Greeks and Romans share common ancestry.   Hinduism is the closest we have to an uninterrupted version of extant Greco-Roman paganism. It's not a descendant but a cousin.  It's like how if you want to understand mammoths, you might have examine an elephant even though modern elephants did not descend from mammoths. They are related, and not direct descendants. Still of interest if you're interested in the extinct thing.  Also, the indo Europeans did not come from Europe proper. They came from the Caucasus and migrated to various places.     Finally, Indus river civilization, the first one in the Indian subcontinent was not 10k years ago. More like 5-6. These people did not practice modern Hinduism. Modern Hinduism is a confluence of indo European paganism and the existing pagan religions of India at the time of indo European migrations. There's actually large difference in Hindu practice based on geography. The northerners (more likely to be indo European in ancestry) are different from the southerners (who are the 'indigenous' driven south by the indo European invasion)  Anyway, you can read about this on the internet. No need to quiz some guy on Reddit.  https://tied.verbix.com/archive/article15.html"", ""Hindu religion is just indo European paganism. There are direct analogs between the Roman Greek deities and the Hindu ones and Hitler was a bit obsessed with paganism in general, just like white supremacists today. It's actually not at all surprising. Even things like the caste system were the norm in the west until paganism ended.  Fun fact... Hindu names of days are named exactly in the same sequence as in Latin.  For example, in Latin languages like French, Wednesday is mercredi... Mercury's day. In Hindi, Wednesday is Budhavar, where Budha is the Hindu name of mercury the planet and mercury/Hermes the god. Budha is the son of father Brihaspati, which is the Hindu name of Jupiter the planet as well as the sky god. Hinduism then collected random other gods along the way, but the core indo European matrix is there.  Like Zeus and Jupiter, Brihaspati  is the teacher /guru of the lesser gods.  There are some disconnects. For the example, the word Jupiter comes from indo European Dyeus pitar, which is actually a separate Hindu god (named Dyauspitar) not associated with Thursday. He's most equivalent to chronos or Uranus.  Anyway, the point is that anyone interested in European paganism would naturally look eastward to India, since there are no European pagans anymore and the closest extant religion that shares an unbroken line to Greek and roman paganism is Hinduism.."", 'Yes of course! As Paul says when sin increased grace increased all the more and Paul should know. He called himself ""chief of sinners"" because of the time he spent hunting and murdering Christians.  The problem is that twisting scripture in small ways can lead to disastrous outcomes. This exact thing has happened with many scriptures. Where this conversation was going was ""well we\'re all sinners so does [this] sin even matter?"" Views that make light of sin always lead to sin .It\'s been the same discussion for almost 2 thousand years now. ""Well wouldn\'t more sin mean more grace?"" Paul responds to this in Romans 6.  What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 2 By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 3 Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.  Notice the exclamation mark after by no means. It\'s not very common in scripture. The words are very strong in the greek.   Anyone who would wish to be a Christian must understand the danger of sin and choose a life of fighting to be free of it by the spirit. Scripture tells us that those who take sin lightly either don\'t understand the high price that was paid for redemption or don\'t appreciate it anyway (hebrews 10:29) and will lose the grace given to them. Christ paid a high price with his own blood and suffering. The word excruciating was created to describe the unimaginable pain of literally tearing your body apart as you fight to take a breath (the cross actually kills by asphyxiation). He gave everything to put an end to sin. He expects people to respect the gravity of the situation   But yes all sin can be redeemed but twisting scripture to make certain sins look less dangerous only leads to dangerous places. If you want to know more the Book of 1 John that was half about this subject to address a similar lie that was putting greek believers in danger. Basically greeks had found a round about way of saying that if you sin it\'s really just you\'re body doing it and your not guilty of anything. Again they\'re believing that sin was in some way ""no biggie"" they were putting themselves in danger.']"

Better to say that I am flexible on exactly two things (as I have acknowledged, repeatedly): a) What constitutes consent to use of the body. b) When and if that consent is binding.  I started off with a maximalist position on b) in that this isn\'t a mortgage and consent can be withdrawn for any time and any reason, but was *persuaded* to reconsider.  Though, if we\'re going to complain about shifting positions, you said you only objected to the issue in case of consensual sex and then immediately started going after rape as well, so I\'m very tempted to write that concession off as bad faith and say that if they ever invent reversible organ donations, *never piss off your kidney donor for the rest of your natural life*.   Wow, really cool of you to clip out the part where I do, not, in fact, take that back.   Well of course the fetus needs be alive, otherwise it\'s a fucking miscarriage now isn\'t it? Surely if the fetus *wasn\'t* alive you wouldn\'t argue that she should still carry it, would you? Like, I sincerely don\'t get why you keep saying ""so you\'re saying x needs to be *alive*"" like it\'s some kind of dunk -- if all of the participants in this drama *weren\'t* alive there\'d be nothing at all to discuss.   And if I forcibly evicted you and made you move to a big city against your will, or put a gun to your head and made you drive me somewhere, you would say I\'m being monstrously evil, *right*?   It seems like arguments of more than a few words at a time are hard for you to follow, yes. I\'ll try again. Bodily autonomy takes precedence over life. Bodily autonomy takes precedence over life even if it kills the other person. If you can restore bodily autonomy without killing the person, that\'s nice. But only if you can, in fact, restore bodily autonomy.    I\'m old enough to watch the ""mainstream leftwing argument"" fail miserably, because it *doesn\'t* make sense.  If you define ""life"" as ""consciousness"", then some irritating pedant is going to ask if it\'s okay for me to kill you in your sleep. If you say, no, that\'s insane, then they ask how long Grandma *does* have to be in a coma before she\'s legally a corpse and we inherit her fortune. Either way, you\'ll either find yourself being ""inconsistent"" on the definition of life or you\'ll give up and ban abortion.  Now, if you\'re going to define life as ""viability"" and ""viability"" as ""ability to live independently of another human"", then... I guess we\'ve been violently agreeing with each other, except that you seem to want to say the unviable fetus is not ""alive"" and I think it is but that that\'s irrelevant.   So, based on what you responded to, ""You can\'t ignore the argument about life"" means I *can* ignore the argument about life until I have completely exhausted the argument about bodily autonomy, and only consider life if I\'m satisfied that it will have absolutely no bearing on that autonomy.  You\'re right, that *was* hard to parse, almost as if you were desperately trying to twist your statement into meaning something completely opposite so you could say ""you were wrong"" and declare victory. Okay, champ. You win. I sure can\'t ignore life. Sweet dreams.', ' It was brought up because those are much better at preventing unwanted pregnancies, if you are truly in favor of those it\'s odd of you to ignore those points since widespread sex education and easy access to contraceptives drastically reduce abortions, especially compared to your idea of just telling people not to have sex. The points still stand in general though, since conservatives are largely against sex education and easy access to contraceptives.   The overwhelming majority of anti-abortion people are religious, the entire movement is founded by modern religious groups. Once they die out, so will their ""cause"".   It\'s not alive, it\'s not the same as killing a baby that\'s alive. It seems like you\'re aiming for a ""gotcha"" here by pointing out that you can be charged with murder for causing the unwanted termination of a fetus, but that does not conflict with abortion. Abortion is the choice of the woman carrying the baby, kicking a pregnant woman is not the woman\'s choice, and that\'s why there is a law against it. That same law even has a provision explicitly stating that it does not apply when a woman consents to have an abortion.', ' All women are marginalized in a forced birth society, and women who would have been alive aside from abortion bans are killed BY YOU.  Just because sometimes people die naturally does not make killing women okay. Would you accept it if I told you that abortion is perfectly fine because sometimes fetuses die?   FORCED pregnancy is not okay.   FORCED pregnancy is not okay. FORCED pregnancy is rape. You seek to rape and kill women through FORCED pregnancy.   Some people may have a heart attack naturally but it\'s not okay to deliberately give someone a heart attack.  Some people may die naturally but it\'s not okay to kill them.

Do you beat your wife to a pulp every night? Do you go around raping every woman you see? Why not? it\'s not killing us. Praise modern medicine! Amirite?   ANd when you FORCE a woman to stay pregnant and give birth, she is neither choosing to stay pregnant or accepting that risk. If she dies, YOU KILLED HER.   And you\'re perfectly fine with killing us in forced childbirth. You are pro-killing-women. Just say it. Just say that you want us dead.   It is if you\'re KILLING SOMEONE THROUGH FORCED BIRTH. If they could have gotten an abortion and didn\'t because of PL laws, PLERS KILLED HER. YOU KILLED HER.  Admit you\'re in favor of women dying to ""save babies."" Just say it. Say you\'re not in favor of protecting ALL life because you want women dead.   Allowing abortions allows women to get abortions and avoid childbirth. Abortion is far far safer than childbirth, and allowing every woman who wants an abortion to get one ensures that nobody is FORCED to risk death.   You don\'t, because they don\'t work. Women still die and you are fine with it. You say ""some women die, and it\'s tragic,"" and shrug and walk away. You rationalize it by saying it\'s perfectly fine to visit any level of violence on a woman you want--you may rape us, beat us, maim us, brutalize us--as long as you don\'t *kill* us. PRAISE MODERN MEDICINE. Amirite?   YOU ARE MURDEROUS. You want to hurt women, you want to commit violence against women, and you want to kill women. Just admit it. Just say that ""life exceptions"" means putting women in the ground, and you are fine with that. Just say that you are happy to visit ANY level of violence against a woman as long as it doesn\'t kill us, but also you\'re perfectly fine with killing us.  ""Women just die,"" you say. ""Our deaths are tragic but THINK OF THE BABIES,"" you say. ""I\'m fine with you dying,"" you say. Just admit it. Just own it. You\'re just as much of a murderer as you think I am.

HIV- A Virus Like No Other. http://theperthgroup.com/HIV/TPGVirusLikeNoOther.pdf  IS HIV THE CAUSE OF AIDS? An interview with Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos By Christine Johnson Continuum Autumn 1997 http://virusmyth.com/aids/hiv/cjinterviewep.htm  **Robert Gallo is a fraud** https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html  Dr. Peter Duesberg states:  “For them to justify their existence and their expenses, and make their careers they have to find infectious diseases.”  “The more diseases that they could lump into this AIDS syndrome, ‘S’ stands for Syndrome, the better the chances are they get patients under that umbrella. The more patients they could catch.”  **PCR inventor Kary Mullis writes:**   “In 1988 I was working as a consultant at Specialty Labs in Santa Monica, CA, setting up analytic routines for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). **I knew a lot about setting up analytic routines for anything with nucleic acids in it because I invented the Polymerase Chain Reaction. That\'s why they hired me.**     Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), on the other hand, was something I did not know a lot about. Thus, when **I found myself writing a report on our progress and goals for the project, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, I recognized that I did not know the scientific reference to support a statement I had just written: ""HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.""**     **So I turned to the virologist at the next desk, a reliable and competent fellow, and asked him for the reference. He said I didn\'t need one.** I disagreed. While it\'s true that certain scientific discoveries or techniques are so well established that their sources are no longer referenced in the contemporary literature, that didn\'t seem to be the case with the HIV/AIDS connection. **It was totally remarkable to me that the individual who had discovered the cause of a deadly and as-yet-uncured disease would not be continually referenced in the scientific papers until that disease was cured and forgotten.** But as I would soon learn, the name of that individual - who would surely be Nobel material - was on the tip of no one\'s tongue.”   “After ten or fifteen meetings over a couple years, I was getting pretty upset when no one could cite the reference. I didn\'t like the ugly conclusion that was forming in my mind: The entire campaign against a disease increasingly regarded as a twentieth century Black Plague was based on a hypothesis whose origins no one could recall. That defied both scientific and common sense.     **Finally, I had an opportunity to question one of the giants in HIV and AIDS research, DL Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute,** when he gave a talk in San Diego. It would be the last time I would be able to ask my little question without showing anger, and I figured Montagnier would know the answer. So I asked him.     **With a look of condescending puzzlement, Montagnier said, ""Why don\'t you quote the report from the Centers for Disease Control? ""**     **I replied, ""It doesn\'t really address the issue of whether or not HIV is the probable cause of AIDS, does it?""**     **”No,"" he admitted, no doubt wondering when I would just go away.** He looked for support to the little circle of people around him, but they were all awaiting a more definitive response, like I was.     **”Why don\'t you quote the work on SIV [Simian Immunodeficiency Virus]?"" the good doctor offered.**     **”I read that too, DL Montagnier,"" I responded. ""What happened to those monkeys didn\'t remind me of AIDS. Besides, that paper was just published only a couple of months ago. I\'m looking for the original paper where somebody showed that HIV caused AIDS.**     This time, DL **Montagnier\'s response was to walk quickly away to greet an acquaintance across the room.”**     “We have not been able to discover any good reasons why most of the people on earth believe that AIDS is a disease caused by a virus called HIV. There is simply no scientific evidence demonstrating that this is true.     We have also not been able to discover why doctors prescribe a toxic drug called AZT (Zidovudine) to people who have no other complaint other than the fact that they have the presence of antibodies to HIV in their blood. In fact, we cannot understand why humans would take this drug for any reason.”  http://www.duesberg.com/viewpoints/kintro.html', 'That you could get covid even if you were vaccinated.', ' Except they didn\'t, this is a (probably deliberately) inaccurate retelling of what they said based on what was at the time obvious right wing fear mongering. Vaccines aren\'t magic, they aren\'t a 100% effective super-shield, and no one actually made those claims. What *was* claimed is that they significantly reduced your chance of catching the virus, their effectiveness scales with adoption rate, and if you *did* get sick while vaccinated, your symptoms would likely be much more manageable, less deadly, and much less likely to result in hospitalization. When some conservative then gets sick and cries, ""they said I\'d be immune!"" it does not mean that ""they"" ever actually claimed you\'d be immune.  There\'s also the conflation about variants. The initial vaccine was very good at preventing you from catching the original variant of COVID, but not at preventing you from catching later variants, though it still helps with symptoms. Ignoring this as information regarding new variants continues to come out is at best willfully ignorant, and more likely just dishonest.   According to the data, that is very improbable. Not impossible, but unlikely, and at best anecdotal. Reported instances of heart conditions (misophonia) are incredibly low relative to the number of vaccines administered. When I looked up the actual numbers when someone was trying to argue this ""vaccines are dangerous"" point to me, the numbers _they gave me_ from the CDC website came out to about a 0.00004% chance of heart related issues following a vaccine dose. And that\'s not deaths, that\'s just literally any instance of misophonia, fatal or not.   1: it\'s not healthy skepticism; you\'re repeating long debunked claims, obvious misinformation, and have a clear misunderstanding of many relevant facts (like the basic fact that vaccine effectiveness differs between variants).  2: no one called you a fascist, you\'re just playing victim, lol.   No one has an issue with non-partisan research into any duration of side effects. That\'s literally just research. Calling it a ""legal investigation"" is very sus though, because that already implies it is not non-partisan at all, and implies it has little to do with any actual science. Calling it a ""legal"" investigation into mRNA technology as well is pretty sus - conservatives like to pretend that mRNA tech is something scientists just made up and shoved out in 2020 just for COVID, but the mRNA distribution of vaccines has been under development and being researched since the 90\'s. This is not actually a new technology like you\'ve been misled to believe.']"

Believe it or not, when the first gulf war happened, that\'s where people went to get the most up-to-date news. I could imagine an alternate reality where people went towards live chat instead of social networks, and in such an alternate reality, IRC may have kept up with the times.  But that\'s besides the point, since IRC was a more jocular answer (I do use it quite a lot though, even today).    You are inflating the importance of twitter though.  It does provide a lot of up-to-date information, but that same information can be spread through (and here I\'m giving more sensible answers than IRC lol) the news, radio, local twitter-like websites, facebook, etc.  Disasters happened before twitter, and things were fine.  What twitter added was millions of morons adding their own opinions and misinformation to the mix.  Sometimes they may say true things.  But the ""boston bomber"" affair wasn\'t a reddit only thing.  Very often they go on witchhunts with bad or misleading information.']"

On Feb. 23, hours before the invasion began, Sandworm took another swing, launching malware that infected several hundred Ukrainian government computers, officials said. The intrusion was detected quickly, the damage contained.  Then Sandworm struck again. But the code it used looked like it had been thrown together at the last minute, with programming errors — another fail.  Sandworm wasn’t done. In its boldest stroke yet, it went after the Ukrainian military’s satellite communications, used by soldiers in the field. It worked, and by 6:15 a.m. on Feb. 24, the system went down, right at Ukraine’s most vulnerable moment.  It could have been a crippling blow. But the Ukrainian government had a backup plan: a separate satellite communications system, which it had tested only two months before, to make sure it was ready in the event of a Russian invasion.    ...  Ukrainian law enforcement officials started noticing something else suspicious as well: a spike in foreign cellphone numbers near the border, in the forests between Ukraine and Belarus.  Russian soldiers were using cellphones to call home, and suddenly popping up on Ukrainian networks. Officials who monitor the traffic during peacetime for criminal activity quickly realized they could see and hear the invaders approaching in real time.  “We listened to the Russian soldiers as they panicked and called their friends and relatives,” said an official who oversees the phone intercepts. “They used ordinary phones to make decisions about their further moves.”  Down long corridors guarded by locks with facial detection, behind doors sealed with wax to detect intruders, teams of women tracked the Russian troops from small listening booths while their friends and relatives grabbed rifles to patrol the streets.  “We understood where the enemy was, what numbers they were using,” the official said.  The eavesdroppers passed the details to Ukraine’s armed forces to carry out ambushes and counterattacks. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, said Ukrainian forces used cellphone signals and even TikTok videos to target a unit of Chechen soldiers known as the Kadyrovtsy, named for the strongman leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.  It took 40 minutes from the time one video was uploaded to pinpoint the unit’s location near the Hostomel airport northwest of Kyiv, Mr. Budanov said. The Ukrainian military then hit them with three Tochka-U ballistic missiles, he said.  The Russians kept closing in on Kyiv, forcing the eavesdroppers tucked in listening rooms to make a quick decision: destroy their equipment and flee for their own safety, or hang on and continue gathering intelligence.  They stayed.  “We didn’t lose Ukraine. We didn’t let the enemy move further,” the official said. “On the first days, when they made foolish mistakes, we used their foolish mistakes to our advantage.”"", 'If El Paso had been embroiled in a separatist movement for 8 years yeah I really wouldn\'t have a problem with it, especially if not allowing El Paso to be independent meant the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives, massive damage to US infrastructure, and a decades spanning crippled economy. The Donbas and Eastern Ukraine has always been a contested area, even in the original elections those areas went to Ukraine by margins so narrow that in the US we would have held special elections for in many areas. Let\'s not pretend that these areas were the same as the rest of Ukraine, that Putin ever voiced interest in any area outside of these hotly contested areas, or that the people in these areas don\'t blame Ukraine for the war and not the Russians. You don\'t even have to read Russian sources, the financial times conducted interviews in Bakhmut and even the Ukrainian military in the area said that was a common sentiment in the area.   Let\'s also not forget that Zelensky ran on a platform of making peace with the Russians and ran on that platform but proceeded to do the opposite due to pressure from the West.   For the record I don\'t believe NATO troops are in Ukraine or that Ukraine is full of Nazis, I do believe that these areas of Ukraine have wanted independence for a long time, have fought for this independence for a long time, and that Ukraine doesn\'t really care all that much about these areas since they conducted shelling operations in these areas the day before the Russian invasion in violation of the Minsk accords. About dictators today that we support, Egypt? Saudi Arabia? Alegeria? Afghanistan (hardly a democracy, run by a warlord before that fell apart)? There are quite a few oppressive regimes and dictatorships we fund.  As for the Belt and Road initiative, how exactly is increasing a military budget going to help solve that? Are we going to start bombing countries for having Chinese funded infrastructure projects? It\'s not as though the Chinese government is sending its military to these places, they are using money and deals to gain and exercise power, and that\'s not something we can stop with guns and missiles. We can\'t just send soldiers to a country\'s port and say ""we own this now"", we\'d look like thugs because that\'s exactly what we would be.   Yes Russia is making friends in Iran and Syria. What the hell else do you expect them to do? We have cut them off from the rest of the world. We create enemies with our attempts at ""spreading democracy"" which is just code for ""we just want people in charge who we are friends with"" then cry and panic when it fails and other countries who we don\'t like make friends with the countries we made enemies out of. There is a reason why the Iranians don\'t like us and that\'s because we did a regime change in the 40\'s, the Syrians don\'t like us for the same reason.   Yes, as a NYC resident and native I\'m well aware of 9/11, but had our government exercised any competency it never would have happened, it was a preventable tragedy. All the whole war on terror, aka America\'s pissing contest with Islamofascists, did was make more people side with the Islamofascists because when your family is killed in a drone attack you lose all sympathy you may have had for some Americans that died in the WTC. Also, who was supporting the Taliban, Al-Queda, ISIS, and all these other groups before they attacked the US???? The US. WE CREATE OUR OWN PROBLEMS. The interventionism inevitably fails because we back losing causes, we increase resentment towards us, and our takeaway is that next time we should intervene harder. We are chasing the illusion that every country we dislike is like Nazi Germany and that if we win we can create a functional liberal democracy like we did there.   I think you overestimate Ukraine and misunderstand the Russian strategy, blitzing quickly may have been the original strategy but ever since April the new strategy has been the war of attrition, camp the positions, abandon areas that aren\'t defendable, and wait out Ukraine and it\'s working. Ukraine is running out of weapons, the new ones they are getting although more advanced cannot be maintained in the Ukraine and have to be sent to Germany for repairs (as the people who know how to fix them cannot be in Ukraine as the Russians would treat it as an act of war) and this will only further stress the already overworked supply lines into Ukraine. 100 billion dollars spent and can we really say that they caused 100 billion in damages to the Russian military or prevented 100 Billion dollars in damages to their own country? Most of Ukraine\'s energy grid is in the crapper, most are on the brink of starving or freezing this winter, is this what victory looks like? Was all this worth it?   I also think you overestimate effect of sanctions on Russia and underestimate the undeniably worse effect they have had on the West. Europe is going through an energy crisis, fertilizer increased in cost substantially, there are food shortages across the world. We have also permanently ensured that Russia will never rejoin the global financial system no matter who is in power because of the animosity we created by ceasing the assets of Russian civilians abroad. Now Russia and china are creating their own financial system which they will use with their new friends in the middle east to trade oil, which is a massive blow to the dollar.   I love America, I love the country, I love it\'s people, I love the constitution. What I don\'t love is our insane approach to foreign policy and our indifference towards the horrors of the wars we cause and escalate. If we stayed out of political conflicts in countries we don\'t understand and focused our efforts on development and improving our own country we wouldn\'t have these problems.']"

I was explaining the reason, not asserting whether it’s right or wrong. I already said that I shouldn’t have used the words “should be punished” but rather “are punished”. That’s what I had meant and I made it clear that I misspoke.   Nope. I’ve addressed it many times but I’ll address it again. It’s unethical because people shouldn’t be allowed to have dangerous killing machines that have caused mass murders and that they don’t need.   Nope again. I already explained how I misspoke and clarified myself in the first example (that’s not making anything up). Also, saying that unethical laws should be changed is not a new standard. It’s an existing standard. Look at laws through history up to now that have been reformed. Ask anyone with common sense.   Then go to a shooting range for target practice. No need to own guns in your home   Ask all the families of all the victims of the school shootings and gun massacres that have occurred in America. I can give you so many more examples of mass murders caused by guns than you can give me of “mass murders” caused by alcohol. Do people use guns or alcohol in war to cause damage? America is a laughing stock for other countries because of the amount of shootings that happen here, and the fact that people like you ignore the glaring evidence that guns are more harmful than they protect. The studies literally show that people like you have a “knowledge deficit” in the statistics regarding guns, which is why you live in denial. You can’t cause mass murder with alcohol, you can cause it with guns. And since you keep mentioning the Carrollton bus collision, I already said that we have laws against drunk driving to prevent that. No matter what laws you make, some people will violate those laws. But making the laws cuts down on the frequency of people doing harmful things.    1) No ones forcing you to go near a pitbull 2) There’s plenty of options to eat meat, so you don’t need elk, 3) go to a shooting range and borrow a gun. There are alternatives for all the uses of guns. So you don’t need one unless you want to hurt others.   Give me the statistics on how many grandmas absolutely needed a gun to protect themselves when they had things like knives, hammers, police, etc available   They did already existed. I only added them because you didn’t have the common sense to understand them already. Like the fact that guns are not sentient like people. Just cause I add something doesn’t mean that it didn’t already exist. If someone walks into a room, does that mean they didn’t exist before entering the room?   Lmaoooooooo, are you that desperate that you’re literally making something up that i never said 😂? And you’re the one accusing me of making stuff up.     Yes it did, and that’s why a lot of laws have been reformed lmao. Like laws to ban slavery and promote equal rights. So unless you want to deny history and what the majority of people will say, I’m not making anything up   I already explained multiple times how I misspoke in the first quote and if you’re so desperate to win that you keep ignoring that, that’s on you buddy.   Putting words in my mouth again I see. Give me the proof where I said that. I’m advocating for getting rid of guns, not people who own them, which can be enforced without hurting people.   Let me just jog my memory on how guns protect people. Oh wait that’s right. By hurting other people    Some explosives are illegal.    Like I said above, give me the statistics on how often that’s necessary   Yep and guns also increase homicides and mass murders, not just suicide. They are inherently dangerous. If alcohol was as dangerous as guns, then why can’t people use alcohol instead of guns in wars?   Is everclear the only type of alcohol that people consume?   I never said guns shouldn’t be used in war, I’ve been referring to domestic ownership. Also, since you own a gun, why don’t you go liberate Ukraine?', ' Nope, I’ve said countless times that if a law is unethical, it should be changed, because enforcing that law would also be unethical. Look at my previous comments if you don’t believe me.   Yep, I was comparing to the holocaust. If you think something like the holocaust happened in america for people violating gun laws, you are deluded.   There’s a lot of things I need to survive on a daily basis. So what you’re saying is objectively false.    Yep, I did. I said that wanting to kill people for fun with guns is sadistic and immoral. Not the same with alcohol. Seems like you lack the ability to pay attention.   Guns are killing machines, alcohol isn’t.   Guns are only used to hurt people. If you want to do target practice, you can use paintball guns. There’s no other need for actual guns.   It’s illegal to own a bomb because of the danger they pose to society. There.   Didn’t talk about the earth, I was talking about me. You lack reading comprehension skills it seems.   Nope, my standard was prohibiting things that are BOTH designed to be lethal/cause mass murders and not needed.   I’m not changing any standards. Protecting humans as sentient beings has been the standard in any ethical/legislative discussions. I just had to bring it up because it was clear that you lacked the critical thinking skills to realize the guns can’t be compared to humans or body parts.   Were you born with a gun attached to your body? That’s right, you weren’t.    Making guns illegal will drastically lower people’s ability to obtain and own guns. Will some people break the law? Sure. But then they’ll be punished. And again, eyeballs aren’t dangerous and they are a part of people’s bodies which they own. Guns aren’t    Not necessarily. Guns laws can be enforced by closing down stores that sell guns, imprisoning/fining people who guns, etc. No shooting involved in those scenarios. SWAT raids are only one option that are used when necessary    Again, I have mentioned it many times, but it’s not my fault if you don’t have reading comprehension skills. It’s not my responsibility to be punished for someone’s else’s actions.   I’ve said multiple times that alcohol isn’t killing anyone unless it’s abused. Guns are inherently killing machines. They are *only* used to hurt.   Again, I’ve said multiple times that alcohol in moderation has minimal health risks. Most people who drink alcohol will be fine. Anyone who uses a gun on people will hurt those people.    Then why do you need them? I already said you could go to a shooting range or use paintball guns for target practice. No need to own them.   Alcohol is not a killing machine and it’s not used to hurt others so it’s fine to trust people with it at home. Same doesn’t apply to guns   Guns are the machines through which people inflict mass murders. It seems like you lack basic common sense as well.   People   We also have laws to forbid people from driving drunk. Some people unfortunately break those laws, the same way that some people break any laws   Think again. I’ve never said anything of those things. I said countless times that laws could be unethical and if so, they should be changed. But gun laws aren’t. You haven’t given me one good reason why guns laws would be unethical that I wasn’t able to refute. I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve said that.    I just gave you two examples in this message. Owning explosives and driving drunk. Both are illegal because both are unsafe. Also, I don’t magically make up new standards. I bring up relevant ones that you ignore that cannot be applied to guns. Like for example, guns are not sentient beings like humans. So you can’t apply guns laws to humans.', ' I clarified what I meant there a long time ago because I clearly misspoke. I had said that in response to you saying that people violating gun laws are thrown into jail to reduce suicides. I responded by saying that they are thrown into jail because they violated a law. Go back to that comment if you don’t believe me. My mistake was using the word “should” instead of the word “are”. But I clarified my meaning. I also clarified that punishment for violating laws occurs because that’s how laws fundamentally work. If they didn’t, no one would follow any laws. After that, I also made it clear that if a law itself is unethical, it should be reformed because enforcing it would be unethical. Just because something is legal doesn’t mean it’s ethical. I didn’t make up any new standards. This is quite literally common sense and anyone with common sense would agree with me.    No, I brought up fundamental differences between guns and alcohol that makes your analogy invalid. In case you don’t know how analogies work, the comparison has to be valid 1) Alcohol is something that people consume for fun, and if used in moderation, it has minimal health risks. It isn’t normally used to hurt people and it doesn’t cause mass murder. The examples you brought up about the driving accidents are examples where alcohol is illegal: you can’t drive while drunk. 2) Guns are dangerous killing machines that have the ability to cause mass murders. I can give you a long list of examples of schools shootings and people using guns to mass murder people. They have no use unless you want to hurt people. If you want to do target practice, you can use paintball guns, other fake guns, or just go to a shooting range where you can use a gun for target practice. If you want to protect yourself, you can use knives, hammers, or any other household object.     I didn’t create any standards. Multiple standards already exist and I brought those into the discussion to refute the absurd claims you were making. For example, you said people should be killed because they aren’t needed like guns. And I said that people are sentient beings, not guns. This is an objective fact, not just some random standard I made up. Another example: where I said that if a law is unethical, it should be changed. Again, I didn’t make up a new standard. Ask anyone and they will agree with me. I again just brought it into the conversation to refute your claims. I didn’t just make it up.   It’s funny you are the one saying that, the person that compared getting rid of guns to getting rid of people (who are sentient living beings, not objects like guns) and the same person who compared enforcing gun laws to the holocaust (which is one of the biggest atrocities committed in history). I never once said that no person has been protected by a gun. I said that there are literal studies that prove that guns harm more than they protect. Saying ownership of explosives is illegal is not psychotic, it’s the law and for good reason. They are extremely dangerous. I also gave you many options that fulfill the same purpose as guns, so there’s no need to have guns.    Nope. Drunk driving is one scenario where alcohol is harmful and that’s why we have laws against it. Alcohol otherwise used in moderation has minimal health risks. Guns are inherently dangerous and lethal. I’ve given you alternatives for all the uses of guns, so there’s no need to own something so dangerous. What’s the alternative to drinking alcohol that would produce the same effect that causes people to enjoy alcohol?']

Is your evidence ""Somebody told me so""? Or ""none at all""?  I promise you that not one single climate scientist fails to understand the inappropriateness of using the EBT to predict Earth\'s ACTUAL temperature.  The EBT is primarily used as an educational tool, to try build towards a point where students could understand how to do a *correct* analysis of the temperature of a planet\' with an atmosphere.  The link I offered you is an example of a *correct* analysis of planetary temperature.  \\* \\* \\*   The blogger (not ""researcher"") you\'re quoting is [someone](https://phzoe.com/author/phzoe/) who studied and worked in *finance*, with *no known science education* at all.  As far as I can tell from reading her blogs, she\'s got some computer skills, but there is no evidence that she understands more than just enough physics to get herself into deep trouble.  If she shares the same misunderstandings as you, that doesn\'t make those misunderstandings true.', 'Basically, humans are dipping into fossil fuel reserves locked up underground by natural geologic processes of the carbon cycle and releasing carbon dioxide into the air. Carbon dioxide is a gas that traps heat (which is a greenhouse gas), so the more of it there is in the atmosphere, the warmer it gets. We keep on adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, so we are continuing to cause warming. However, it isn’t as simple as adding carbon dioxide directly increases warming. The addition of carbon dioxide and subsequent warming causes instabilities in other parts of the earth system, for example the salt concentration of ocean water. The warming causes melting of ice caps, which lessen the saltiness of sea water and disrupt ocean currents. As I mentioned before, the disruption of the Gulf Stream by the melting of Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice cap could disrupt the flow of the Gulf Stream to Europe, thereby plunging Europe into freezing temperatures as it is in a high latitude and is only kept mild by the warm Gulf Stream current. This is just one example, and the gist of it is that the addition of co2 to the atmosphere will cause a chain reaction of climate effects that will be entirely unpredictable. The only thing we can predict is the increase in atmospheric co2 concentrations, which will inevitably destabilize the climate. And the natural climate cycles never happen this quickly. Sure, we have the odd volcanic eruption that results in cooling, or increased solar activity that results in a little bit of warming, but we have seen an unprecedented increase in warming over the last 100 years, which directly correlates to the addition of co2 to the atmosphere by humans. Natural cycles do not cause change on such short scales, the processes that change the temperature/climate of earth either release co2 into the atmosphere (weathering of rock), or affect earths orbit/position (milankovitch cycles) operate on 1,000s to 100,000s of years. Meanwhile, this change has been occurring over little more than a century and directly parallels human consumption of fossil fuels, and is rising exponentially instead of at a steady rate. By the way, I learned a lot of this in my environmental science class but also through research.']"

If you cannot see the inherent bias in your media and the flaws in your leaders as well as the positives in the opposition then its safe to say you\'ve been compromised and your being influenced, if not outright manipulated. Again this is true for most people regardless of their political leanings.   The reason why this is so Cleary the case with Musk is because most people give the see vague reasons why they dislike him.  Truth is he\'s bizzare because he\'s a very unique individual,  a one off,.he\'s highly intelligent in certain areas but lacks social intelligence.  This is actually extremely common for people like him.  People  talk crap about him being some elitist billionaire or being a narcissist or megalomaniac. He\'s none of those things.... well he is definitely a billionaire but other than his jet which honestly is a necessity when you are a CEO of a larğge and rapidly expanding international company.

For a while he had a tiny home  that he\'d stay in at the space X launch pad but I\'ve heard many talk about him often sleeping on the factory floor so he can keep getting things done if it calls for it.  He\'s singlehandedly responsible for the wide adoption of Evs. Because the innovations they\'ve made have  lowers  costs significantly.  They make great products that people enjoy and that will last a long time. Not only that but each of their products has the potential to make its owner money.

They don\'t have them which is friggin insane, completely unheard of for any large corporate producer of any product.

All their ideas involve more regulations, less freedom for us,and more control for them. You\'ve got Gates preaching deportation and trying to get everyone to leave rural areas cand consolidate into major cities. Conveniently this will make people easier to control. But while he preaches that he\'s busy buying up as much farmland as he cN get his hands on. Gates is now the largest owner of farms in the country. This is a very bad thing.

Talk about power.1😬 Swab is preaching the great reset saying ""you\'ll own nothing but be happy "" All of their visions for our future are ones where all of us have to be OK with having significantly less while they get more. Musk on the other hand has a vision where things in the future are more decentralized so they give power to each individual rather than for him and his billionaire buddies Ike Gates and Schwab want.  Musk doesn\'t care about money or power. His motivation is one of impact. He wants to change the world in a significantly meaningful way.

Also, like, it's theoretically always affordable, and it's important to understand how the system works, it's arguably pretty fair.

So theoretically if someone leaves university and can't make much money they won't pay much at all, while the service is subsidised by high earners who got high-paying work from their degrees. Arguably it's a fairer system than funding from the taxpayer, if more complex.

Does it apologise for what other nations\' corporations did there? Apologise for what a foreign military demanded during WWII and the Cold War?

Blame ought to be shouldered by those who carried out atrocities and gave orders, and those atrocities should be named clearly. Just saying ""sorry about everything"" doesn\'t cut it. If you\'re going to apologise 60 years after the facts, at least put some effort into it.  Lumumba was murdered. Between 2 million and 10 million Congolese people lost their lives through genocide and disease under Leopold. A uranium mine possibly used slavery in the Belgian Congo. Hundreds of Congolese children were brought to Belgium when Mubutu was poised to seize power, then forgotten in the cracks of the orphanage system. Songa tribes were paid in weapons to enslave other tribes on behalf of the AIA, which directly resulted in the hand-cutting nightmare during the CFS days. These are all atrocities, and a blanket apology is simply not good enough. You say ""the fact that it took them so long to apologize for it really isn’t a good look."", but while I agree, I would argue that apologising for things they did not do is an even worse look. It makes them seem uncaring about the issue, and only caring about moral posturing. Words are not enough to me. Name and shame those who did it, if they can be found, even if that sheds a poor light on a lot of allied nations and will likely step on some important toes.', "" That's the thing though, for the first half and for the worst atrocities (genocide, hand cutting, etc), the Congo was not a colony. At all.  Belgium had nothing to do with the Congo Free State project, apart from its monarch being the (private) owner. The Belgian government actively opposed him owning it, and refused to lend him any monetary and military aid, he couldn't even use governmental buildings in Brussels for it.   Instead he successfully begged 14 other countries to finance it at the Berlin Conference. He founded the AIA for that purpose: get funding from foreign corporations and governments, hire their military and mercenaries, and set up a new private government for Congo only.   Though Belgium itself is not totally blameless either. In total there were an estimated 1.500 Belgians who were on board with the CFS project. The rest were mainly British, French, American, Prussian and Russian. Particularly British ex-military for the dirty work, as they had, to put it bluntly, experience with that sort of thing. And even that wasn't enough manpower to control an area 900x the size of Belgium, so the numerous Songa tribes were contracted too, willing to enslave other tribes. Like a group project of vileness.  Why all that effort? Two reasons. Politically these nations wanted a neutral territory in the heart of Africa at the end of the 19th century. While technically not at war with each other in their home countries, the colonies were a different thing. There were constant border skirmishes, raids, sabotage runs, anything to weaken the other Powers' resources. And that was costing everyone money. Belgium, being Europe's neutral power, was a perfect candidate for that neutral African role but had no interest in setting up a colony. But its king certainly did.   The second reason is similarly steeped in greed. Congo had some gold, diamonds, copper, but more importantly rubber (later on) and uranium (later still). Funding the greedy little king was a sure way to allow your corporations and mercenaries into the region and strip it bare of resources. Pure and utter selfishness on all parts.    I agree they were responsible for the atrocities in the Belgian Congo, which was the colony later on. After international outcry following Morel's writings, the Belgian government threatened to depose Leopold if he did not give up the CFS. Which he did, but no one wanted it, tainted internationally as it now was. Belgium itself took it, and it became the Belgian Congo. While the genocide and slavery ceased, there were still other atrocities committed as described in my previous comment. Lumumba was murdered by the Belgian government. Hundreds of kids were kidnapped. And it's possible the CIA's uranium mines still used slavery, though we'll likely never know; all evidence was destroyed and the mines were largely collapsed. I do blame the Belgian government somewhat for the uranium debacle, but I also understand that refusing the US military is... difficult. They needed uranium for the Manhattan project during WWII, and they sure got it. I partly blame the US for that particular one, the other two are 100% on Belgium.""]"

Quotes can be cherry picked so easily it’s just more irony of the situation considering your original call out was about taking Marx out of context.   Lenin has already said plenty about the counter arguments posed by Kautsky in the 2nd International regarding Marx’s commentary on the DOTP (which is where you’re getting this from whether you’re aware of it or not):  ”Let us point out, in passing, that when calling the non-Bolsheviks in Russia, i.e., the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, socialists, Kautsky was guided by their name, that is, by a word, and not by the actual place they occupy in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. What a wonderful understanding and application of Marxism!”  “The question of the dictatorship of the proletariat is a question of the relation of the proletarian state to the bourgeois state, of proletarian democracy to bourgeois democracy. One would think that this is as plain as a pikestaff. But Kautsky, like a schoolmaster who has become as dry as dust from quoting the same old textbooks on history, persistently turns his back on the twentieth century and his face to the eighteenth century, and for the hundredth time, in a number of paragraphs, in an incredibly tedious fashion chews the old cud over the relation of bourgeois democracy to absolutism and medievalism!”  “But this means he utterly fails to understand what is what! One cannot help smiling at Kautsky’s effort to make it appear that there are people who preach “contempt for democracy” (p. 11) and so forth. That is the sort of twaddle Kautsky uses to befog and confuse the issue, for he talks like the liberals, speaking of democracy in general, and not of *bourgeois democracy*[my italics]; he even avoids using this precise, class term, and, instead, tries to speak about “presocialist” democracy. This windbag devotes almost one-third of his pamphlet, twenty pages out of sixty-three, to this twaddle, which is so agreeable to the bourgeoisie, for it is tantamount to embellishing bourgeois democracy, and obscures the question of the proletarian revolution.”  This view” (which Kautsky dubs “contempt for democracy”) “rests upon a single word of Karl Marx’s”. This is what Kautsky literally says on page 20. And on page 60 the same thing is repeated even in the form that they (the Bolsheviks) “opportunely recalled the little word” (that is literally what he says—des Wörtchens!!) “about the dictatorship of the proletariat which Marx once used in 1875 in a letter”.  Here is Marx’s “little word"":   First of all, to call this classical reasoning of Marx’s, which sums up the whole of his revolutionary teaching, “a single word” and even “a little word,” is an insult to and complete renunciation of Marxism. It must not be forgotten that Kautsky knows Marx almost by heart, and, judging by all he has written, he has in his desk, or in his head, a number of pigeon-holes in which all that was ever written by Marx is most carefully filed so as to be ready at hand for quotation. Kautsky must know that both Marx and Engels, in their letters as well as in their published works, repeatedly spoke about the dictatorship of the proletariat, before and especially after the Paris Commune. Kautsky must know that the formula “dictatorship of the proletariat” is merely a more historically concrete and scientifically exact formulation of the proletariat’s task of “smashing” the bourgeois state machine, about which both Marx and Engels, in summing up the experience of the Revolution of 1848, and, still more so, of 1871, spoke for forty years, between 1852 and 1891.”   [All of this and plenty more can be found in the 1st chapter of Lenin’s *The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/common_liberal.htm)   I doubt you will read all of this much like you won’t read that book but I’m plenty read on the subject of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

They also have some options for automation that you really can't do without specific support for it, such as having the car pull out of a parking spot on its own, or cooling the cabin before you get back.  The reason you buy a luxury car is comfort, and the traditional mindset is that before adding a feature to a car it should be robust, reliable, and perfect. Tesla does not really play by those rules, so they provide tons of quality of life features through software updates, and I think it will be a while until competitors wise up to this and start presenting similar offerings. Until then, people who want Teslas and their features will likely be a capitive market, maybe a small and non-viable one eventually, but specs and reliability does not a good user experience make.

It describes a system of assimilation and indoctrination with beliefs which typically conflict with the individual’s lived experience (a personal experience the class in power cannot have) and therefore has nothing to do with “incorporate” or “internal.” It’s about the direction of an axis of oppression, not how the misogyny is felt or perceived.  The “Feminine Mystique,” the “patriarchal bargain,” and “internalized misogyny” are all terms used for similar but not fully analogous phenomena. However, unlike toxic masculinity, which can be reinforced by everyone including women, the former terms only apply to those oppressed under patriarchy (internalized misogyny, patriarchal bargain) or those who take on feminine roles (Feminine Mystique—which describes the oppressiveness of femininity). In particular, the Feminine Mystique is more radical than toxic masculinity as it challenges the very existence of gender roles.   Feminism is not equivalent to femininity or womanhood.   Your comments suggest you don’t understand what toxic masculinity actually is if you think “toxic feminism” would be its opposite.', 'But the entire point of the patriarchy and the inequality between men and women is that women have never defined what ""femininity"" meant, let alone masculinity. It has always been powerful men within the systems of control that have done that.  The toxic element is where masculinity is taken to a point that harms men and harms the people around them that is often signal boosted by the cultural systems in play. There just isn\'t really a straight up equivalent for women. There\'s internalized misogyny where women do harmful things because of patriarchal systems, but there\'s no matriarchal systems that push women into harmful thoughts and actions.  It\'d be like trying to say systematic racism in the US needs an equivalent for minorities. Well, the systems in place just never existed where minorities could define racism and enforce their will on others. Are some minority individuals self-hating, perpetuating racism for power or money, straight up mean spirited or cruel? Sure, there\'s internalized racism, but there isn\'t quite the same concept as systematic racism.

""On the other hand, in healthcare, women are more likely to be taken less seriously by healthcare workers, even if the nurse or doctor is also a woman""  Yeah feminists love to say this but there\'s no real evidence for it once you account for the fact that women are much more likely to complain and exaggerate their supposed ""suffering"". If it was truly an issue then women would have worse survival/recovery rates than men but they don\'t. There is no ""upper hand"" for men. It\'s just a classic example of a gender disparity and women immediately assuming ""misogyny"" is the reason.  If anything, doctors are LESS likely to feel sympathetic towards male patients.  ""The most well known if it’s downfall is women finally getting the right to vote, for example.""  Men got the vote a meager TEN freaking years before all women got the vote. The idea that this proves ""men had more say throughout history"" is highly asinine.  At the end of the day, men have less rights than women. They get less programs on their behalf. Basically every single institution, particularly academia, education, politics &amp; the media HEAVILY caters towards women, men do not get the same legal protections as women (men cannot be raped by women under federal law, men are more likely to be arrested for reporting their OWN domestic violence victimization at the hands of women due to the Duluth Model, which was implemented by feminists, etc etc).  By any ""systemic"" measurment, men have it a LOT worse. But despite all of that, people IN GENERAL have it very good now.

Appointed offices have lower interest rates- an empirical validation that appointing smart people and leaving them away from the whims of (dumb) voters produces better results.

The Japanese were not forcibly removed from Tokyo and forbidden from returning.   I believe that most countries after the Yugoslav wars allowed minorities to return. I know Croatia provided a pathway for return for Croatian Serbs, but it is bound in red tape, and many don\'t want to return anyway. However, they did provide a pathway as the UN demanded.  Israeli Jews were not innocent of terrorist incidents in that time either, so these incidents don\'t justify ethnic cleansing. Nothing justifies ethnic cleansing.  I\'m not asking Israelis to leave the land. That would be wrong. That would be ethnic cleansing. I\'m saying that ethnic cleansing is ethnic cleansing. There is no good ethnic cleansing. A permanent ban on returning Palestinians was wrong.  The ""nothing more is owed"" part is wrong. The Palestinians were ethnically cleansed. Ethnic cleansing is not an acceptable action. They are owed more than what they lost, they are owed compensation to be made as whole as possible in the event that a deal will not allow them to return to their homes.   That phrase- ""From the River to the Sea""- is a phrase where I give some people a pass for mixing up and using if they have shown that they don\'t want to expel Jews. I honestly think that Hamas chose an amazing slogan- one that clearly endorses genocide when used by them, but also gets spread to other people who don\'t realize that it originates as an anti-semitic slogan. If you don\'t know the context, it doesn\'t sound objectionable. It is honestly a really good encapsulation of how rhetoric on this entire conflict is completely fucked.  Also, you know who voted for Netanyahu\'s coalition, ensuring that there would be no two-state solution? Israelis. Whose coalition is responsible for illegal settlements? For the crimes that I\'ve listed on my comments above? Israel\'s hands aren\'t innocent either.', 'Well, while Palestinians refused the UN partition plan and attacked the Jewish Yishuv with the assistance of Arab countries and volunteers, at the end of 1948 they still had much of the land intended for them… except Egypt and Jordan occupied it for 19 years. Those countries held most of what was to be Palestine, denying Palestinian sovereignty, so they and the rest of the invading Arab armies should compensate them. Further Arab country belligerence caused the West Bank to be taken, so more reason for that responsibility.  As for the illegal settlements, the Palestinians are invited to have them. There’s no reason that while Israel is required to have large Arab Israeli minority, Palestine gets to insist on being free of Jews. They can enjoy a minority of far Right Jews as Palestinian citizens.  BTW, since you raised ‘Apartheid’, I’m curious if you’re aware that while Israel had an Arab minority since 1948, Jews were ethnically cleansed from Arab conquered territory at the same time? Jerusalem was cleared of Jews for the first time since Roman times. No Jews were allowed to remain in the West Bank where they had lived for centuries. Jews were barred from even praying in Jerusalem, for the first time since Roman times. So if anyone has a track record of total ethnic cleansing and Apartheid, it’s the Palestinians and Arab countries.', ' They should. But Israel should also pay for the lost real estate caused by not allowing Palestinians the right to return following the Nakba.   I have no issue with this, Israel can decide how to make these people whole.   I am aware of this, yes. I really fail to see what ""they ethnically cleansed us first"" is suppose to prove here.    &gt;So if anyone has a track record of total ethnic cleansing and Apartheid, it’s the Palestinians and Arab countries.   So does Israel, even if it wasn\'t *total* ethnic cleansing. I don\'t really see why ""Arabs did ethnic cleansing first"" means that Israel didn\'t do it too.   To be clear, when you say:   Are you saying that Israel does NOT have a history of ethnic cleansing and apartheid? Because that is how I\'m reading this sentence.  Israel forbid a large number of Palestinians who fled during the Nakba from returning. This was ethnic cleansing. Even if a large number of them fled for reasons other than being forced out by Israelis (fleeing fighting, fearing massacres (even if unfounded), advice from Arab leaders), refusing to allow them to return is ethnic cleansing.  Look at the laws that Israel applies to Palestinians and Jews, but not others. Israel doesn\'t allow naturalization for Palestinians in the West Bank or Gaza who marry an Israeli national. This is not a problem for other ethnicities/nationalities. This is because Israel considers Palestinians a demographic threat. This is a major point toward Israel being an apartheid state.   A large number of South African anti-apartheid leaders have pointed to Israel\'s policies in Gaza and the West Bank as being similar to the Bantustans. Being able to leave them is a privilege not afforded to just anyone.  Palestinians in annexed East Jerusalem were not granted the same rights as Israelis following annexation. They were given ""permanent residency"", which is not the same thing as citizenship, and can be revoked. This is to say nothing of the fact that Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem is in violation of international law. So they annexed an area and then didn\'t give the occupants the same rights as others. They can also lose this residency status, displacing them from their homeland. This is discriminatory.  I actually don\'t find the argument that Israel is an apartheid state to be that convincing all the time, but I can see why people feel that way. My general point with these topics is that Israel is committing ethnic cleansing and discrimination which we shouldn\'t be ok with.  Is the Arab world extremely anti-semitic? Yes, of course! I believe that Islam itself is honestly pretty anti-semitic. That doesn\'t mean that Israel isn\'t also discriminating against Palestinians. And Israel has a lot more power in this fight.   Was the ethnic cleansing of Jews in the Arab wrong? Yes! Does the Arab world owe Jews reparations? Also yes! That doesn\'t mean that the Nakba was ok, and it doesn\'t mean that reparations aren\'t needed.  Is Hamas genocidal? Yes! This doesn\'t mean that Israel should treat Palestinians as if they are a threat just by the nature of their nationality.']"

The Christian right is particularly prone to this idea that the left actually want to make things worse.  The left often believe that the right are willing to make things worse for some people for the benefit of others (e.g. make things worse for women for the benefit of men, make things worse for immigrants for the benefit of native born people).

It's completely toxic to politics. Thinking they disagree with you because they're racist usually doesn't have that effect. When it does, it is toxic too (I mean, unless you're talking about someone like David Duke who genuinely is racist to the point of not being worth engaging with).

Actually both of those cases upheld that the second ammendment referred to an individuals right to bear arms *but* that only applied to the federal government. This of course ignores the 14th ammendment and only started getting recognized under incorporation after th 1800s. Regardless the view was that the second ammendment was an individual right, and better yet, the incorporation of the ammendments to the states via the 14th makes it an individual right across the board.  The founding fathers were generally split in one of two ways, the second ammendment was absolute in providing the right to bear arms as an individual right to people, see Jefferson and Sam Adams, or that it was related to the preservation of the miltia, see Madison. A militia explicitly made of the common people and that those common people had the right to bear arms individually, and that those people were even *expected* to have arms at the ready. So the right to bear arms is predicted upon an individual ownership of said arms, contrary to what you said. Of course gun regulations can be legal then as it is now, such as universal background check or no guns for violent felons. Still an individual right though."", 'There\'s one even before that in the 1820s but it\'s so extremely obscure so I just didn\'t mention. There\'s also numerous quotes from guys like Jefferson alluding to if not outright stating that the right to bear arms was an individual right.  ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms."" - Thomas Jefferson, 1776  ""The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves; that it is their right and duty to be at all times"" Jefferson  ""A militia when properly formed are in fact the people themselves…and include, according to the past and general usuage of the states, all men capable of bearing arms… “To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.” Richard Henry   “The Constitution shall never be construed to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.” Samuel Adams.  ""The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.” Joseph Story, a Supreme Court Judge, 1833.  So no, the courts never ""just made it up, it\'s been consistently interpreted that way since the beginning, regardless of whether you like it or not.', '**No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.** - Thomas Jefferson, 1776  ""The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the **people; that they may exercise it by themselves;** that it is their right and duty to be at all times"" Jefferson  ""A militia when properly formed are in fact the **people themselves**…and include, according to the past and general usuage of the states, **all men capable of bearing arms**… “To preserve liberty, it is essential that the **whole body of the people always possess arms,** and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.” Richard Henry   “The Constitution shall never be construed to prevent the people of the United States who are **peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.**” Samuel Adams.  ""The **right of the citizens** to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.” Joseph Story, Supreme Court Justice, 1833.  Indeed, anytime a militia was called upon, individuals were expected to show up with **their own** armament, meaning that the right to bear arms was viewed to be an individual right.  And that the 2nd ammendment as an individual right has been upheld by the supreme court since the first firearm cases brought to them in the 1800s.  I know that was a lot of words for someone like yourself to comprehend, I highlighted the important bits so that hopefully you\'ll be able to figure out the plain text though. Best of luck.']"

There's a relevant difference here. In this scenario, as you stated, it simply isn't possible to have a society of full individual freedom. However, in our modern context, it is absolutely possible for individuals to not engage in overconsumption. Nothing is forcing them to overconsume. Our current economic system just makes it more likely for people to engage in unethical consumerism and overconsumption, and I already agreed our economic system should be reformed to deter this and make it less likely.

True, but you have to remember two things:  1- Aircraft were less complex in the 60\'s and 70\'s. From advanced RAM coatings to connected systems, development takes longer today.  2- The B2 program was started before the cold war ended. Once the Soviet Union collapsed, there really wasn\'t a need to build a newer, more advanced bomber since there was no one to use it against at the time.  ""The B-21 development is driven by politics not a strategic need.""  According to whom? The B2 fleet consists of just 20 aircraft and they are expensive to operate. The B1 fleet consists of about 100 aircraft but they are incredibly maintenance heavy and there are no plans to keep it in service beyond 2038 (assuming it lasts that long).  The B21 is a better aircraft than both. Stealthier than either one, more fuel efficient than either one, it has a connected cockpit unlike the B2, it costs less than the B2 to operate, it will be easier to maintain than the B1, it is capable of being operated unmanned. And most miraculous of all, it\'s actually on time and on budget right now, which was certainly not the case for the B1 or B2.  Obviously we need to wait and see how the program progresses, but so far it looks like exactly the right plane at exactly the right time.

Instead of making more game they remove some of what they already have and use the rest as bait. The result is an unsatisfying, hollow experience which requires often exorbitant payment to complete.  But that isn\'t a problem with the F2P model or even the transition to F2P, it is a problem rooted in game developers without the money or inclination to create new content to sell.

The threat of force is barely important for the functioning of all hierarchical societies. You make claims but you don’t defend them and, when you do, you fail.   This is word salad. Also not only do people not have to agree on everything, most of them *are not effected by that thing*.   Whatever you think I said doesn’t change the fact that it isn’t a strawman. It’s rich you think your fucking philosophy is the only kind of philosophy or that philosophy has any relevance to the question of “are you moving goalposts”.   Anarchy as “complete chaos” is actually workable and we can recontextualize “chaos” or “order” in all sorts of ways. Historical anarchists have done so, it isn’t as if “anarchy” didn’t mean “chaos” back then.   Not unless the general orders them to. And, by your logic, the people punching them should be in charge not the general because they’re not using violence at all.  See, there is literally no way you could argue that authority is derived from physical violence. It’s just not how things work.   Stop doing what? The general didn’t order them to punch people. He didn’t do anything at all.   This is nothing than a shoddy attempt at backpedaling. You’re arguing that authority is derived from violence but the authority in your situation hasn’t used violence at all.   If they’re using violence because the general ordered them to, the general hasn’t used violence. If they’re using violence because they love the general so much, *the general still didn’t use violence* (and also didn’t use their authority).  Either way, the general isn’t using violence nor, if the soldiers are going rogue, even commanding violence. Therefore the authority they have cannot be derived from violence.  This is another shitty argument that’s just as bad as the last one. You have a completely dogmatic attachment to the idea that authority = force. It’s fucking insane.   That’s circular logic. Their violence is only possible via equipment but they’re using violence to get that equipment? That doesn’t make sense.  In fact, the idea of a general strike relies on the fact that militaries need social support to exist. Without which they would be incapable of accomplishing anything. And equipment would be produced for the working class not rulers since they’re the ones who actually produce it.  Either way you’re wrong, they *buy* it or pay people to produce it. Literally every government does. That’s how thing actually work. Your ideas don’t resemble how reality actually works. That’s why it’s complete bullshit.   It isn’t. It’s achieved through literal houses of cards. Organizations are structured such that they depend on government for their existence. This leads to compliance with governmental authority and.in turn, obtains compliance elsewhere.   Those higher up in organizations and even those lower down don’t have any major incentive to disobey. For those higher up it’s the opposite. And the dominance of hierarchy everywhere along with its reliance upon government forces people to comply.   Yes they are words. Good job! Now read them.  Justification means “acting without consequence”. Any other meanings are non-material and therefore not necessary.   How old are you? You talk like it’s your first day speaking English.', "" I'm not dishonest or violent. It would be more dishonest if I lied. I don't give people personal information on the internet.   That implies there is a hierarchy between us of which there is not.   Having any sort of connection to the conversation. Insults have no substance since they are irrelevant.   No, it's because they are literally in control of your account. Your account isn't some vault or deposit with money. It's a legal fiction which only exists insofar as the government ensures it exists and, because it is a legal fiction, it plays by the government's rules.  Even if you walked in and withdrew all your money before dodging taxes, your account would still be frozen and would still have interest applied to it. You wouldn't be able to go to any bank or do a majority of the financial transactions you need to.  And that heavily impedes your mobility in society. You suddenly are unable to access a majority of the activities and institutions you rely on because all of those institutions or activities utilize banks in some way.   If they don't comply then they won't recognize the bank as legitimate which means it goes out of business. No one in their right mind will keep their money there, no one will invest, and it'll get shut down which means no one could invest or keep their money there even if they wanted to.  And they have no reason not to comply because those in charge of banks directly benefit from things moving as smoothly as possible and from continued obedience to authority. They know their dependency upon government for their existence.  At its core, it's all just ideology. Ideology which turns into practices that they reinforce each other. The inherent interdependency of human beings is what gives hierarchy its power. Not violence or force.   Not physically coercive.   Yes. Physical coercion does not need to be fundamental to hierarchy in order to exist. That's just a fiction your broken, drug-riddled brain produced.   They're systematically coercive but, like I said before, you need voluntary obedience on a day-to-day level for the continued maintenance of hierarchy.  And that's why anarchists oppose *all* hierarchies, including voluntary ones.   Because I am an anarchist. I oppose *hierarchy* not violence. That is the distinction between you and me. You are not an anarchist.  You see no utility in opposing hierarchy if there is no violence. Even if it systematically coercion, as long as there is no physical coercion it's fine.  What a daft notion. So narrow-minded and dogmatic in your adherence to the idea that force is authority that, if it wasn't, you'd be fine with it."", '   I\'m not giving you any personal information. Also that\'s relatively young. Why are you so fucked up?     There you go, nothing of substance is behind your words. Just dogma.    They have been successful but the point is that hierarchy reinforces itself through interlocking social practices. All human beings are interdependent and all social activity relies on other social activity.   As such, if all or most social activity is organized in a particular way, each organization is strengthened by the shared institutions and practices of all the others. This makes opposing hierarchy very difficult.  Coincidentally, if all social activity was organized anarchically, opposing anarchy would be very difficult. That\'s how anarchy defends itself.   Yet that doesn\'t explain which came first. And, unlike the chicken or egg problem, you have no way of explaining how violence could have been first used if there was no capacity to use it.   This is a non-argument. No one is arguing that violence or equipment don\'t both exist, I\'m asking you how could violence be used in the first place if there was no equipment to use it?  If you need lots of social support to produce anything resembling a military, then ""they used a military"" isn\'t an explanation for how that social support was obtained. Because militaries wouldn\'t exist without that social support in the first place.  By the way, doubling down and admitting that your logic is circular is hilarious. The fact that you think there is nothing wrong with circular logic is even more hilarious.   The government doesn\'t force you to pay taxes. The consequence of not paying taxes is the government taking money out of your bank account, putting interest on it, or freezing your assets. In other words, they use their authority over banks or other financial institutions to fuck you over. They don\'t use any violence against you.  The closest they would come to using violence is appropriating your assets and not only is that a last resort but that won\'t happen to you unless you\'ve committed massive tax fraud.    I didn\'t mention it because that\'s not what the consequences of taxation are. You\'re fucking 32 and you don\'t even know what happens if you don\'t pay taxes?   It isn\'t necessary at all. Also I already have. Your arguments thus far have either been:  ""People who obey authority are the same/extensions of authorities""  or  ""Circular logic""  Both of these are laughable and I\'ve already dismissed them. The other arguments you\'ve made depend on literal 5 year old understandings of how government works. Or more specifically, how a 5 year old would understand government if taught by an American libertarian.   No amount of physical coercion could last long enough to actually cause indoctrination. Physical coercion, like direct physical coercion, is absolutely unstable and does not last long period. It isn\'t even a form of organization because the threat must constantly be there and there can be no opening for rebellion (which they are almost always is).  Hierarchies are not based around physical coercion. They are not established by physical coercion. These are claims you continue to fail to defend.   You have no way of dealing with the basic fact that people who are ordered to use violence aren\'t physically coerced. This basic observation is something you\'re incapable of addressing. That alone showcases the stupidity of your ideas.   I\'m the only one here asserting that hierarchy is established and maintained through interconnected and mutually dependent groups or institutions. I\'ve had a systematic perspective the entire time. You only stumbled onto a vaguely ""systematic"" perspective out of sheer goalpost moving.   I have. The military, capitalism, government, patriarchy, etc.    Just because sometimes force is used by people who live in or are a part of social hierarchies does not mean that coercion is a fundamental part of it.  By that logic, eating oranges is a fundamental part of being a police officer because some police officers eat oranges.  This is the equivalent of ""drinking water is bad because Hitler did it"" as if drinking water was a fundamental part of Hitler\'s character.   We\'re not redefining ""chaos"", we\'re extending or recontextualizing what it means. Anarchy is the absence of authority, this is what it actually means most of the time, and people take that to mean chaos but it doesn\'t have to be.  So quit being a fucking idiot with zero critical thinking skills and start actually learning how to read.']"

What I found jn both instances was that cash became a very powerful tool for buying big ticket items, even if you aren’t spending as much on those items.  It’s the expansion of your own debt that you need to watch in good economic times, and especially when times are uncertain.  It became very hard to in 2009 and for a few years after, even, as lending standards tightened up.    I expect that the GFC was an extreme outlier in its severity, but I also know that the “recession” of 2020 was not nearly as significant as it might have been.  I understand that the recession of 1980-1981 was quite significant as well, and I recall my parents tightening up their spending a lot, though I was just then school age.  That’s more what I expect this go ‘round.  Lending on big ticket purchases will be very difficult, think homes and cars, and the unemployment number might be quite elevated, 6-8%.

If one’s job and income holds steady throughout, yeah, great opportunity to perhaps score a home or a used auto for what will seem like a “deal” compared to the inflation in everything these past couple years.', ""Ok how about this. The Fed becomes a national public bank. Anyone can deposit savings at the Fed and get the current interest rate. Additionally, it makes loans against good collateral and to those with good credit. Naturally these loans will be rather conservative - mostly home loans and direct business investment. We'll also increase democratic control, possibly with different branches so that state and local governments can exercise some control over what loans get made. This gets rid of the private banks as middlemen, although there will still be a role for private banks to make investments, since the public bank will not lend to riskier projects and borrowers.  Ask for expanding the money supply, well, the federal government already does this when it spends. I don't see any particular reason why we should make some kind of rule like 3% annually - if Congress feels that the economy needs to be stimulated, they can increase the deficit, and vice versa. As flawed as this process can sometimes be, I still would prefer to have more direct democratic control over how new money is spent, rather than leaving it up to an institution that is more removed from democratic oversight.  Of course, the FED will still have a similar balance sheet to what it has right now. The money that you and I deposit at the FED will show up on their balance sheet as a liability, as it must, because of course, that is money they owe you. I don't see this as a problem at all, and in fact I don't see any alternative. Dollars will and must be obligations of the government which can be redeemed for our own obligation to the government (i.e. the tax liability).  The really big change here would be to allow holders of dollars to directly use and benefit from the public monetary infrastructure we have set up. By making the Fed public, or even setting up an entirely new public bank, we can bypass the private banking cartel and have a monetary system that is responsive to democratic control, more transparent, and can serve the general needs of the public at large. Do you think that would be a positive change that would address at least some of your concerns?"", "" Right off the bat, I would like to point out that the effect of interest rates on the marginal propensity to save and invest is much harder to deduce empirically than the macroeconomic wisdom would suggest. Additionally, since the majority of Bank lending is against real estate, most of the action has to take place through the so-called wealth effect. Again, it's tough to show a strong empirical relationship here.  Additionally, while raising interest may slow Bank lending to some degree, it increases government deficit spending. If government deficit spending increases more than the decrease in private credit creation, then the policy ends up being inflationary rather than deflationary. The bigger the government deficit, the truer this is. And I don't think I have to tell you that government deficits have been pretty high in recent history.  But okay, let's assume there IS a deflationary impact from raising interest rates. Let's assume that Banks start lending less to businesses, and consumers start taking on less debt (which is directly contrary to the recent evidence that shows an INCREASE, not a decrease, in private sector debt, but w/e). How is this supposed to help the economically precarious who are living paycheck to paycheck? They have little to no savings, so the incentives to save vs invest mean very little. Meanwhile, decreased investment and demand means higher unemployment. Even if we manage to get prices under control, it comes at the expense of the material well-being of all the newly unemployed people. People with good job security might benefit from this, but the most disposable and economically precarious workers will be hurt the most. So this ends up being a pretty regressive policy.  You can see this even more clearly when you look at who hire interest rates benefit, i.e., savers. Raising interest rates is a policy choice to give people with money free interest income from Treasury securities. It clearly benefits the most those with the most money to save. In a relatively unequal society like ours, where the wealth is already flowing increasingly to a smaller and smaller number of people at the very top, why would we want such a regressive policy?  If inflation is the problem, interest rates are not the answer. First, because interest rate policy is clearly just not super effective at controlling inflation. Second, it is a regressive policy that prioritizes the wealth of the already well off over the material well-being of the worst off.  To the extent that inflation is a problem, the solution is not monetary but fiscal policy. By tightening the fiscal stance in a progressive manner, we can reduce or reverse the growth of the money supply while making sure that it does not come at the cost of the material well-being of the most vulnerable in our society. It may seem difficult or even impossible to find the political will to do this; nonetheless, it is the only real effective solution. Interest rate policy is the fed's hammer, and it will use it whether or not it is truly the right tool for the job. But the true fiscal power lies with Congress.""]"

You have no idea what you\'re talking about.   The pronouns you use for someone are dependent on your perception of their gender presentation. [There has been an enormous body of research into the effects of gender in language \\(and yes -- it\'s called linguistic gender\\) influence our perceptions of people and the world.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-language-shapes-thought/). There are plenty of languages that gender sexless nouns, use non-gendered pronouns for people, or contain third (or more) grammatically gendered pronouns, and the way we use those pronouns is based on perception and convention. See: ""Psycholinguistic investigations of the way readers and **speakers perceive gender** have shown several biases associated with how gender is linguistically realized in language"" ([Gygax et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31379661/)) [emphasis added]. Furthermore, it is well documented that in natural-gender languages like English, this correlation that you\'re making between sex and gendered pronouns is simply because it\'s been reinforced, and ""grammatical gender itself is not a cultural label but a concept with psychological reality"" ([Samuel et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-019-01652-3)).   We know that gender in language influences our perception of the world psychologically, but the way a person perceives their place in a social group and their concept of self is well-documented to have influence on their well-being and mental health. This has both good and bad implications, obviously, but identification with a social group is important to our psychological perception of the world.   * ""Gender is a key determinant of our self-concept and our perceptions of others. It shapes our mental health, our career paths, and our most intimate relationships"" ([Morgenroth &amp; Ryan](https://oxfordre.com/psychology/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-309;jsessionid=640DFEF1EA7C80F143EAFBEEEB661FDA)). * ""Sexual differentiation of the genitals takes place before sexual differentiation of the brain, making it possible that they are not always congruent"" ([Roselli](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6677266/)).  * ""Whether it is based on sex, skin color, or even determined arbitrarily, membership in a social group exerts a profound influence on human behavior, with both positive and negative implications. Specifically membership in a social group has been shown to promote a positive social identity from which individuals can derive self-esteem and a sense of belongingness or connectedness to others and serve as a buffer during times of stress. However, membership in a social group can also promote negative biases toward out-group members, derogation of in-group members who violate group norms, and disengagement from certain areas in which one’s group has been negatively stereotyped (for example, women and math)"" ([Lurye et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661758/).)   You can call this made up silliness all you want, but here are the facts. Some people have a sincere feeling of themselves that their self-concept of gender doesn\'t match their body. We know that this dysphoria is harmful to them psychologically. When those individuals are allowed to present themselves in a way that match their self-concept and identify with that group, [the rates of depression and sucidality go down](https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext). As well, [transitioning their gender presentation and having social acceptance is one of the largest factors in reducing suicide risk.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/). It doesn\'t matter whether you believe in the concept of gender identity. It causes harm to people when others do not accept their concept of self. You don\'t have to agree with someone to not want them to suffer. You\'re not making some important ideological stand against something by refusing to acknowledge gender identity.
