I\'ll stick latter, since that\'s one really defend. Let give hypothetical simple baseline scenario employment would look like, contrast private entrepreneurship could look like: Basic Universal Income 500€ per month covers governmentally produced food, rental homes, electricity, new clothes stuff. order start earning UBI, employee would work 10 hours/week. employed person may earn 2500€. Governmentally coordinated production would prioritise core needs, would also provide luxury products meet consumer demand feasible available labour, charging necessary cost products. saved enough afford it, people would free start personal businesses including joined projects, (they could additionally work govermental employ, waive UBI earn enough privately) create products government cover. profits beyond 2500€ per month per private employee would paid government annually. crux: want avoid private business taking over, limit personally owned wealth beyond certain value. personally like idea one person ever allowed save 12 monthly incomes, would probably higher number. Anyway, since company funds would perpetually limited amount privately cooperating owners limited capital, potential increasing profit exist, motivation feed private businesses would spiral consumerism od control would minimal. ever enough entrepreneurs create massive business would succeed cooperating effort, product would likely turned product would provided publicly - even wouldn\'t, corporation would much effort maintain, risk would keep growing even related businesses. Ultimately right solution would finetuned suit democratic input, politicians would construct compromises around fundamental principle everyone\'s basic needs take precedent luxury (unless society decided abolish basic-needs socialism) government would provide much people able save demand. demand demonstrated, private market cover it. That\'s especially important things like commissioned art.

Notice exclamation mark means. common scripture. words strong greek. Anyone would wish Christian must understand danger sin choose life fighting free spirit. Scripture tells us take sin lightly either understand high price paid redemption appreciate anyway (hebrews 10:29) lose grace given them. Christ paid high price blood suffering. word excruciating created describe unimaginable pain literally tearing body apart fight take breath (the cross actually kills asphyxiation). gave everything put end sin. expects people respect gravity situation yes sin redeemed twisting scripture make certain sins look less dangerous leads dangerous places. want know Book 1 John half subject address similar lie putting greek believers danger. Basically greeks found round way saying sin really body guilty anything. they\'re believing sin way ""no biggie"" putting danger.']"

However, courts returned number times, reaffirmation conclusion, original source idea bill rights applied federal government. said, let’s look incorporation. applicable section 14A states: “ state shall make enforce law shall abridge privileges immunities citizens United States; shall state deprive person life, liberty, property without due process law...” bill rights represents privileges immunities US citizens. 14A, effect, automatically incorporated bill rights states.
