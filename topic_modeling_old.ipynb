Yes, there would be lives lost by harmful drugs the FDA didn't get off the market. But it's way less than the amount of lives you would save by not delaying life saving drugs. Take the covid vaccine for example. They had promising results for those in summer of 2020. And even with a record breaking EUA process, the FDA still cost thousands of lives by delaying an incredibly effective vaccine by an additional 7 months.  Early on in the pandemic, there were also several companies that had created rapid tests that met world health organization standards. But because the FDA decided to take their time reviewing them a second time, tests were pretty much non existant outside of hospitals for the first few months of the pandemic, making it extremely difficult to find any outbreak sources before they spiraled out of control.  And no, the efficiency claim is not an option to skirt around the FDA, unless your product didn't need FDA approval in the first place. (ie some vitimins ect). It used to be the case, prior to the 1962 amendments by Kennedy.   A company cannot make any claim in their marketing unless approved by the FDA.\",\n",

Do you guys seriously not see that your ( By \"your\" I mean the prevailing sentiment that is average of liberals as a collective I obviously can\\'t speak for any of you individually)  hate for Musk seems to correlate with your leaders taking issue  with him.When your leaders take issue with or support something the media you consume will get busy indoctrination you with said perspective. This happens through repetition and through the affirmation from your peers who are being subjected to the same narrative.  This is true for both sides.   If you cannot see the inherent bias in your media and the flaws in your leaders as well as the positives in the opposition then its safe to say you\\'ve been compromised and your being influenced, if not outright manipulated. Again this is true for most people regardless of their political leanings.   The reason why this is so Cleary the case with Musk is because most people give the see vague reasons why they dislike him.  Truth is he\\'s bizzare because he\\'s a very unique individual,  a one off,.he\\'s highly intelligent in certain areas but lacks social intelligence.  This is actually extremely common for people like him.  People  talk crap about him being some elitist billionaire or being a narcissist or megalomaniac. He\\'s none of those things.... well he is definitely a billionaire but other than his jet which honestly is a necessity when you are a CEO of a larğge and rapidly expanding international company.  But other than that he\\'s not ai typical of some elitist D-bag billionaire.   Musk has enough money for neither him or his family to ever need to work again. I seriously mean never. Not his kids ,grandkids, great grand  kids etc. Yet all he does is work . For a while he had a tiny home  that he\\'d stay in at the space X launch pad but I\\'ve heard many talk about him often sleeping on the factory floor so he can keep getting things done if it calls for it.  He\\'s singlehandedly responsible for the wide adoption of Evs. Because the innovations they\\'ve made have  lowers  costs significantly.  They make great products that people enjoy and that will last a long time. Not only that but each of their products has the potential to make its owner money. But they have to make great products because they have no marketing department. When\\'s the last time you\\'ve seen a Tesla add or dealership? They don\\'t have them which is friggin insane, completely unheard of for any large corporate producer of any product. This is why a socially awkward Musk is always stirring things up and causing a buzz with his tweets.Henis Teslas marketing department. That fact alone saves the company 100s of millions as year.  There\\'s also the fact that once you understand his vision and how all of the products all of his companies are meant to be integrated. His vision of the future is a good one too. While billionaires like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates claim to be about the environment ,in reality that aren\\'t. Instead they are about control.  All their ideas involve more regulations, less freedom for us,and more control for them. You\\'ve got Gates preaching deportation and trying to get everyone to leave rural areas cand consolidate into major cities. Conveniently this will make people easier to control. But while he preaches that he\\'s busy buying up as much farmland as he cN get his hands on. Gates is now the largest owner of farms in the country. This is a very bad thing. I mean it\\'s already bad enough that the vast majority of all products at the grocery store are owned by only a handful  of companies. Imagine if only a handful grow all the food. Talk about power.1😬 Swab is preaching the great reset saying \"you\\'ll own nothing but be happy \" All of their visions for our future are ones where all of us have to be OK with having significantly less while they get more. Musk on the other hand has a vision where things in the future are more decentralized so they give power to each individual rather than for him and his billionaire buddies Ike Gates and Schwab want.  Musk doesn\\'t care about money or power. His motivation is one of impact. He wants to change the world in a significantly meaningful way. Sure you could  say that alone is selfish because he could be motivated by wanting ro be remembered and leaving  a legacy, but who doesn\\'t want that?  All I want to know is where we\\'re you guys when Twitter and FB were deliberately censoring or silencing people in order to manipulate people into voting for the candidates they back. This means that liberals were obviously the ones who were indoctrinated. That doesn\\'t make you mad? Musk just released a ton of files show the blatant corruption and collision between liberal politicians and social media.  Coincidentally it was after he did this that they began attacking Musk hardcore. And all of you are now doing their bidding.  It\\'s crazy. Why are all of you so obsessed with Musk...wait until he gets things dialed and reveals the real reason why he bought Twitter.....it\\'s friggin genius and will benefit all of us greatly.  Yet you guys run around parroting concerns and hating on someone you don\\'t even know and whose actions do no harm to you whatsoever. Hate all you want, it\\'s what unsuccessful people do. Just understand that a wolf cares not of the opinions of sheep.

I remember saving a link to something he wrote on this very topic a while back, saved it as an example of what [Bertrand de Jouvenel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_de_Jouvenel) called a 'High-Low vs. Middle' power struggle:          -------------------  The point about mass immigration being a sign of imperial decline is also a point pointed out in The Fate of Empires and Search for Survival by [John Bagot Glubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bagot_Glubb):     great empires is the influx of foreigners to the capital city.   complain of the number of Asians and Africans in Rome.    the ninth century, was international in its population—Persians, Turks, Arabs, Armenians, Egyptians, Africans and Greeks mingled in its streets.   Italians, Russians, Africans, Germans and Indians jostle one another on the buses and in the underground, so that it sometimes seems difficult to find any British.   applies to New York, perhaps even more so. This problem does not consist in any inferiority of one race as compared with another, but simply in the differences between them.   subsequent Age of Conquests, the race is normally ethnically more or less homogeneous. This state of affairs facilitates a feeling of solidarity and comradeship. But in the Ages of Commerce and Affluence, every type of foreigner floods into the great city, the streets of which are reputed to be paved with gold.   city is also the capital of the empire, the cosmopolitan crowd at the seat of empire exercises a political influence greatly in excess of its relative numbers.  immigrants may appear outwardly to be entirely assimilated, but they often constitute a weakness in two directions.   basic human nature often differs from that of the original imperial stock. If the earlier imperial race was stubborn and slowmoving, the immigrants might come from more emotional races, thereby introducing cracks and schisms into the national policies, even if all were equally loyal.  the diverse races may appear equally loyal. But in an acute emergency, the immigrants will often be less willing to sacrifice their lives and their property than will be the original descendants of the founder race.   communities of their own, protecting primarily their own interests, and only in the second degree that of the nation as a whole.   will probably belong to races originally conquered by and absorbed into the empire. While the empire is enjoying its High Noon of prosperity, all these people are proud and are glad to be imperial citizens. But when decline sets in, it is extraordinary how the memory of ancient wars, perhaps centuries before, is suddenly revived, and local or provincial movements appear demanding secession or independence.   will doubtless appear in the now apparently monolithic and authoritarian Soviet empire. It is amazing for how long such provincial sentiments can survive.   are scarcely needed.    Roman mob, with its endless appetite for free distributions of food—bread and games—is notorious, and utterly different from that stern Roman spirit which we associate with the wars of the early republic. In Baghdad, in the golden days of Harun al-Rashid, Arabs were a minority in the imperial capital.   of Ottoman rule, was peopled by inhabitants remarkably few of whom were descendants of Turkish conquerors. In New York, descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers are few and far between.   limited to great cities. The original conquering race is often to be found in relative purity in rural districts and on far frontiers.   draws the immigrants. As, with the growth of industry, cities nowadays achieve an ever greater preponderance over the countryside, so will the influence of foreigners increasingly dominate old empires.   not wish to convey the impression that immigrants are inferior to older stocks.

They could also do this by fighting for higher wages, but in any case workers saving money to start co-ops isn't going to be the thing that transitions us out of the current system.   Child rearing, care of the elderly, housekeeping etc is not outside of the capitalist economy, but totally necessary for it: it's called reproductive labour in the sense that it's labour necessary for the creation and maintenance of the workforce. Neither is it outside of the wage economy, many people are (under)paid for this work as it is and that number is increasing, at least in the west.  The rest of what you're describing are just hobbies, the things that workers would have more free time to do if a) they fought for shorter working hours in the here and now, and b) abolished capitalism, which would shorten working hours immediately by eliminating work not necessary for human needs.  Think about the character of what a struggle for UBI would look like: alliances with bourgeois politicians who want to implement UBI, voting drives to vote for these politicians, begging the state to give us the free money. Think about what a struggle for higher wages and shorter hours looks like on the other hand: workers banding together in unions, collectively withdrawing their  labour or threatening it to force their employers hand, confronting the laws of the state that favour their employers, reaching out to other workers for solidarity etc. Which is more  productive to you, in terms of the development of a militant working class?\",\n",

Anyone and everyone will receive money, and most people require such funds to live - so no one would be above your skepticism unless money were abolished. Worse yet, the ones who would be 'independently wealthy' would also be of the group that has 'independent power' they'd want to conserve and protect, meaning even they themselves wouldn't be beyond skepticism.  The science, however, stands apart from corruption in such that people will eventually examine bad science and pick it apart.

The corporate interests that wanted to claim lead was safe in every day applications also were outnumbered substantially and shouted down.

I think if people want to be inconsistent with their Anarchism, it\\'s fine, *so long as* their inconsistency sides with Anarchism. That is, perhaps it\\'s abstractly incorrect (again, a Christian anarchist would not see it this way) for the Christian part of Christian Anarchism to support Anarchism - but as long as Christian Anarchists support Anarchism over Christianity, I don\\'t really care if their religious ideals are abstractly contradictory. If instead they were inconsistent *as Anarchists*, I would care - ie, patriarchy based in Christian faith is consistent with some forms of Christianity, but it\\'s incompatible with Anarchism, so I care if an Anarchist Christian is patriarchal, because internal inconsistency in one\\'s Anarchist principles *is* damaging to Anarchism.         Valid point. I typically speak in an ultimate sense, rather than an immediate one, but yes, in the immediate sense, AnCaps are not our allies, even accidentally. (I have other opinions on this that muddy this a bit, but they\\'re not worth going into here.)         I\\'ve never met an AnCap in real life, but I\\'ve met plenty online, and I can say based on that that many of them are just Market Anarchists confused about what Capitalism is. (Not most, but many. Most are StateCorp boot-lickers, or StateCorp-adjacent.)      Market Anarchism (which I tend to call Market-Socialist Anarchism to remind people that it\\'s a form of Socialism, not Capitalism - Market Anarchists tend to be badly misunderstood, even by fellow Anarchists) is a strain of Anarchism which states that markets are a good way of figuring out who wants/needs what, but that Capitalism is not a good market system. There are many strains of Market Anarchism, which arguably includes everything from Mutualism to Left-Rothbardianism, and everything in-between. (Left-Rothbardianism is an oddball ideology, I\\'ll admit that much.) Anyhow, Market Anarchism essentially posits that markets (including money) can/should still exist in Anarchism. This basically just means \"Anarchists who are not AnCom.\" Individual theories within the tradition have a variety of specific positions, but all are anti-Capitalism.      I personally am a Meta-Anarchist, so I\\'d like to see AnCom and various communities with differing social and economic forms emerge within an Anarchist framework. This is because I\\'m sure many would enjoy AnCom, but I personally would not - I\\'m far too antisocial for an economic arrangement of that nature. At the same time, I don\\'t want to take that from people who would enjoy it - therefore, let many forms of Anarchism flourish, and I can live in the one that suits me, and others can live in the ones that suit them.',\n",

Ironic considering your commentary.   I will not deny I have not read The Civil War in France (1870) yet but besides that there’s nothing else you have said that has been further from the truth so fuck off with your profiling.  You said Marx had a different view of the Dictatorship of the proletariat from what MLs claim it to be. You also gave a very poor characterization of what MLs believe the DOTP to be. I detest people who do this type of shit then give a fucking Wikipedia article as their reference. The more politically charged a topic is the more a knowledge database where supposedly EVERYONE can contribute to the development of it has so many holes in how a communist could just take it with a grain of salt. Quotes can be cherry picked so easily it’s just more irony of the situation considering your original call out was about taking Marx out of context.   Lenin has already said plenty about the counter arguments posed by Kautsky in the 2nd International regarding Marx’s commentary on the DOTP (which is where you’re getting this from whether you’re aware of it or not):  ”Let us point out, in passing, that when calling the non-Bolsheviks in Russia, i.e., the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, socialists, Kautsky was guided by their name, that is, by a word, and not by the actual place they occupy in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. What a wonderful understanding and application of Marxism!”  “The question of the dictatorship of the proletariat is a question of the relation of the proletarian state to the bourgeois state, of proletarian democracy to bourgeois democracy. One would think that this is as plain as a pikestaff. But Kautsky, like a schoolmaster who has become as dry as dust from quoting the same old textbooks on history, persistently turns his back on the twentieth century and his face to the eighteenth century, and for the hundredth time, in a number of paragraphs, in an incredibly tedious fashion chews the old cud over the relation of bourgeois democracy to absolutism and medievalism!”  “But this means he utterly fails to understand what is what! One cannot help smiling at Kautsky’s effort to make it appear that there are people who preach “contempt for democracy” (p. 11) and so forth. That is the sort of twaddle Kautsky uses to befog and confuse the issue, for he talks like the liberals, speaking of democracy in general, and not of *bourgeois democracy*[my italics]; he even avoids using this precise, class term, and, instead, tries to speak about “presocialist” democracy. This windbag devotes almost one-third of his pamphlet, twenty pages out of sixty-three, to this twaddle, which is so agreeable to the bourgeoisie, for it is tantamount to embellishing bourgeois democracy, and obscures the question of the proletarian revolution.”  This view” (which Kautsky dubs “contempt for democracy”) “rests upon a single word of Karl Marx’s”. This is what Kautsky literally says on page 20. And on page 60 the same thing is repeated even in the form that they (the Bolsheviks) “opportunely recalled the little word” (that is literally what he says—des Wörtchens!!) “about the dictatorship of the proletariat which Marx once used in 1875 in a letter”.  Here is Marx’s “little word\":   First of all, to call this classical reasoning of Marx’s, which sums up the whole of his revolutionary teaching, “a single word” and even “a little word,” is an insult to and complete renunciation of Marxism. It must not be forgotten that Kautsky knows Marx almost by heart, and, judging by all he has written, he has in his desk, or in his head, a number of pigeon-holes in which all that was ever written by Marx is most carefully filed so as to be ready at hand for quotation. Kautsky must know that both Marx and Engels, in their letters as well as in their published works, repeatedly spoke about the dictatorship of the proletariat, before and especially after the Paris Commune. Kautsky must know that the formula “dictatorship of the proletariat” is merely a more historically concrete and scientifically exact formulation of the proletariat’s task of “smashing” the bourgeois state machine, about which both Marx and Engels, in summing up the experience of the Revolution of 1848, and, still more so, of 1871, spoke for forty years, between 1852 and 1891.”   [All of this and plenty more can be found in the 1st chapter of Lenin’s *The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/common_liberal.htm)   I doubt you will read all of this much like you won’t read that book but I’m plenty read on the subject of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

True monopolies that are actually problematic control their markets entirely. They are able to set both supply and price to whatever they want, have no threat from competition, and subsequently have no motivation to provide a quality product.  All it takes is one or two major competitors to foil this. Just because a market is consolidated, it doesn\\'t mean that it isn\\'t insanely competitive.

A lot of stats suggest the change *increased* the number of students from lower income backgrounds who go to university (maybe because there are more maintenance grants for living costs for people on low incomes being funded by the new tuition fees), or at least, the number has increased regardless of that change. Also, like, it's theoretically always affordable, and it's important to understand how the system works, it's arguably pretty fair. You do take out a loan of around £9000 a year to pay for your course, but interest is taken as a percentage of income above about £27k a year, like a tax, after your graduate, and if in 30 years you haven't paid it off the rest is cancelled. So theoretically if someone leaves university and can't make much money they won't pay much at all, while the service is subsidised by high earners who got high-paying work from their degrees. Arguably it's a fairer system than funding from the taxpayer, if more complex.  At the end of the day, people who go to university on average will still make more over a lifetime than people who don't, including tuition fees and the years of lost work. I think the system as it is works fine to be honest, even if it is a bit bureaucratic and does ultimately saddle people with debt (that, at the same time, is not that bad as debt goes).\",\n",

If one doesn't consider the project already failed and more or less ceded to the Russian Federation.   Most of the communists, those of a more international position, who were associated with the projects of Lugansk and Donetsk republics have fled, hid or died in various assassinations and artillery shellings. The communists were seen as the larger threat, as they specifically addressed ethnic Ukrainians in the Ukrainian language in their propaganda. They were primary targets of the post-coup Ukrainian government. For them, Donetsk and Lugansk were supposed to be successors of a legitimate Ukrainian SR, that could potentially grow if more people rebelled against the coup. The Dugin-influenced patsoc's are more friendly to the Russian Federation. Safety for ethnic Russians, rather than socialism, is the core of their position, so they get better protection from Russia. They have become the primary political force in the separatist regions.   While these ethnically Russian Patsoc's are obviously quite wrong, and dangerous to minorities in Russia, they did not spring from nowhere. There are tens of thousands of stateless ethnic Russians who were denied citizenship and rights in various post-soviet states, including Ukraine, and lacked the means to go somewhere else at their own expense, as was demanded by the new states. While there is plenty to be said for Russian imperialism before the revolution and their status as a dominant or preferred ethnicity in conquered territory, and for chauvinist attitudes in later years, that is not the universal experience. It also doesn't help that they adopt a nostalgia for the Soviet Union and its imagery, but without socialist politics, which is shallow and deceptive.   At best, one could argue that they make the necessary compromises to mobilize ethnic Russians against western capitalist influence. At worst, and I'm quite pessimistic, they belong to capitalists more fully than they admit and lack revolutionary potential on the basis of that ethnocentrism.

       " '    I have genuinely tried to be generous here (despite your repeated antagonism), but I have a graduate degree in language and have done research on gender/linguistics; you can\\'t use a semicolon correctly to save your life. You have no idea what you\\'re talking about.   The pronouns you use for someone are dependent on your perception of their gender presentation. [There has been an enormous body of research into the effects of gender in language \\\\(and yes -- it\\'s called linguistic gender\\\\) influence our perceptions of people and the world.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-language-shapes-thought/). There are plenty of languages that gender sexless nouns, use non-gendered pronouns for people, or contain third (or more) grammatically gendered pronouns, and the way we use those pronouns is based on perception and convention. See: \"Psycholinguistic investigations of the way readers and **speakers perceive gender** have shown several biases associated with how gender is linguistically realized in language\" ([Gygax et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31379661/)) [emphasis added]. Furthermore, it is well documented that in natural-gender languages like English, this correlation that you\\'re making between sex and gendered pronouns is simply because it\\'s been reinforced, and \"grammatical gender itself is not a cultural label but a concept with psychological reality\" ([Samuel et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-019-01652-3)).   We know that gender in language influences our perception of the world psychologically, but the way a person perceives their place in a social group and their concept of self is well-documented to have influence on their well-being and mental health. This has both good and bad implications, obviously, but identification with a social group is important to our psychological perception of the world.   * \"Gender is a key determinant of our self-concept and our perceptions of others. It shapes our mental health, our career paths, and our most intimate relationships\" ([Morgenroth &amp; Ryan](https://oxfordre.com/psychology/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-309;jsessionid=640DFEF1EA7C80F143EAFBEEEB661FDA)). * \"Sexual differentiation of the genitals takes place before sexual differentiation of the brain, making it possible that they are not always congruent\" ([Roselli](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6677266/)).  * \"Whether it is based on sex, skin color, or even determined arbitrarily, membership in a social group exerts a profound influence on human behavior, with both positive and negative implications. Specifically membership in a social group has been shown to promote a positive social identity from which individuals can derive self-esteem and a sense of belongingness or connectedness to others and serve as a buffer during times of stress. However, membership in a social group can also promote negative biases toward out-group members, derogation of in-group members who violate group norms, and disengagement from certain areas in which one’s group has been negatively stereotyped (for example, women and math)\" ([Lurye et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661758/).)   You can call this made up silliness all you want, but here are the facts. Some people have a sincere feeling of themselves that their self-concept of gender doesn\\'t match their body. We know that this dysphoria is harmful to them psychologically. When those individuals are allowed to present themselves in a way that match their self-concept and identify with that group, [the rates of depression and sucidality go down](https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext). As well, [transitioning their gender presentation and having social acceptance is one of the largest factors in reducing suicide risk.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/). It doesn\\'t matter whether you believe in the concept of gender identity. It causes harm to people when others do not accept their concept of self. You don\\'t have to agree with someone to not want them to suffer. You\\'re not making some important ideological stand against something by refusing to acknowledge gender identity. You\\'re just being an asshole.',\n",

       " 'Basically, humans are dipping into fossil fuel reserves locked up underground by natural geologic processes of the carbon cycle and releasing carbon dioxide into the air. Carbon dioxide is a gas that traps heat (which is a greenhouse gas), so the more of it there is in the atmosphere, the warmer it gets. We keep on adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, so we are continuing to cause warming. However, it isn’t as simple as adding carbon dioxide directly increases warming. The addition of carbon dioxide and subsequent warming causes instabilities in other parts of the earth system, for example the salt concentration of ocean water. The warming causes melting of ice caps, which lessen the saltiness of sea water and disrupt ocean currents. As I mentioned before, the disruption of the Gulf Stream by the melting of Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice cap could disrupt the flow of the Gulf Stream to Europe, thereby plunging Europe into freezing temperatures as it is in a high latitude and is only kept mild by the warm Gulf Stream current. This is just one example, and the gist of it is that the addition of co2 to the atmosphere will cause a chain reaction of climate effects that will be entirely unpredictable. The only thing we can predict is the increase in atmospheric co2 concentrations, which will inevitably destabilize the climate. And the natural climate cycles never happen this quickly. Sure, we have the odd volcanic eruption that results in cooling, or increased solar activity that results in a little bit of warming, but we have seen an unprecedented increase in warming over the last 100 years, which directly correlates to the addition of co2 to the atmosphere by humans. Natural cycles do not cause change on such short scales, the processes that change the temperature/climate of earth either release co2 into the atmosphere (weathering of rock), or affect earths orbit/position (milankovitch cycles) operate on 1,000s to 100,000s of years. Meanwhile, this change has been occurring over little more than a century and directly parallels human consumption of fossil fuels, and is rising exponentially instead of at a steady rate.
