You’re under the impression that in the PCer’s argument - the factor that changes between an abortion and fetal homicide is the “life” part. But that’s not what changes in our arguments. It’s the “unlawful” part.   It’s not that the fetus isn’t considered to be a life in any of my arguments against government abortion bans. My arguments *grant* that it is life. My arguments are that it is/should be *lawful* taking of a life.

So I’m not and never have tried to argue that the fetus isn’t a life.

This seems to ignore realistic thingd but ok.  Just for an example if two rights to life conflict then it becomes a complex issue as they can't both survive.   But in some situations you forfeit rights (or possibly it isn't a factor). Like in the above example.     This is irrelevant at this point as the first thing was only to say it is something you can guarantee against besides abstinence. Which was the only point. As some say you can.     True and also irrelevant. As of now it is not safe. Hopefully it will be in the future. But that is not guaranteed and not the case currently.  Note there are plenty of dangers besides death.  This would be like saying it is ok to push someone off a cliff that has a 50% survival rate since it'll be 100% safe in the future.     You acknowledged the issue at the end. Most of this is comparable to the requirement that parents must care for their child and neglect is punishable. But the difference is that when talking about pregnancy it isn't purchasing or sharing food. It is giving another access to yourself for an indeterminate amount of time. And without seeing the future it can have life threatening complications.  This would be like the stowaway having a right to cut off and eat body parts of yours should you not have enough food to share.     Being human isn't what matters. Should we eventually evolve or develop into significantly different species those people wouldn't lose rights.  Being alive is not the important part as we question the potential of AI beings being rights and they may not be considered alive if they can't satisfy the criteria. A vegetative human is still technically alive but they lose their rights.  While we could discuss both neurologically and philosophically the points you made fundamentally the reason why people have rights isn't because of an arbitrary generic structure or our classifications of life. It is because it the many things we are capable of. Thinking. Feeling. Ect.  So no it isn't just being human and alive. At least I don't think so. If you do why is human a really important thing.     I'll agree we don't have any guarantees. But that is all the more reason why you shouldn't force a person to maybe the choice to carry to term unless they are willing to do all they can do to care for the born individual.  The developing embryo has no thoughts or cares. Just like all the other embryos that get naturally miscarried, and gamete. These all didn't develope to the stage of thought. Which is what the minimal would be and why we consider human life valuable  Killing something isn't immoral. We can talk about self defense. We can talk about eating. In this case. An embryo of a human was killed (neglected is a bit more accurate but kill is sufficient). This embryo doesn't have a person's value added just because to gamete met. The value arises from something more than that. Human cells aren't important as our skin cells peel off daily and nobody sheds a tear. Those cells were living as well. Even individual brain cells aren't of value of the person.  By your last bit. The best time to have a child should be all the time. Every time a woman ovulate or a man ejaculated all those combination of kids are gone.   I'm not seeing it yet. You are right that our laws are also to protect the helpless. But they protect people for the reasons we value people. We don't protect biologically human and alive things that don't have the important aspects of why we give people rights.  I'll only note that convenience is mainly a factor in what laws can be made. I could make a law protecting the feelings of everyone but it is implausible to carry out so a law like that won't be made.

The importance here is that the right to life of every person in the situation has at least been considered.  This only happens when there is a serious threat to life and is the essence of why we allow for life threat exceptions.  It is a consistent part of the pro-life ethic to allow these as both mother and child have the right to life.  It only in that instance does the mother\\'s life become also in danger, as opposed to only that of the child.

Here you make the common pro-choice mistake of ignoring the child in the situation, which we are not going to do.  Yes, pregnancy is not 100% safe, but abortion, is 100% fatal to the child.  You are arguing that we should accept a 100% fatality rate for one person to offset a less than 1% fatality rate for someone else.  That just doesn\\'t make any logical sense.   Question all you like, but the AI issue is not pertinent here.  For one thing, there is no such thing as AI yet.  So, it makes little sense to discuss how rights would work with them at this juncture except in the broadest of outlines.  Second, AI would presumably be alive in some fashion.  Any particular AI would need to have a physical existence which it ran on just like any other lifeform or computer.  In that sense, it will have the same physical reality as a human and its own development.  Thirdly, human rights and AI rights are two different things.  Human rights are based on human context.  An AI almost certainly will not have an entirely human context.  Consequently, the sort of rights an AI will find important may be very different from those which humans have.  That is why species is important.  A human has human rights because it is a human organism.  We share a context that is human which is informed by our physical structure and how that interacts with the world.  That is why we can make rules which apply to other humans.    An AI will not be human, by definition.  How that causes an AI to see the world will be different than us.  We can negotiate an understanding between us and AI, but we will always have different needs, and consequently, different views of life.  Just making the argument that we might have \"consciousness\" is not a good basis for rights.  You must holistically understand the context of the organism you are dealing with.     Humanity isn\\'t \"important\" in the sense that we are special.  Humanity is important in that it is how we relate to one another and our environment.  Human rights is the rules we make for ourselves when dealing with ourselves.  And we have the right to do that because we are only putting those obligations on ourselves for things that affect us.  Too many people take the wrong-headed position that it has something to do with humans being special.  That\\'s completely the wrong takeaway.  I don\\'t have to be superior to a dog or an AI to recognize that human organisms have particular needs that dogs or AIs might not have.  Our species, our rules.  There is nothing more to it than that.   I entirely disagree.  I am not requiring that the child be carried to term.  I am not even interested in whether the child lives or dies.  What I am interested in is that you do not kill them.  They don\\'t have a right to be kept alive at all costs, but they do have a right to not be killed.  And I am resolute in the position that you don\\'t have a crystal ball.  You can\\'t tell me that every child ever aborted was always going to have bad life.  Plenty of people survive abuse and shitty parents and turn out to have good, productive and happy lives.    More to the point, I am annoyed that excuse is given for an action that is almost always taken for the sole benefit of the person making it.  How the life goes for the child is just a way of trying to justify to themselves something they were going to do anyway, and pretend that it was all for the best.  It\\'s not all for the best.     Value is irrelevant.  Humans don\\'t have to earn human rights.  Even a \"valueless\" human is entitled to human rights.  Human rights is based on membership, not some sort of earned value.  It is alien to the idea of human rights that you have to demonstrate value to get them.     That makes no sense, though.  You know full well that we make laws all the time which cannot be completely carried out.  Have murder laws ended murder?  Have theft laws ended theft?  Of course not.  We make laws based on the rights of other humans, even if those laws cannot always be completely enforced.  And consider this.  Murder laws don\\'t catch every murderer, but they do catch many.  Abortion bans also won\\'t stop every abortion, but they have and will continue to stop many.  You cannot pretend that we only make convenient to enforce laws.  When it comes to the big issues, most of our laws are very inconvenient to enforce, but we still do it.',\n",

       " {'sequence': ' My reason for not allowing late term abortions is that when the fetus becomes viable, the woman now has a *new* option to back out of a pregnancy, which is to just give birth. The definition of fetus viability means that the fetus can survive outside the mother, so there’s no reason to abort. The fetus doesn’t have to use the mother’s body so she can cut off access to her body and her organs. Before viability, the the only option that women have to back out of a pregnancy is to abort. So bodily autonomy is respected in all cases. Also, remember that I said that abortion is healthcare (based on the definition of healthcare which doesn’t include whether it’s legal or not), and when the fetus becomes viable, women now have a new option to get healthcare without aborting.   If you hold that view, you have to show consistency in your view. Otherwise, what’s stopping people from conveniently applying their morals when they want to? Morals are subjective but *moral consistency* is important. In the car accident scenario, you took an action that had a risk of hurting someone else and yourself and that risk ended up occurring, but you still deserve healthcare and the government still can’t force you to donate organs or body parts in that case even if the other person would die. The pregnancy situation is *directly* analogous so the same rules should apply. If you don’t agree, then you need to present an objective argument why, not just say it’s because it’s what you personally believe. Because then I can easily just counter that I disagree because it’s my personal belief and we would never get anywhere.     When you give someone any power, there will always be someone who misuses it. Always. This doesn’t apply to just abortions. Most people use knives to cut vegetables and meat, but some psychos use it to kill innocent people. Most people use cars responsibly to get to places, but some people drive drunk or irresponsibly and end people’s lives. Most people use controlled medication responsibly, but some people will abuse those medications or give it to other people irresponsibly. The truth is that anytime you give people something, someone will misuse it, but that doesn’t mean most people will. Abortion is a difficult decision for a lot of women. I’ve heard so many pro-choice women saying that they personally would never get an abortion but they can’t choose for other people. I’ve heard of so many women who were literally pressured to get an abortion but still chose to keep the baby. Will some women misuse abortion and treat it like some sort of birth control? Sure, but you can’t take away something from a majority of people just because a small group of people would misuse it. Because then you would have to take away cars, planes, knives, controlled medication, hammers, guns, etc. Anything that someone could use to harm another person. Again, this is to maintain moral consistency.   Also, I just want to reiterate that bodily autonomy is important not because I say so or that it’s what I personally value. Like I said in my previous comment, you have to draw boundary on ownership when it comes to enforcing your morals. I can’t tell you what to do with what you own and you can’t do that to me. If we started doing that, no one would get anywhere, because as soon as you force someone to do something, they can force you to do something to cancel it out. The government also has to respect ownership. The reason that parents have to use their resources on kids is because they voluntarily consented to it in order to have parental rights. The reason that the government can take our tax money is that we consent to it by using federal services like roads, police, the justice system, etc. There’s a lot of things people do that I don’t think they should but I can’t control because I have no rights over them. I can’t force rich people to donate money to the poor because it’s not my money. I can’t force people not to say mean things to other people because it’s their voice and they have freedom of speech. So you’re right that people do a lot of things that other people would think they shouldn’t, but that doesn’t mean they can force them to stop.',\n",

       " {'sequence': \" Lol, nobody lost their abortion rights when Democrats were in charge of the relevant institutions. Texans didn't lose abortion rights under Ann Richards, and Americans didn't lose abortion rights when there was a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, either. I'm sorry you're confused, but it was ~~conservatives~~ reactionaries who did both of those things. All you're doing is shifting blame from Republicans, where it belongs, onto Democrats. It's called [Murc's Law](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=murc%27s%20law).   Codification isn't the answer people think it is. A Supreme Court that can overturn a half-century-old precedent can just as easily find a statute unconstitutional. It's what they did in *Shelby County*, it's what they did in *Brnovich*, and it's what they did in *Bruen*.  Americans didn't lose abortion rights because of anything Biden or Democrats did or didn't do. Democrats didn't legislate away anyone's abortion rights. Americans lost their abortion rights because RBG failed to timely retire, and because American voters failed in nearly a decade of elections, which allowed Republicans to take away abortion rights.  If they'd elected a Democratic Senate majority in 2014, which would've let Obama fill Scalia's seat, there would be no Gorsuch. That would've given us a 5-4 liberal majority. They failed again in 2016, electing Trump and a GOP Senate majority instead of Clinton and Democratic majorities, giving us Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. That gave us a 5-4 reactionary majority. Then they failed again in 2018, giving us Barrett, and a 6-3 reactionary majority. Then they did the absolute bare minimum in 2020, electing a razor-thin Democratic margin in the House, and a literal zero-seat margin in the Senate.  There was no reason to codify abortion rights prior to 2017, because any bill that could actually have passed would've offered weaker protections than Roe already provided. It would've been legislating *away* abortion rights! But, to the extent you think it would've been worthwhile (you're wrong), the last chance they had to do so was during the 111th Congress, the first half of Obama's first term. Was there any movement to codify abortion rights back then? No. For the 112th-116th Congresses, it was impossible, because voters made it impossible. And in the 117th Congress, it was theoretically possible, except, as you already pointed out, they don't have the votes to either overcome or abolish the filibuster. Because, again, voters did the bare minimum in 2020. So you claim they could've done it, but then admit they actually couldn't. And, again, it wouldn't actually do what you want it to do in the first place, even if they did have the votes for it. Which they don't.  Losing abortion rights was a forgone conclusion after 2016. It's just that it took another six years to find a case and for that case to work its way to to the Supreme Court. You don't protect abortion rights by sometimes electing Democrats and sometimes electing Republicans, and hoping Democrats can do enough while they're in power to prevent Republicans from undoing it when they're in power. That's not how it works! You protect abortion rights by electing Democrats, at every level of government, in every single election, so Republicans never have an opportunity to take those rights away in the first place. If we'd elected Democratic majorities in 2014, 2016, and 2018, and elected Clinton over Trump, Dobb wouldn't have even been heard in the Supreme Court, and *Roe* and *Casey* would still be good law.   It's called choosing your battles. There is a finite amount of time and resources, and there's an opportunity cost to pursuing a bill that's doomed to fail, in that it means those resources can't be used to pursue another bill that could actually pass instead.   Lol, what did which Republicans do when? Citations needed.   Prove it. Elect all Democrats, and see what happens. Take away all their excuses you think they use. Filibuster becomes irrelevant, parliamentarian becomes irrelevant, the VP breaking ties becomes irrelevant, absences and vacancies become irrelevant. Or hell, try even just electing filibuster- and veto-proof supermajorities in both houses of Congress. Then it won't even matter who wins the presidency, because they'll have the votes to override any President's veto.\",\n",

       " {'sequence': \" But how having people being able to change their minds make a thing unethical?    You made a lot of assumptions tho. First you assumed that the trial will take such long time (the woman may say to want an abortion, clinician propose to her such experiment and then the test is conducted in the same week of her consent exactly to not prolong pregnancy for too long)    The other scenario was to kill it. Are these health issues worse than death? She can still kill it if such health complications are worse than death (making unethical to let the child live), while she can keep it alive atleast if death is worse than some health issue (making abortion more unethical than a clinical experiment). But this is besides the point.  Having the ability to change their mind and then dealing with the consequences of their decisions may not be enough to justify the ban of something. If this was the argument, then abortion also shouldn't be allowed, because similar things can happen with abortion (see the example of a fetus that was supposedly was not viable, but now survive and have its life marked by such event, or the case of a women that didn't know that her baby was sentient at that stage and for this reason decide to take to court her doctors because she it would have rethought about abortion in that case; examples\\xa0 https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8281321/Landmark-legal-bid-force-clinics-tell-women-truth-involved-abortion.html  And https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/MindMoodNews/michigan-woman-claims-doctor-forced-abortion-stop/story%3fid=10809114 -here the doctor may have been forced to terminate the pregnancy due to circumstances; too late for rethinking about it -)    Wait what? Who talked aboug a woman and arrest her? The whole point that we allow this experiment is exactly because we enable complete bodily autonomy to the woman (here the link with abortion) and to give the woman such option that would also benefit a lot of people. If the fetus is mess up by this or have an unhappy life because of the mother decision during pregnancy suck for him (like some other pro-choicer argued here). The will of the mother is above anything, even in circumstances of bad decision making. Its a Zef, not a person. If you donate an organ, such as a kidney, and then you want it back...it is too late to reverse the decision. It doesn't mean that we should do organ transplants and donations just because some situations like this may happen.    Good but the consequences are dictated by your consent not other, you can revoke your consent but if you did something, you did something and you should accept the consequences of that thing.   I can ask you some water and the say i don't want it anymore, but if you put a bit of water on my glass is not your fault.    Previous point. You just accept the consequences of your decisions. Other pro-choice (so far i counted 2) here argue that in both genetic engineering and such situation, if the son or daughter sue the mother for a genetic editing she/he didn't want to or a permanent damage as a result of the mother decision during pregnancy, the mother should have total legal immunity from such accusations as her will is more important. Essentially suck for them (at least some people here have argued)    It is possible for her to change her mind, it is impossible to avoid the consequence of her decision. That was my point. This under your view does not make inheretly abortion unethical. In the previous case, your applied a logic based on the potenial individual that the fetus could have be (i.e. an healthy one). If you really think about it this may be similar in some aspects to the prospective of pro-lifers since they see abortion unethical due to the potential individual that the fetus could have been.   It really depends if you think that death is worse than having some health issues or the contrary (or equal in gravity). In any case you will not came out from it clean. If keeping a fetus with health issues is worse than death, then a woman that decide to keep alive a baby with such health issues instead of kill it is committing a very unethical decision that is worse than doing an abortion. If death is worse than having some health issues, then abortion should be wrong.   That's why i argued that the debate is much more complex than many people think (people just say pro-life or pro-choice without thinking too much to the ethical implications of their opinions in a more greater picture)\",\n",

It’s just a completely different scenario than abortion I don’t see how it’s comparable.   It doesn’t apply to pregnant women because sex=pregnancy. That’s it. That’s what sex is for on a basic level. We have sex for fun sure but we know the risk. And that risk is a chance we take. And remember I’m arguing for the idea that you SHOULD have a chance in early term to abort just not after a certain period of time. But not based on body autonomy, based on this life isn’t even a life yet. I think body autonomy is irrelevant in this situation. I’m not gonna be an absolutist for body autonomy and say that every scenario should be the same. I think you chose to do something with the risk of bringing a child into the world and you should take responsibility for it. If you can’t abort it when it’s not formed then you should take responsibility for that now formed child just as you would if it was outside of the womb.   I’m not gonna sit here and try to say that you getting hurt in a car accident should be applied the same way as abortion. It’s hurting my head even trying to compare the two.  I think early term abortion you can compare and same with medical problems in pregnancies because yes you should have access to basic healthcare. But having late term abortions, there’s now a developed child involved that has to be taken into consideration and the abortion isn’t required. If a doctor has to pop your arm back in place after an accident there’s really no downside to that. With an abortion you’re aborting a whole child',\n",
