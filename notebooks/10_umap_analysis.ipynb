Although views on abortion aren\\'t that significantly split by gender, a lot of the language around abortion is framed as a \"\"them\"\" problem, not an \"\"us\"\" problem.

It does not consider whether or not a woman with a failing pregnancy can receive medical treatment, and how even if treatment is legal doctors may be pressured into inaction for fear of losing their licenses or being prosecuted; \"\"risk to the mother\\'s life\"\" is often defined very narrowly. It does not consider whether or not a woman with an unwanted pregnancy can undergo cancer treatment. Even when there is an exception for rape or incest, it does not consider how that might require formal charges that cannot be brought and evidence that does not exist. Of course it does not consider the impact of undergoing irreversible physiological changes and losing bodily autonomy, because to prioritize the rights of the unborn, you must conclude that pregnant women do not have bodily autonomy.   It does not consider how the history of abortion rights is riddled with the unnecessary deaths of desperate women.  Pro-life people tend to think these problems are _gotchas_, and not material realities. That\\'s the consequence of conceiving abortion as murder: all else becomes secondary to the moral impetus to prevent it, regardless of the harm it might cause. Just collateral damage. I believe it\\'s much easier to write them off when you believe there is no risk they will happen to you, when an unplanned pregnancy is someone else\\'s problem. When you can assume that the people who have unplanned pregnancies fit a specific degenerate social profile, a la Reagan\\'s welfare queens.

That is, what constitutes *human* vs *a human*, and your personal beliefs regarding consciousness.  There are a myriad of other things to consider on the subject of morality, but most people don’t like or understand nuance.  I *mostly* agree with Rothbard on this one.  “Most discussion of the issue bogs down in minutiae about when human life begins, when or if the fetus can be considered to be alive, etc. All this is really irrelevant to the issue of the legality (again, not necessarily the morality) of abortion. The Catholic antiabortionist, for example, declares that all that he wants for the fetus is the rights of any human being—i.e., the right not to be murdered. But there is more involved here, and this is the crucial consideration. If we are to treat the fetus as having the same rights as humans, then let us ask: What human has the right to remain, unbidden, as an unwanted parasite within some other human being’s body? This is the nub of the issue: the absolute right of every person and hence every woman, to the ownership of her own body. What the mother is doing in an abortion is causing an unwanted entity within her body to be ejected from it: If the fetus dies, this does not rebut the point that no being has a right to live, unbidden, as a parasite within or upon some person’s body.  The common retort that the mother either originally wanted or at least was responsible for placing the fetus within her body is, again, beside the point. Even in the stronger case where the mother originally wanted the child, the mother, as the property owner in her own body, has the right to change her mind and to eject it.”  Edit: first quote for Rothbard',\n",

If this is the case, and one’s argument against abortion is based on consciousness, there is no difference between termination of human life at any stage for any reason, cutting down trees, and turning rocks into roads.']},\n",

By the mid-third trimester, however, the baby is able to appreciate a full range of sensations, including heat, cold, pressure, and pain in every part of the body.”   All a zygote is, is a fertilized egg. So that would mean that you believe taking plan b pills is murder, since plan b pills may prevent implantation and causes zygotes to be expelled.

Do you understand what a zygote is? It’s a fertilized egg. When the sperm enters the vagina, it travels up to the uterus and into the Fallopian tubes, **where fertilization of an unimplanted egg occurs.**  Sometime after fertilization, the zygote implants into the uterus. That means that taking a plan b pill or anything that causes your period can **potentially expel a zygote.**   The study that they cite admits that fetuses probably don’t feel pain in the same way we conceptualize pain since they don’t have the parts of the brain we use to understand we are in pain.   I’d like to ask though, how much pain does an abortion cause? Considering the underdeveloped state of a fetuses ability to sense pain, I highly doubt the pain experienced in an 13 week or later abortion compares to the pain experienced by childbirth. Especially since the fetus at that stage doesn’t have a mind developed enough to think about their pain.  Plus, the pain caused to the fetus is kinda irrelevant, anyway.

The argument I've been told that doesn't make for religion or external morality defines it as a human life the instant a unique human DNA code is created.  It's not my belief, but it's logically sound and not tied to morality or religion.   Manslaughter requires negligence or intent to cause harm.  I know plenty of people who lean pro life who would absolutely be fine with a pregnant mother being tried for manslaughter if she drank and smoked and did cocaine and a doctor thought that was the cause.  I'm not in that camp, but it is a logically sound argument.   It could, and I'm fairly sure without a cultural norm of where that line is, there will never been any agreement on abortion because the whole argument becomes a shouting match when it's based on assumed axioms that are askew with each person.   In those cases, no unique human DNA code exists, and that's the line staunch pro life people take.  No one believes that could be criminal, even among the most extreme pro life crowd.

To them that unique genetic code is a true human life.  I don't agree with that.  I set the line to viability outside of the womb, but they don't.  I'm mostly trying to help people understand the average pro life mentality because with it being a matter of law rather than constitutional now makes it more important than ever to be able to advocate for women by changing people's minds, and to do that, you need to know what the moderates of the other side believe.\",\n",
       "   \"   I don't think the knowledge of how it works is a requirement to use it as an argument.  I don't know the ins and outs of E=MC², but I can tell you details about how that can be used to make a bomb or power plant.  It is probably a reverse justification for a moral perspective, but I think saying it's because of the Bible is wrong.  The bible has details about abortifacients as well as talks of the quickening when the spark of life is breathed into the new life.  It's just where they draw their line and as we understand life more, they've evolved how they define their moral line.    The fact that cancer is defined as cancer and refers to specific mutations that are incapable of achieving sentience makes those genomes definitionally not human.  As for artificial life, it's a moral question I love to geek out on.  I assume the pro life would view artificial life is not human.  I would side with them there, but I also believe what we know as human rights are actually the rights of all sentient or sapient life.   I view it as a moral line that has logical explanation which has evolved with our understanding of biology to be explained in different ways.  The answers I'm giving are things I've been told by asking open ended questions to people who do believe that.  I get the impression most pro choice people only feel that way about their arguments because they get the pro choice perspective from cherry picked extremists or pro choice people speaking for them in bad faith.    I don't see how anchoring their arguments into precise terms makes it illogical.  I don't think anyone is actually rational on this topic because it's about morality and much of morality is just feelings justified with facts and framing that back them up.   I think it's a pretty based view, I just disagree on the grounds that I think it's irrelevant if it's a life or not.  I know I'll never change their feelings and morality because their arguments and perspectives are actually internally consistent, so I like to go with analogies to my morality on bodily autonomy.  I can agree with them that it is a human life and argue that no human has rights to another's body.  If I hit you with my car, meaning I created the situation, I cannot be compelled to give my blood to save your life.  I'm this way, a woman can not be compelled to give of her body to a life she helped create.  Additionally, if a person's child with die without a transfusion, the parents will be morally scorned for not donating blood to their child if possible, but they are not held criminally liable because they have a right to bodily autonomy.  With all of this set, I do agree that the removal of the embryo, fetus, or infant which will end its life is immoral in my moral framework, but unless you kill it to do so when it could survive otherwise it violates no one's rights.  I'm completely okay with having the option for people to take actions I find immoral as long as it is legal and not infringing upon rights.  I've seen such discussion shift line some pro life people hold.\",\n",

You'll never change someone's mind by attacking your spin on their beliefs.  You have to validate places they're logical and question their blind spots while explaining your perspective.    The biggest risk is engaging in good faith like that requires you to be ready to change your opinions.  It did mine.  I used to argue that an early abortion doesn't lead to the end of a human life.  Now I argue it does end a human life but there are plenty of places, such as self defense, or not providing medical care (as a layman) that does result in a human life ending and it is your right to choose that option, and I view abortion through that lense now.\",\n",

This is an argument that makes suggestions based on real information in reality.  This also ignores the rights of the pregnant woman, who is 100% alive with no debate. Most arguments made against abortion in good faith fail at this point because it doesn't make sense to let the rights of a theoretical life trump the rights of a living person.\",\n",

And sure, I think abortion, to an extent, should be one of the tools to deal with that but let’s not be disingenuous here - there are many other tools to do that, the sky isn’t falling, and there has to be some point where we acknowledge personal responsibility and basic biology.

Because at some point people need to grow up and realize they’re not children anymore. Actions have consequences, and causes have effects. This is one of the main reasons why, aside from free market economics, I am not a LibLeft - this libertine fantasy of hedonism without responsibility *is* degeneracy.   I’m in favor of abortion to an extent because I think it’s philosophically dubious to denote personhood to a fetus in those first few months and because I think it’s prudent to be a bit of a utilitarian on this issue. But someone with your position, that personal responsibility shouldn’t matter - why should I believe you care about life *at all*? Have you truly considered the logical endpoint of this type of logical positioning? If personal responsibility shouldn’t enter into the equation, why not legalize infanticide? Babies don’t know what the fuck is going on, don’t know their ass from a hole in the ground, and they’re still wholly dependent on another being for sustenance. In most every dimension that one can diminish the idea of personhood of a fetus into the second trimester and late stages of pregnancy, the same can be said of a birthed baby until, what, the gaining of object permanence and they are weaned off the tit? Clearly, the idea of personal responsibility, the idea of responsibility to a life one has created through acts they know can create that life, has to enter the equation.

But lots of people wrongly perceive these leftist extremists to represent Democrats (again, ask them, they don't like the Democratic Party).  - The Democratic Party is actually mostly moderate nowadays  - Meanwhile, our last Republican president is a conspiracy theorist who attempted to have the results of a legally decided presidential election overturned.  - And for some fucking reason, you don't recognize that this was extraordinarily extremist behavior by the president, along with a huge number of Republican voters who falsely believe the election was stolen   - There are many more examples of extremism by Republicans and if you don't agree, that probably just means you're on the extremist side of things too.  - Given these factors, I think it's obviously ridiculous to argue that the Democrats are more extreme than Republicans.\",\n",

       " 'TheStabbyBrit': {12: ['\"In a sense, this is an accurate statement. If you define marriage as being between a man and a woman, then as long as you allow homosexuals to marry someone of the opposite sex you *are* treating them equally.  Of course, the problem with a gay marriage ban is that marriage has a great many social benefits to it - tax breaks, inheritance rights, etc. and if we were to make an argument based on pragmatism, not emotion, then this is where you would attack gay marriage bans; gay people should be able to form a union that grants them these social benefits and privileges without having to marry someone of the opposite sex.  Now we can consider the following: what harm, if any, is caused by such a change? There is no direct victim - the act of marriage harms no-one. All potential damage caused revolves primarily on religious belief; the idea that the religious sanctity of marriage is undermined. However, freedom of religion includes freedom *from* religion, meaning you cannot impose your faith upon another. In other words, you cannot ban gay marriage because your religion forbids it *unless* it is being conducted in the name of said faith. As most countries now have secular marriage, the religious argument is gone completely. Therefore, there is no valid counterargument against gay marriage.  Now let us consider the trans question. Does allowing a trans woman to compete in women\\'s sports infringe upon any of the ideas we established?  Does it violate the defined social contract? Yes. A woman is an adult human female, and trans women are male. Therefore, banning trans women from women\\'s sports is equal treatment.  What about the pragmatic argument? Men\\'s sports exist, and in some cases the \"\"men\\'s\"\" event isn\\'t actually restricted to men - if you dig into their rules, you will find there isn\\'t actually anything barring women competing in the men\\'s events. This means there is a universal, unisex category (albeit one incorrectly labelled), and so there is no need for trans women to compete as women - they can compete in the unisex event.  Is there harm in allowing trans women to compete as women? In a sense. Women\\'s sports leagues exist because of the biological differences between men and women, and we have seen beyond all reasonable doubt that male athletes can vastly outperform female ones. As such, women only events often exist because without them including women in a team would be a blatant handicap. If women can only compete on equal footing to other women, allowing a trans woman (who is a male) to compete in that space is violating the goal of \\'fairness\\' that underlines the existence of the women\\'s only space.  There is also the violation of freedom of association. People have a right to self segregate. There are limits on this when the goal of that segregation is to provide a public service, but this is typically fine as long as there are equivalent services. In other words, if biological females want to self-segregate, they have that right. By redefining the term \\'woman\\' to include biological males, and then granting said males access to a female-only space, the right to self segregate is violated.

The people working in these clinics are clearly repressing their humanity or potentially evil. Like, how could you do that job and sleep at night otherwise. The way that they are hiding the evidence of what abortion factually is from their patients is pretty unethical. Informed consent is a cornerstone of medical ethics. So, there are 2 people involved in every abortion, 1 cannot give consent, but also cannot survive without the other.  So, we need commonsense abortion control. Restore medical ethics. Educate the mothers on what is happening before they make the choice, bring our laws in line with the rest of the western world regarding time frames. Relax democrats. No right is absolute.  The way her abortions affected her is in line with the study I linked in this thread, it does have mental health risks, emotional trauma is a thing.  So, with emotional trauma, a symptom is to deny the trauma. So she clearly experienced it as traumatic and then started to repress it, the repression went deeper and deeper, she had nightmares and physical symptoms, as did her bf interestingly.  Then she started to deaden her empathy. By the third abortion, it was all about her. Which we see in a lot of the pro choice people, it is all about them, the child doesn't even exist to them, neither does the father matter. All about their rights, no thoughts about others rights.  Once she started working at the clinic, when she saw what she had done, it was probably deeply repressed, she then used drugs to deaden it more and more. I mean those are my thoughts anyway, I could be wrong, have not spoken to her etc.  So, eventually all she could do was work full time repressing the trauma, homeless drug addict etc. She then hit rock bottom. Turned to religion and regained her sanity, was redeemed by christ however you want to interpret that experience.  Every pro choice person should watch this video. Seriously, at least get another perspective. Remember, denial of trauma is a maladaptive coping mechanism that causes mental illness, when someone says they are not traumatized, that doesn't mean its true. Normalizing traumatic experiences such as abortion is common, in some cases this becomes resistance that is externalized and causes people to lash out when they are reminded.  So yea those are my thoughts. Not brain damage, but formation of psychological defense mechanisms that become a collective institutionalized resistance.

I mean, to each their own, but this part of the ideology is never gonna catch me. In fact the fact that LGBT is mixed up with an ideology at all is super 'problematic' to me. By that I mean that people with no ill-will to individuals in the LGBT community are really starting to dislike their advocates.     Well you said objective definitions are impossible. But that's pretty clear. And I was just talking about for statistical purposes. Is a man that never fucks another man gay? We get to Norm's famous joke about being a deeply closeted gay man. If the definitions you want to use are so broad they could apply to everyone, then of what use are they. So men who fuck other men are gay, and men who don't fuck other men are also gay. You know that has already started to annoy gay men, right?    That's not quite as reassuring as you make it sound. That sounds like nearly three quarters of trans identity claims are insincere. That begs the question, how specific is that screening process?    Now this is where I think things get a bit barbaric. You're comparing healthy development through puberty to chemical castration like they're two sides of the same coin. They're just not. And I honestly see a straight line between the underlying belief that there are no objective definitions and this abhorrent moral relativism.      Right, I'm of the opinion that we should be doing our utmost to remove those social pressures and finding more humane methods of treatment for those with extreme dysphoria. Mutilating human bodies cannot be what we want our medicine to be in the 21st century.     Okay this is where using poorly defined terms comes to bite you in the ass. Sex is the biology, gender is the social component, right? Well, why on earth would you need a genital surgery to change a social identity?   I actually think this shows up in some of the statistics. Isn't an affirming family/support group like the most important predictor of mental health for trans people?     I think that should certainly be an avenue of therapy open to anyone, especially adults. Obviously there's a big difference between enjoying intimate time with your bros and halting your puberty and giving yourself permanent infertility along with a raft of other side effects. The two things aren't morally equivalent.   But you're pointing to something reasonable. We used to classify both homosexuality and transsexuality as disorders and before that as crimes.  And they are a deviation from the norm, but not delusions, and obviously not crimes.   So let me ask you this. There are people with body identity disorders who feel they need a limb amputated to match their self-identity. There are even some parallels to the findings in that Sapolsky lecture - those that had the procedures were less likely than normal amputees to experience phantom limb sensation. Is it not still preferable to treat someone presenting with that disorder with a 'conversion-therapy' so that they can live their life without a handicap?  Look I'm not talking about trying to convert all the gays and the trans folks to cis-het wierdos like me. I'm just saying that if at all possible, let's avoid doing permanent damage to someone. If there are any treatments that make someone less likely to hurt themselves and those effects are even in the same ballpark as a bottom surgery, then that's far and away the moral winner.    Yea, that's my point. I may be a monster, but I'm honestly okay with every single trans person keeping their genitals intact if it means everyone else does too. In fact even if there really were 0% detransition and regret rates (there are not) and no misdiagnoses, I'd still prefer that people with dysphoria be able to live with the bodies they were born with. It just doesn't seem like the optimal solution for anyone.     We agree here. I'm pretty averse to most cosmetic surgeries all together - some people seem to seek it out as symptom of some kind of body dysmorphia. It's not healthy. Although, there are pretty obvious cases like reconstruction after a mastectomy where it's a nice thing.     Yes, I am clearly prejudiced against medically intervening in the healthy development of young people's bodies. I think if push came to shove, I'm against it for the 99 trans kids too. I'm unapologetically 'transphobic' in that regard.   If someone who's 25 wants to start taking hormones to be a body builder or to just make their body a bit more masculine or feminine to match their self-image, it's a free country and they're adults. Parents, teachers, and doctors doing the same to a child should be a crime.    Thanks again my friend. I did read it. And you have actually done a really good job of laying out some facts I either didn't know or hadn't connected quite right.

Well the simple answer is when those cells aren't a human life. A clump of cancer cells, kill it. The clump of cells that pump blood throughout Jon Doe's body - don't kill that. What is a human but a clump of cells anyway?    If you want to make the philosophical part the issue and not the scientific one. Then the question is: can you morally kill a child you don't want or can't support?  The rest (abortion, induced miscarriage, maybe even birth control and prophylactics) are simply scientific/medical tools to implement that decision. To be fair, these tools let us make ever more nuanced decisions.   Not that I agree, but the religious right's position here is quite coherent. The choice about the kid happens the moment two people choose to do the nasty. Intervention after that is mucking around in morality that should be better left to providence.    My imprecise phrasing aside (lot's to pick apart if you wanted to) - this isn't actually a very hard question for the majority of the US to find consensus on. Chopping up a viable premature baby - definitely not okay. Using condoms - definitely okay. Choose between the certain death of the mother (and likely loss of the fetus) or certain loss of the fetus (and a near certain survival of the mother) - kill the tot and try again. Use pharmacological means to prevent the implantation of a product of rape - plan B pills it is. Family planning by surgical sterilization of consenting adults, especially those with kids - sure let them get the snip or their tubes tied.   There are plenty of cases where it's just really ambiguous - or at least it seems to me reasonable people could have very different views. In those cases, our system is set up so that states and communities can live how they decide. I'm thinking of cases like:  is it okay to terminate upon the discovery of a serious genetic defect in the kid (a lethal defect, a probably lethal one, a mental handicap)? Or the slightly off topic corollary - is it ethical for the state to sterilize the handicapped?  What are the paternal rights wrt the life of their offspring? Is it okay during IVF to selectively implant (and/or terminate multiple implantations) based on genetic traits (eye color, height, sex)? And fairly soon: What about the creation of designer/GM embryos? Is it ethical to use someone's genetic information in your offspring without their consent (I shook a celebrity's hand, got their DNA, and would like to use it in my next round of IVF)?   TLDR - legislation that protects nearly all interventions in the first trimester (especially non-invasive chemical ones and all prophylactics), bans non-life saving interventions in the third trimester, and leaves the grey areas to the states...that shouldn't be impossible to get 60% of the people on board with.   edit: a word, couple typos\",\n",

My personal argument would be that a fetus doesn’t have the machinery for consciousness before the second trimester ends, so it has no human rights beyond that which the mother gives it before that time. After that time, it should be heavily regulated, allowing only for safety of the mother and non-viable fetal defects.

The truth is that the grey area you speak of isn't wants vs. needs, is just risk assessment. A woman learning she's pregnant faces the most complicated process the human body goes through. I think that justifies risk assessment.   The process will 100% cause damage to her body, and *can* kill her. Does she want to risk death? Does she want to take on this damage? The risk also includes her abilities going forward to provide, as well as the complete upheaval of her entire life moving forward. That's a big deal, and worthy of some thought.   Why can't you people let pregnant women do this risk assessment with there own life and body? Well,  because you claim to be concerned about the unborn life. I get that.

Prolife people trying desperately to cling to some semblance of humanity in discussions on the matter all go out the window when you allow the government to be the arbiter of not only the value of human life, but also of liberty and freedom. The constitution was written to prevent that first and foremost.   I often think about the second amendment during these discussions, and how over a hundred people are shot to death every day. Some might say we need our firearms to protect our lives, and even though firearms are used to kill children in schools, that loss of life doesn't mean we should lose our right keep and bear arms. Others agree that the loss of lives does justify the infringement on our right to keep and bear arms. Especially when that right is directly responsible for killing children.

       "   'Some antinatalists (who are anti-birth, see /r/antinatalism ) like [David Benatar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benatar), who wrote the book Better To Have Never Been, are pro-abortion, arguing it is always morally wrong to create more sentient beings. Benatar believes procreation is the root of all evil. Benatar argues abortion is morally obligatory before sentience develops at 28 weeks (but he doesn’t insist it should be legally mandatory). He says coming into existence is always a harm because life leaves someone vulnerable to every harm, and he uses asymmetries to argue his point: “there is such a thing as chronic pain but no such thing as chronic pleasure; and the worst pains are worse than the best pleasures are good.” Or “we do not feel sadness by the fact that on some deserted island or planet people did not come into existence and are not happy.”  They argue that people who are pro-birth have the immoral position. Basically because everyone will suffer, and everyone will die. So by being pro-birth, they are simply creating more suffering and more death. Another way of saying it: How can someone morally drag an innocent child into the world without its consent, while knowing about the harms and dangers and evil and inevitable lack and deprivation and pain and suffering and death that exist in the world? [These](https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Antinatalism) are other quotes by antinatalists. And I think they’re helpful to refer to, when pro-lifers (actually pro-birthers) insist they have the moral high ground. Alito’s draft opinion says abortion ends a life, but *all* procreation also ends a life, because everyone conceived will eventually die. People can’t create a life without simultaneously creating a death, because every life will inevitably end in death. But even if someone follows Jesus, Jesus had no children. And in Ecclesiastes chapter 4 it says those who have never been born are better off than the living or the dead because they have not seen all the evil that is done under the sun, an example of antinatalism in the Old Testament.',\n",
       "   '\" Find me one baby who asked to be born. You can\\'t. Nobody asked to be born. Nobody consents to being aborted, but nobody consents to being born either. Nobody consented to existence before they were forced to exist by two people fucking one day. And things like suicide demonstrate that many people no longer consent to existence. After conception, mortality is forced on someone, mortality is imposed on someone, life and aging and decay and suffering and death are forced on someone without their consent. I think it\\'s immoral to harm others without consent, just like you would probably think it\\'s immoral for someone to shoot you in the stomach without your consent. A fetus can be the product of rape or incest, unwanted pregnancies are the result of non-consensual fertilization, a fetus can even kill a mother in childbirth. So gun owners who believe in self-defense should at least think abortion should be legal for self-defense. If a fetus is a person, that person can kill a mother during or after childbirth. The Bible doesn\\'t consider abortion to be murder, killing a woman\\'s unborn baby was penalized with a fine, as if it\\'s the mother\\'s property. Numbers chapter 5 contains instructions on how to abort a bastard child. Ecclesiastes chapter 4 says those who have never been born are better off than the living since they have not seen all the evil that is done under the sun. I think babies who have never been born are certainly better off than 10-year-olds shot by AR-15\\'s at close range in a 4th grade classroom. Even if someone is horrified or morally repulsed by abortion, I think they\\'d have to agree that dying from a gunshot wound is worse. The Founding Fathers knew about abortion and they didn\\'t grant fetuses the same rights as others (it\\'s not as if they owned land or anything). Ben Franklin included an abortion recipe in a math book. Why would the Founding Fathers give more rights to a fetus than black slaves which were owned by at least 12 US Presidents?  Everybody is born without consent, everybody suffers and everybody dies. Babies are literally dragged kicking and screaming into this world. If life is the \"\"gift\"\" that pro-lifers say it is, then why do babies cry? Those aren\\'t tears of joy, those are tears of sorrow. Denying their feelings or ignoring their feelings doesn\\'t change the fact that two people forced those negative experiences on someone else. And much of the time spent by parents after a child is born is trying to comfort a child who is now experiencing all the lack and deprivation implicit in being a mortal animal who can only survive in a certain temperature range and a certain oxygen level, who needs so many calories to keep living, who needs certain essential vitamins and minerals to keep living, etc. Arthur Schopenhauer said if life was good in and of itself, then boredom would not exist, since what is boredom but the feeling of the emptiness of life?  Pro-lifers like Alito say abortion ends an innocent life, but what pro-lifers ignore is that ALL procreation ends an innocent life, because when you create a life you simultaneously create a death that never would have happened if not for conception. Jesus wasn\\'t married, Jesus had no children, Jesus never condemned abortion, and when an angry mob wanted to stone a woman to death for having sex outside marriage, he said let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Pro-lifers act like they have the moral high ground, but they don\\'t. Biological parents are not guiltless (Martin Luther, the father of the Protestant Reformation, said there is sin in procreation). It\\'s immoral for a madman to kill a child in a school shooting, but parents throw children blindly into a chaotic dangerous world, knowing full well of the harms and dangers and pain and suffering and evil this world contains (although it\\'s reasonable for parents to expect that their children won\\'t be shot dead inside school). Biological parents endanger an innocent child by throwing them into an evil world. David Benatar said \"\"It is curious that while good people go to great lengths to spare their children from suffering, few of them seem to notice that the one (and only) guaranteed way to prevent all the suffering of their children is not to bring those children into existence in the first place.\"\" A pregnant 12-year-old girl who was raped and impregnated by her father who aborts her baby, has killed less human beings, than a married Catholic couple who never use contraception and had 12 children (who will all die one day). If pro-lifers didn\\'t want babies to die, then they would insist that babies were never conceived in the first place. But they can\\'t be pro-birth without also being pro-death, because every birth ends in death. That doesn\\'t give people the right to kill others, but a mother taking a pill or choosing to have a doctor cut an umbilical cord while a fetus is in the womb is a bit different than a 10-year-old being shot by an AR-15 in a 4th grade classroom, and their classmate rubbing the blood spilling out of their body on themselves in order to play dead and survive a lunatic who couldn\\'t be trusted with firearms. Guns are babykillers, but pro-life pro-gun Republicans conveniently ignore that. How can anyone hate abortion but love guns? Gun deaths are basically late late late-term abortions. Someone can\\'t be pro-life and pro-gun because guns are made to end lives. Someone can\\'t be pro-life and pro-death-penalty, because the death penalty is designed to end lives. Republican politicians can\\'t oppose the killing of children by banning abortion, while doing nothing about the killing of children in school shootings. If Republicans think banning guns won\\'t solve anything, why do they think banning abortion will? Banning something just forces it into an unregulated black market.   As for Ukraine, which is a warzone because of one madman Putin, there\\'s a reason politicians in Ukraine were begging for a no-fly zone or fighter jets, because small arms (which the NRA exists to sell more of in America) are useless against missiles or mortar shells or cluster bombs. The US government has supplied tons of military aid to Ukraine, anti-tank missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and the 2nd Amendment doesn\\'t mean Joe Maniac should be able to legally purchase surface-to-air missiles in Walmart, there should be a limit to which people are trusted with which weapons, especially during peacetime, if you can really call America in 2022 at peace. Instead, mentally deranged people having quick and easy legal access to guns is turning everywhere in America into a warzone: elementary schools, high schools, colleges, hospitals, grocery stores, movie theaters, outdoor concerts, churches, synagogues, etc. If Muslim terrorists were killing those Americans we would do something about it. So why is America paralyzed by gun terrorism when it\\'s committed by white male American loners on other innocent Americans?   Gun nuts in America are so afraid of being disarmed (due to rightwing propaganda, and firearm industry marketing bullshit), without realizing there are much more easier ways to kill someone than trying to disarm someone. More indigenous people in North America were killed by diseases like smallpox which they had no immunity do, brought here by whites from Europe, than they were killed by guns. Even during the Civil War, most deaths were due to disease, not guns. Germ warfare is deadlier than guns and ammo. And guns never stopped any virus. Germ warfare never runs out of ammo, because viruses hijack a cell to turn it into a virus factory. Guns never protected anyone against a virus. So if a group wanted to kill you, they\\'d just vaccinate themselves, and unleash a pandemic to kill everyone else. And then guns would likely be used by people to kill themselves to alleviate the suffering of whatever infectious disease they were infected with.  Americans themselves should want to keep guns out of the hands of crazy people. Responsible gun owners should also want to keep guns out of the hands of crazy people, because even responsible gun owners don\\'t have eyes in the back of their head, they can\\'t be everywhere their loved ones are at once, they can be outflanked or outmatched by any wacko who purchased enough guns and ammo to create a surprise warzone. And frankly, anyone who has never experienced a gunshot wound, and anyone who has never lost a loved one to firearms, and anyone who has never survived a mass shooting, and anyone who has never seen up-close firsthand what certain firearms do to the human body, their ignorant opinion on guns means a lot less than those who have. The power to destroy a life with guns is a power that society should only be entrust to sane, lawful people, not insane maniacs.  If buyers had to provide a list of other adult citizens who trust them with guns, vulnerable people could still legally buy guns for self-defense, but deranged loners would have more difficulty finding others who trust them with guns. And if the people on the list who trust the buyer were legally liable for any damages to people or property caused by that gun, then they\\'d really be careful about who they trust to buy guns.\"',\n",

In the Torah in the book of Genesis, God made Adam out of dust, then breathed life into him, suggesting life begins at the first breath, which suggests the soul enters the body at the first breath and leaves the body at the final breath. Based on that religious belief, abortion should be federally legal under freedom of religion under the First Amendment.

A teenage girl who has an abortion after rape has created less death than a pro-life Catholic couple who never use contraception who have 12 children, or grandparents with 50 grandchildren. If death is bad, then nobody should make any babies. If abortion is evil, that’s an acknowledgment that evil exists in this world, so how could it be moral to drag an innocent life into a world full of evil, harm, danger, pain, trauma, and suffering? Even if someone thinks abortion is murder, there are a million worse ways to be murdered outside of the womb. The worst murders happen outside the womb. And outside the womb, being murdered means someone will struggle to breathe. But fetuses don’t breathe, they haven’t used their lungs yet. Every drowning is more painful and traumatic than any abortion. Yet humans drown every day. Every heart attack is more painful and traumatic than any abortion. Every “natural death” is more traumatic than any abortion. By giving birth, parents throw an innocent child into a dangerous chaotic world, and play Russian Roulette with a child’s life. If women or doctors who are involved with abortion are unethical or immoral or evil or criminal, then biological parents are moreso, because the innocent children they drag into this world without their consent will have even more suffering in their lifetime before their death. If abortion is criminalized for ending a human life, then parenthood itself would have to be criminalized for ending a human life too.  [Antinatalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism) is the ethical view that it’s immoral to make children, which means that pro-lifers hold an immoral belief system. Everyone suffers and everyone dies, so the only way to prevent that suffering, prevent that death, is to never conceive in the first place. Jesus had no children, and Jesus never condemned abortion. Everyone who makes a baby kills a baby, because they made a human being subject to mortality. Nobody makes an immortal person. Every conception lights the fuse to a ticking timebomb of unknown length that is someone’s lifetime. If pro-lifers truly wanted to stop abortions, they would mandate vasectomies, or ban non-consensual fertilization, or ban ejaculation, or ban semen, or create a male birth control pill. They would oppose fertilization, but they can’t, because they’re really pro-birth, and every rat is pro-birth, but that doesn’t make it moral. If life is a gift like pro-lifers think it is, then why do babies cry? Is thirst a gift? Is hunger a gift? Is tiredness a gift? Is coldness a gift? Is pain a gift?  Pro-lifers will say they didn’t create a death, they created a life, and it’s the world that killed them. Which is another way of saying they threw an innocent child into a dangerous environment where they could be killed by millions of things. That’s not the ethical position they think it is, child endangerment is unethical, not ethical.',\n",

Protesters can’t just walk in or break into the homes of Supreme Court justices, because again, people have a right to privacy.  Conservatives are supposed to be originalists with the Constitution, so it’s odd that with the 2nd Amendment they feel it’s a living document and “arms” means whatever the hell they want it to mean.

So should we charge all biological parents with felony murder, for causing the death of another human being? As soon as a pregnancy test is positive, you can dig a grave and buy a gravestone, because biological parents already guaranteed a future death. But pro-lifers pat themselves on the back for the lives they create, ignoring those lives will end in death, ignoring that Jesus made zero children.  And banning abortion doesn’t stop abortion, just like banning murder doesn’t stop murder, and banning alcohol doesn’t stop people from producing and selling and drinking alcohol. It just makes it so poor young black women (who get 5x as many abortions as white women) who can’t afford to travel out of state, can’t get safe legal abortions, even in cases of rape or incest, unless someone mails them pills. And if they can’t afford to travel out of state, then they certainly can’t afford to raise a child for 18 years. Rich white women will still be able to get safe legal abortions.  And if there is no right to privacy, which Roe was based on, then I guess that means it’s legal to trespass inside the house of a Supreme Court justice, because apparently there is no Constitutional right to privacy.  Hunger kills children too, but biological parents make more hungry mouths instead of feeding mouths that already go hungry. Pro-lifers could adopt children, but most of them don’t. Pro-lifers could welcome a homeless person into their home as a guest and give them a home, but most of them don’t. Pro-lifers could feed pregnant women or give them money, but most of them don’t.

People have a right to privacy based on the 4th Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure, so people can’t just break into your house or bathroom or bedroom or bathroom stall, they can’t just rip someone’s clothes off in public, people can’t just open your mail, and your personal reproductive system is your own private business.  And everyone who conceives a child ends a human life, because everyone dies eventually. But pro-birthers conveniently ignore the fact that every life and every birth ends in death. Jesus was single, unmarried, and had no children, so he never caused the death of an innocent child like pro-birthers do. Pro-birthers aren’t without sin.

Biological parents play Pilate themselves when they conceive a child and give a death sentence to an innocent. Birth mandates send children to their death, like Romans sent Christians to crucifixion. But what did a baby do to deserve death? Except Adam and Eve partaking of carnal knowledge and forcing children into a mortal world of toil, blood, sweat, tears, suffering, and death? Those are the actions of parents, not the child. No baby asks to be born, they are dragged kicking and screaming into an evil world without their consent.',\n",
       "   'God also killed every firstborn son in Egypt, and killed Lot’s family, and killed everyone on Earth except for the passengers of one boat, and commanded Abraham to murder his own son, so I don’t see how God is pro-life. And someone can’t be pro-life without simultaneously being pro-death, since mortality has existed since Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden, and every mortal life ends in death. If ending a human life is murder, then fertilization is also murder, because it causes the inevitable death of an innocent life, who never asked to be born.  Jesus Christ made no mortal children on Earth with a woman. Jesus Christ didn’t ejaculate into any woman. Jesus had no biological children. And apostles of Jesus said it was better to be unmarried. Even if we are all the spirit children of God, we are not all the genetic biological children of God, otherwise all intercourse would be incest with our brothers and sisters. The mortal body decays and dies, but an eternal spirit would not die. Creating immortal life is one thing, but humans creating mortal life that will end in death harms an innocent child. If harming children is morally wrong then conception is morally wrong.  Jesus said to feed the hungry, not make more hungry people. Jesus said to clothe the naked, not make more naked people. Jesus said to heal the sick, not make more people who can be afflicted by sickness. To make more children with needs while others go needy is to commit the sin of pride, and pride goeth before the fall, and a mother and father’s pride and vanity will lead to the eventual death of their mortal children, who never asked to be born.  Possibly the only apostle of Jesus who was married was Peter. From that how could anyone conclude that Jesus wants men and women to make large families, let alone any child at all?  Ecclesiastes chapter 4 says those who have never been born are better off than the living or the dead because they have not seen all the evil that is done under the sun. Jesus gave no innocent child a death sentence via ejaculation and fertilization via sexual intercourse. Jesus likely died a virgin. Which means he never created a innocent child who could be tortured and crucified like he was.  The idea that people who make children are followers of Christ is laughable. They follow carnal lust, and the result is the death of a child.  Pro-lifers trade orgasms for obituaries. Jesus did no such thing.',\n",

So in their mind it can’t be the gun’s fault, it can’t be men’s fault, since *they* own a gun and *they* haven’t committed a mass shooting. So they have to blame something else.

       "   'You can understand social conservatives better once you realize many of their beliefs stem from being pro-birth. Abortion is not pro-birth. Homosexuality is not pro-birth, since humans are made by heterosexual reproduction. Masturbation to pornography is not pro-birth. Women in the workforce is not pro-birth. Contraception is not pro-birth. Anal sex is not pro-birth. Etc. They attack and ridicule and mock things and people that are not pro-birth because they believe the purpose of life is to make more people, not total hedonism. So they say liberals are trying to destroy the traditional nuclear family. They believe the rights of heterosexual parents are more important than the rights of “selfish” childless hedonists.  Conservatives believe homosexuality is morally wrong, immoral, evil (because each human is made by heterosexual reproduction, a father and a mother, that is usual), although support for gay marriage has increased over the years because the sky didn’t fall. At best they think an unusual pairing is a waste of resources, at worst they think it’s evil. If you think something is evil, you don’t say “not my thing, but you do you” or “Live and let Hitler live.” You say “Hitler must be stopped, Hitler must be destroyed.” Morality is a matter of right and wrong, good and evil, not a matter of taste. Rightwing authoritarians believe society needs a strong fighter who will do whatever it takes to protect society from evil invading it.  By demonizing things that are not pro-birth, they’re not trying to be happy, and they’re not trying to fix anything but what they see as a breakdown of morality and breakdown of order in society and a degeneration into pointless wasteful activities that are not pro-birth. A moral code only has authority if the rules apply to everyone, so they apply their moral systems on everyone, conservatives or liberals do this. People are arguing over the proper way to live, and conservatives typically think God is on their side.  If someone thinks murder is evil, they can’t say “Don’t murder if you don’t want to.” They say “Nobody should ever murder, because murder is wrong.”'],\n",

If you aren't legally compelled to do something, you can choose not to do it.     If women are not required to modify their body to provide a safe environment for gestation, then obviously they can choose not to do so by withholding the hormones that cause these physical changes to take place and result in the termination of pregnancy.

Not much different than if I found you in the middle of the street in cardiac arrest and began CPR.    In both situations one person through their own physical labor is preventing someone from dying.  So what happens if I get tired and stop?  Did I murder you?

As for the SC cases, the same court that ruled in Roe ruled in those cases.  Consent to the risks is consent to the consequences.  Pro lifers put partisan ideologues on the court so that they would legislate from the bench and overturn precedent, fully knowing that these judges would sit for 30+ years and make hundreds of other rulings.  Every single pro lifer judged the consequences of hundreds of bad decisions to be worth overturning Roe.  Which means, that they decided that black votes don't matter.  Innocence is not enough.

A small percentage of the population is having a lot of sex, you’ve got an unreasonably large population that’s perpetually single and or virgins and record low marriage rates. This is not healthy. Hookup culture exists because not only do you have birth control, if you live in the state with abortion for any reason you can have no consequences from having sex apart from STDs. This is not healthy. People are suffering from mental illnesses like anxiety and depression at high rates and the above cannot be excused as a contributing factors.   I’ve literally not once said we should outlaw all abortion. The overall rate should decrease even more by states outlawing anything unnecessary and prosecuting illegal backalley abortions instate so that no woman dies to a backalley abortion. There will always be states with legal abortions for any reason, and more states with medical reasons for abortion. There will always be employers and charities that will help with interstate travel, as well as friends and family and movement between states is a constitutional right, and a state cannot prosecute someone for doing something in a different state. So how will this increase deaths of women?  No one’s forcing them to not put the children up for adoption if the child is unwanted. They do not need to stay in abusive or unwanted homes. Safe drop off points exist even now. There are extensive waiting lists to adopt children from inside the USA, that have background checks and they want to raise a child.   How do you know that data isn’t corrupted and abortions haven’t just been decreasing solely just because of legal accessibility to them. How do you know it’s not because a higher percentage of the population is not having sex at all compared to 45 years ago, lower marriage rates and issues with fertility in the population, people being less agreeable that abortion is a viable medical procedure or over the past 45 years birth control has been more readily accessible including more people getting their tubes ties and vasectomies and movements like childfree and antinatalism.  I’m completely understanding of how someone that doesn’t see abortion as murder would find this ruling abhorrent. I’ve never once argued for federal abortion bans so the country goes back to coat hanger abortions and the like. I had to help my friend at 14 when she got pregnant by her much older boyfriend who lied as said she wouldn’t get pregnant and she couldnt tell her parents. I was a premature and very sick baby that spent my first days in a NICU and if modern technology had existed doctors may have convinced her to abort me. From my point of view tens of millions of innocent lives were taken unnecessarily because people don’t think about their actions. Or how distressing it is to see pictures and videos of legal abortions across different stages of development.  Have you ever seen a second term baby flail as it’s cut into?. Or videos of women bragging on video that they’ve had so many abortions they can’t count on two hands, or just this week protestors and preachers being assaulted and pepper sprayed just for speaking against marches for abortion. Even with all that I’m still willing to say that there are times when abortions should be able to be performed. I don’t think you even try and fathom what it’s like from my point of view.  Some woman do have the capacity to flip a switch and love the child after giving birth, there are plenty of stories who where going to put their child up for adoption and then refused to give the baby away. Doesn’t mean it happens in all cases. One of my girlfriends mom tried to drown her in the bathtub days after happily giving birth due to post partum disorder. Weird things happen surrounding the birth. But again you make broad assumptions over and over and because I’m a pro lifer I must think this and that. Never once have I said oh you’re just like all the pro choicers and want everyone to get 8 month abortions whenever they like. The way you argue is tiring.

The joining of haploid gametes to produce a diploid zygote is a common feature in the sexual reproduction of all organisms except bacteria.  ](https://www.britannica.com/science/zygote)  The human life cycle begins there. A new and unique set of DNA that the individual will carry until **death**, be it in the womb, to ripe old age, or anywhere in between. The end of any human **life** is, and should be, a big deal. Be it abortion, assisted suicide, suicide, war, death penalty, self defense, murder etc.  To abort a pregnancy is to cause the ending of a human life. Since I am a human, I care about my species and the death of a young one being more tragic since they are so fragile and should be of upmost importance. Therefore, logically, I am “pro-life”. I choose to err on the side that supports humans right to live.   I could keep going, but I don’t want to right a book of all encompassing and related morals, and how that can be balanced with the American ideals of freedom. Nor do I want to go into the details of how my views can find compromises with others who are opposed to my view thus finding an agreeable middle ground for the sake of peace.  However, I’d like to add one final thing.    You seem to suggest that the only reason to be against abortion is that human life has zero intrinsic value to ourselves.

Foetuses born around that time have a better than 75% rate of survival in that jurisdiction.  Is it really justified?',\n",
       "   'So why extend it to 26 weeks then?  It’s available until term under the same legislation if supported by two medical professionals.  Presumably this is for medical reasons (risk to the woman’s health or the baby being brain dead or terribly deformed).  So why extend the unrestricted period?  As I said, it seems that a significant number of feminist activists (on this issue anyway) what no restriction at all on abortion.  I suspect this may ultimately prove to be overreach and actually ultimately risk legal abortion itself (outside the US anyway).',\n",
       "   'Exactly.  It’s a false equivalence.  The trouble is that the closest equivalence to abortion for men is being compelled to pay child support for a kid you don’t see and have no say over.  And no way do feminists want to put the spotlight on that one, as it’s reality!',\n",
       "   'Ok it seems I was under the misapprehension it had already been extended to 26 weeks.  It seems as if it is still 24 weeks.  See here:  https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/abortion-in-victoria  Nonetheless, it is still a 6 month abortion with no restrictions.  This is not to allow for aborting unviable foetuses; or for medical risks to the woman - they’re covered by the two doctor rule.   The limit was set with consultation with feminist groups, who’d clearly pushed for the later limit.',\n",
       "   'You need to reconsider what you just wrote.    Abortion is NOT the equivalent of the snip.  Tubal litigation is.  And Roe vs Wade has nothing to say about that.  It was a decision on abortion, not sterilisation.  And the “spilling seed” stuff is just reaching for it.  As “best interests of the child”.  Are you seriously going to tell me it’s in a “child’s best interests” to be aborted?  LOL.    If a woman goes out to a nightclub for sex, or lies to her boyfriend about being on contraception, and discovers she’s pregnant, she can have the following options: have the baby; abortion (medical or medicinal); give the child up for adoption.  One of the main phrases used by pro-abortion feminists (after “my body, my choice”) is “consent to sex is not consent to parenthood”.  But apparently that only applies to women.  If you’re a man, consent to sex means you’re 100% financially responsible for any child that may result, and this is totally on the whim of the woman.    This is not some exhusband not supporting his own kids (although US law in this area is very unfair).  There are clear cases where men are forced to pay child support where a woman has named them as the father to go on welfare.  In some cases at least, he wasn’t the actual father  The proposal is the so-called “paper abortion”.  This would be an “opt out” period, equivalent to the available time for a woman to have an abortion.  He’d have to be there informed, and would have to give notice in sufficient time for her to still be able to opt for an abortion (so it would depend on the limits placed in the jurisdiction for abortion).',\n",
       "   'And when the man can opt out of fatherhood and it’s financial responsibility, there is “no child” either.  The proposal is that he can do this in roughly the same timeframe a woman can choose to have an abortion (I’d make it a little less, so her decision to have an abortion can be informed by this).    But nice to see your “rights for me but not for thee” line.  And you kid yourself that you’re a champion of equality.  The truth is you want women to know that if they decide to have a baby, some man will be on the hook for it.  You want to maximise women’s reproductive rights, and minimise them for men (opting for sterilisation was your “suggestion”).  If you don’t like the label, I suggest you have a good long, hard think about what you’ve said.',\n",

And I love the way you push SCOTUS as somehow proving that it’s women who have no rights.  Plenty of the feminists losing their block over that were utterly opposed to the whole idea of the so-called “paper abortion”: “rights for me, but not for thee” because, well, it’s “different” and it’s all about “the best interests of the child” (as if it’s in a child’s best interest to be aborted).    The other thing is that the SCOTUS ruling does not ban abortion.  It simply means that the SCOTUS interpretation of the Constitution doesn’t override state laws anymore.  Plenty of states have explicit laws legalising abortion.  That’s how abortion works in most parts of the world.  And why you shouldn’t rely on judicial activism for things that should be addressed by the legislature.',\n",

And it’s the State laws that will make abortion illegal.  And those states tend to have smaller populations, with the notable exception of Texas (which had already effectively banned abortion by imposing a very restrictive time limit).  Most American women live in jurisdictions that explicitly legalise abortion, or at least are unlikely to ban it.  Three: what are you talking about?  Abortion was legalised in New York State in 1970, which is before Roe v Wade.  In fact they passed legislation in 2019 to explicitly legalise unrestricted abortion up to 24 weeks of gestation, with it available after that on medical grounds.  Don’t believe me?

The state of Victoria allows for unrestricted abortions to 24 weeks (as does New York State) and those born at that time have a 75% survival rate.    Let’s not shy away from what is sometimes pushed as “women’s rights”.  When a woman finds out that she’s pregnant, what’s developing rapidly goes from a “clutch of cells” to something that is recognisably a baby.  Let’s just accept that she has a short window to decide to abort.  I think 24 weeks is too long.  In fact if abortion is to be legal, the median gestation age of viability has to be the latest point for a non-medical abortion.

       "  12: ['\"Okay, here are your answers:     **About Desantis &amp; the LGBT+ community**  I live north of San Francisco in one of  the gayest communities in the world. Can you explain to me why every LGBT+ I know is shifting to vote Republican? Are they are homophobic? What\\'s the deal there?     To you all Republicans fit one stereotype-- evil, racist, greedy, homophobic...I\\'m sure I could go on for a while. But every person is different. We have free will, and can come to our own conclusions.      DeSantis signed a bill that the state legislature drafted, and the state congress passed, that expressed the will of the people of his state. Regardless of how you feel about the bill...he\\'s doing his job.      Remember when the media vilified Florida for the Don\\'t Say Gay bill? I went and read it. It\\'s eight pages long, and took like 25 minutes. It doesn\\'t say gay. It says don\\'t teach kindergarteners about masturbation.     One week after it was passed the first teacher was charged with doing exactly that. Are you okay with 5 year olds learning about masturbation in public school? Because if you are, then you are a pedophile.         **About GOP Being Fascist**     Which party controls the media, entertainment, education, the house, the senate, and the White House? But republicans are fascist.     When the election happened do you know what Facebook did to my account? I am friends with people on the right and left. They locked down my account the day before the election due to \"\"suspicious activity\"\". I can see the log. No new ads had been created.      They shut down anyone they thought might advertise for trump. Dozens of my fellow authors were hit. Mysteriously the day after the election our accounts were reinstated, and no evidence was ever provided, or explanation given.     That is some Orwellian shit, and it terrified me. I was a loud Democrat at the time.   One side is intolerant. One side uses terms like fascist, racist, bigot, misogynist, as blanket statements to describe tens of millions of people. Big tech supports the democrats. When did democrats start supporting rich corporations? Were you around for Occupy Wall Street?     Twitter has been outted as a political experiment. 99% of its employees donated to one party. Guess which one? Conservatives have been repeatedly censored, and removed from that platform and every other social media company. If your enemies are being disappeared by our side, then odds are good they are not the fascists.     So you\\'re supporting big tech, big pharma, inflation, war, the firebombing of pregnancy help centers, attacking of police, and countless other heinous acts.   The left literally has their own brownshirts, and the internet is littered with videos seeing people get beat down by Antifa. But it\\'s just an idea right?   **About Trump\\'s COVID Bill versus CARES act**     You can\\'t even go a full post without flip-flopping. I thought the covid relief bill was necessary? Isn\\'t that what you said? So, its bad when Trump does it, but good when Biden does it. Got it.     The vast, vast majority of that bill went to special projects that had nothing to do with infrastructure. How can you excuse it when the other guy does it, but then immediately cook up a justification for your own?     Your side good...other side bad. Guhhhhhh.        **About Friedman &amp; Unions**     Huh, so Friedman is a hack when it proves my point, which you never conceded, still, like 20,000 words into this argument, but when you think he can score points for you, you bring him up.     I am not a republican. You can\\'t brow beat me by saying, \"\"See! See! The GQP are worser!!!! Our side never does anything wrong.\"\" I am not GOP, and I acknowledge that they have positions I disagree with. They just happen to be the lesser of two evils.     Many of the Republicans I currently follow are pro-union. I am a moderate. I pay attention to those people. But don\\'t act like workers aren\\'t getting absolutely fucked under Biden. They know they are, which is why poll numbers completely trash your entirely narrative.        **About Rogan**     I brought up Rogan, because CNN, MSNBC, and many prominent democrats labeled him an alt-right fascist when he is, in fact, a classic liberal just like me. The left smeared him, and hate him. Bill Maher is getting the same treatment.   They use language just like you do as a matter of fact. He\\'s a religious nutcase. He\\'s greedy. He hates women. He\\'s racist. That\\'s the side you want to be associated with.        **About Elections**     The **majority** of the American people will vote out democrats. They will not gerrymander. They will not cheat. Most Americans are done with your bullshit.     The electoral college has kept our nation running for two centuries. If you want to see what happens to a pure democracy, then take a look at how Athens ended. There\\'s a reason we have a representative democracy.      You also said that no republican president had gotten a majority of the vote.   As usual you are full of shit. Only a handful of elections involved a president winning with a minority. Reagan won in a landslide.      There were only two disputes in our lifetime. Al Gore was cheated out of the election in 2000, and Donald Trump won with a minority in 2016.     In 2024 every republican will win with a handy majority. Just yesterday another generational democratic district elected its first Latina, and she\\'s a conservative.    As a gentle reminder, since you know less about politics than you think, local and state elections are popular votes. If someone wins, its because most people want them.        **About Senate Seats**     Yes, California is massive, and larger than many states put together. This is why we have far more seats in the house of representatives than any other state, even though we just lost one because our state is shrinking. That\\'s where bills get passed. This gives us a lot of power.  The senate was designed to prevent the tyranny of mob rule, which is why small states get an equal seat at the table. We get more electoral votes to make up for it.  &amp;#x200B;  **In Conclusion**     Your arguments are weak. Your party is corrupt and in decline. And no matter what REEEEEEEEE comeback you come use next NOTHING WILL CHANGE THAT.     I\\'ve refuted all of your nonsense. You won\\'t be able to touch any of mine, and will instead rage about unrelated shit.     Afghanistan alone should be reason for every American to be upset. We let down the kids we sent to war.

Moreover, it is entirely independent of any specific ethical, moral, political, or religious view of human life or of human embryos.” https://lozierinstitute.org/a-scientific-view-of-when-life-begins/, “Overall, 95% of all biologists affirmed the biological view that a human's life begins at fertilization (5212 out of 5502).” https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703. the second source is extremely informative and lays out in very clear terms what determines the difference between an organism, and a cell of an organism, both of which are alive, but only one is considered to be in itself a life. starting from fertilization, humans are live organisms, capable of differentiating cells and creating organs to support the organism as a whole. it’s determined by a simple evaluation of what a zygote is capable off.\",\n",

What I definitely think is that once the fetus has developed a psyche, choices are over - you can only abort if going on with the pregnancy is a significant threat to your own life.\",\n",

Are you saying that birth control failure is rape? What does incest have to do with this? Miscarriage is a completely different issue, quite the opposite of what we are discussing.   I didn't say that? Everyone is free to do what they want, but the consequences are on them.   The one I didn't make?\",\n",
       "   \"Yeah I know. I just don't think it's high enough for blanket termination.  Consider haemophilia: a healthy carrier mother has 25% chances of having a diseased child and 25% chances of a healthy carrier one. That's pretty high, and yet we don't prevent them from having children and hoping that they are ok.\",\n",
       "   \"Well, you can always give the baby away if you can't/don't want to raise them, but I agree that they won't have an easy life.

       "   \"They are a necessary evil to allow (like you said, before a reasonable deadline except for special cases) for many reasons. The bodily autonomy one doesn't hold water for me because, barring rape, the fetus is there as a result of deliberate actions, not as an invader or sort or something that was imposed from others. Saying that you can just 'evict' it is like accepting someone in your refuge, and then sending them out in the middle of a deadly storm. Also, as I already said, once we accept that bodily autonomy is paramount, nothing stops a mother from aborting a formed, viable child for any crazy reason she may think of.\",\n",

You can probably have better luck arguing with someone who feels morally pro-life, but isn\\'t religiously convinced of the sanctity of a life since its conception. So, what did convince someone like me that abortion is something to accept?  Well, first of all I consider the psyche of a person as what really makes them so. Before it even exists (or when science tells us that it\\'s lost forever), I personally give more value to the actual life of other thinking people than to the mere potential of one. That said, I still value that potential: the loss of it due to simple convenience is a terrible waste, and I\\'d give much more credit to someone who recognizes it as such, than to another who goes: \"\"Haha I just evicted the parasite and I\\'m not gonna stop boasting about it!\"\"  Giving reasonable deadlines (and exceptions) for when you would allow abortion also gives you more chances of being taken into consideration than appealing to principles that could justify killing what is an already formed baby with an active brain, even if still unviable for surviving outside the womb. If I was going to risk supporting a law that allowed that, I would rather err in the other direction.  Accusing people with a different opinion of being evil, assuming that their reason for being pro-life is that they hate women and want to dominate them, isn\\'t going to help your cause. Fathers can (and should, and usually do) get very emotionally involved with their children; telling them that they have to just shut up and accept their termination because it\\'s not their business, is going to push them towards zealotry.  In the end, the moment when people should start having rights is subjective, and it\\'s hard to change someone\\'s opinion about that. The best thing is finding other moderates (which are the majority) and make a reasonable agreement with them. In Europe we don\\'t have such big discussions about abortion because the laws are set and make sense: we don\\'t kill formed babies, but we allow an accessible way out for those who need it. There are people who disagree from both sides of the camp, but they don\\'t get much attention - even the Church, which is of course 100% pro-life, can just preach; we are not going to listen too much unless we are considering the morality of our own decisions. The US just seem to have more extremists (or more vocal ones), and the federal organization messes things even more because you can have places where different ideas are more common and that are generally allowed to make their own laws; preventing them from doing so for abortion is going to meet some backlash. That\\'s a reason why even people who aren\\'t pro-life don\\'t get up in arms about the recent overturning.\"']},\n",

Since then, straight people have treated queerness as a caste in and of itself. In this cultural context, any kind of homosexual or gender-fluid behavior came to identify an individual above all other social markers.   Queer people themselves are not responsible for this. We did not ask to be defined by our sexual preference. But time and time again, we are singled out, disparaged, condemned, and ridiculed for it by heterosexuals. From this treatment, a social identity has emerged.  However, most queer people do not see their sexuality or gender identity as the foremost aspect of their identity. It’s simply one aspect of their personhood, albeit a significant one, that works among many others to shape our life and identity.   tl;dr: queer people are just people. It’s the straight majority that has historically pigeonholed us into a marginalized demographic.',\n",

Being queer is not a lifestyle choice. Being straight is not a lifestyle choice. Nobody chooses their sexuality or gender identity. The only thing we want kids to know is that they will be loved and supported regardless of sexuality or gender presentation. That is all.  3.) Using your religion as an excuse to criticize, malign, disparage, or demonize queer people, then claiming that you don’t care about people’s gender or sexual identity is nothing less than abject hypocrisy. You either accept queer people or you don’t. Your religion is irrelevant.  4.) The age-old conservative argument that we are shoving sexuality in your faces is both false and tedious. Straight people have literally shoved their heterosexuality down my throat my entire life. And you know what? It’s fine because  they are the majority and they have a right to love who they love the same way we do.  5.) Again, pride rallies are not the same as political rallies.

This event represented a tipping point in the queer community and inspired other gay/trans people to stand up and demand equal rights under the law.  Since then, Pride has become a celebration not so much of sex or sexuality itself (though many people outside the community see it as such), but rather a celebration of all the struggles the queer community has overcome across generations of oppression. Despite everything, queer people still exist with our dignity intact.

Not every born person can pump their own blood using their own heart, not every born person can breath for themselves, not every born person can digest food properly, not every born person is viable without assistance, maybe it is another person, who, while not being physically attached is just as necessary for survival, perhaps a life support system, a pace maker etc. Setting viability as the goalpost for humanity is dehumanizing.\"',\n",

Why does it matter if they need physical attachment, it doesn\\'t change the fact that both a ZEF and a six year old require near constant support from other people in order to survive. Why does it matter if it is in the form of physical attachment or external support?   They actually are very similar. Both are humans, both are living, both have unique DNA, both rely on others for survival, just in different ways. The only real differences are location (one is in the womb one is out), level of development (fetus is just a stage in human development as is toddler, child, etc.), and physical attachment, a six year old is not physically attached, a ZEF is.

I\\'m not downplaying anything, I am saying it doesn\\'t matter whether that pregnancy is completely unexpected, unintended and unwanted or if it was the most wanted pregnancy in the world, it doesn\\'t determine the ZEFs value, whether it should get to live or die, how you feel about someone doesn\\'t have any impact on their right to life.   As for non-consensual body use, there is a massive difference between someone choosing to use another\\'s body for their own pleasure and sexual gratification, and someone being forced to use another persons body.  Also, if a ZEF (who has no choice) using the woman\\'s body for survival is bad, is the woman non-consensually doing something to the ZEF (ending it\\'s life) even worse? I mean, she is choosing to, what she is doing is permanent, and unless it is a life threat situation she is not doing it for survival.   I never said they were, being inside of someone is a location. It is not dehumanizing to point out a biological fact, that just shows your complete lack of scientific literacy. A ZEF is \\\\*located\\\\* inside a woman\\'s womb, that is it\\'s location.

If you are pregnant you are sustaining life, if the only way to stop sustaining that life involves taking action that ends the life of another human that is not ok. If the fetus is far enough along that there is another way to stop sustaining life, while not ending the life of the fetus, like inducing early labour that should be offered at no cost to the mother.

       "   '\" I sent two but I am assuming you\\'re referring to the two of them.   Just because the person writing the article has their own opinion doesn\\'t inherently make the article biased. My first article was a list of references, written by a mix of people with different views of abortions, taken from medical journals and scientific studies. The facts in both articles aren\\'t \"\"biased\"\", I would like to see some proof of any type of bias in the works, preferably a quote from either article. It also seems you can agree that life starts at conception.   I care about human life. It is the reason I\\'ll kill a spider and not another person. I don\\'t care about bacteria, or tapeworms, why would I?   Sure it isn\\'t a baby, but it is a person. Please tell me what counts as a person to you? What requirements must be fulfilled. As for it not being able to feel pain, feel, hear, see, smell, until 18-20 weeks, this is false. Here you will find a peer reviewed study on [fetal pain in the first trimester](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00243639211059245). Again, if you are going to call my study biased I will need to see proof, more proof then that the person writing it is pro life, as I don\\'t know if that is the case or not. The first trimester is week 1-12, so long before 18-20 weeks.  You also claimed abortions at weeks 18-20 and onwards only happen due to medical necessity, this is also false. It is debunked [here](https://secularprolife.org/2016/10/no-most-late-term-abortions-are-not_13/). If it is biased I will need more proof than \"\"it is a pro life organisation\"\", if you read the source you can see clearly it uses information from the Guttmacher institute, a pro choice group and the think box for planned parenthood.   I am aware, I used to be very pro choice, I am not pro life because I am ignorant, I am pro life because personhood starts when human life starts.   Ok, both of us agree 9 year olds \\\\*\\\\*should not\\\\*\\\\* be pregnant, and someone clearly needs to be in jail right? Ok, so neither of us are happy with the situation, the only difference between us is how we should deal with the situation she is in, you are pro choice, so presumably you believe she should have to choice to carry to term or have an abortion, correct? I see abortion as killing her child, so I don\\'t believe that should be an option, unless a doctor decides her life is at significant risk.   Apply that logic to anything else. If you believe rape is morally wrong just dont rape, you don\\'t get to dictate what I do with my body. See how that sounds? Eating unhealthy food and risky sports is not comparable, all this goes out the window when it affects another human being. Believe it or not abortion doesn\\'t just effect the fetus. Besides, don\\'t like me \"\"dictating what someone else does with their body\"\", then just don\\'t do it yourself, that\\'s how it works right?   Ok, but abortion isn\\'t \"\"removing a fetus\"\" it\\'s killing it, also either it is a parasite or it isn\\'t, that doesn\\'t change depending on if you want it or not. If you\\'re saying it is a parasite I will need a source for that. I hope you appreciate the irony of \"\"You can\\'t control someone else\\'s life just because it emotionally hurts you.\"\". What do you think abortion is? That is even worse then controlling, it is ending.\"',\n",
       "   \" So we agree there, she shouldn't have a baby because she shouldn't be pregnant in the first place. I don't see how your stance is very different, yours is the same except if she doesn't want to carry to term you're ok with her killing it instead.   Sharing characteristics with something doesn't make you that something, if you are going to call a ZEF a parasite I am going to need a source, don't make claims you can't substantiate with evidence.   No nine year old \\\\*\\\\*Should\\\\*\\\\* carry a baby, no nine year old should kill their own offspring through an abortion either. I don't see how you are all that different, carry a child as a child or kill a child as a child, I would rather choose the scenario where they are both alive, I also don't get why you brought up child rape, a case clearly different to the vast majority, abortion in the case of rape is argument for abortion in the case of rape, not abortion as a whole.  Ok so I don't care about the child because I think if someone gets pregnant they should carry it, but you clearly care about children because you're willing to let her kill it if she wants to? Right...   Just because it doesn't involve your body doesn't make it ok, if I was to assault someone with my body it doesn't hurt your body does it? So why should you and the government step in? I can choose what to do with my body until it hurts someone else or is against the law. Abortion hurts an innocent person. I don't care if the fetus is attached, that doesn't make it less valuable or any less worthy of life. Also, do you believe in limits on abortion? By that I mean, no abortions after 6 or 7 months etc?   So is abortion. Abortion can kill you. Abortion can give you permanent damage and traumatize you.   A fetus is something, to deny that is simply false, it is just as much of a something as you and me. Does she understand what will happen to her in abortion? And like I said, if a doctor agrees she will most likely die then that is the only scenario where abortion is ok, life threats. So you're not even saying the 9 year old should have a choice, you're saying she \\\\*\\\\*should\\\\*\\\\* have an abortion? If so that is not really pro choice, Saying something is gross does not constitute an argument, I could call your position gross all day.   Why not? They are human beings, what else do you have to be to be human. Is it a clump of cells when it has a heartbeat, what about when it has fingernails, arms legs, still a clump of cells then. Also how can you say the aren't at least somewhat sentient after I sent you a source about fetal pain \\\\*in the \\\\*\\\\*first\\\\*\\\\* trimester\\\\*.  Why should how much that person wants it determine it's worth? What other people think of you, any how much they want you should never determine your worth. And yes, you're right, it is not more important than the person carrying it, it is just as important, when we start deciding what human beings lives are more important we have already given up on morality.   I mean it is, it doesn't matter how you see it personally, we are talking about biology, biologically that is your child that you are killing. There are many kids in the world whose mother don't take care of them, want them, protect them or love them, does that mean they actually don't have any mother at all?    Yes it is, it doesn't matter if you want it, it is your child, this is not an opinion this is a fact. Stop calling fetuses parasites unless you can provide a source, and either way, is it a parasite or not, because whether or not something is a parasite is biological, not based on how much you want it. By get rid of it you mean kill your biological living child\",\n",
       "   '\" I am aware, we don\\'t agree. I don\\'t care about any metaphorical human I care equally about the two actual human beings involved, for the record are you saying the nine year old has a choice or she has to have an abortion?   You are aware that happens with abortion to right? And who here claimed she was ready for a baby? Is she ready for an abortion?   I don\\'t see how what I see when I look at a pregnant woman is relevant whatsoever, and yes a fetus is biologically a human, a living human, what else do you have to be, other than a living human, to qualify as a person?

By making that statement, I am not stating that it is not an issue that does not ALSO affect other people who aren’t women, nor that every single woman on Earth is personally going to ever need access to an abortion or that every woman can even get pregnant. Something doesn’t have to only affect women or affect 100% of women or be exclusive to women to be a women’s rights issue.   As an example of what I mean and why I think the backlash goes a little too far sometimes imagine if I said the right to interracially marry is a racial justice issue and someone came and told me I can’t say that it’s a racial justice issue because most people marry their own race and I’m excluding people who don’t want to get married or that I’m excluding people who can’t get married (like back when gay marriage was illegal, or polyamorous couples today) or that by couching it as a racial justice issue I’m excluding/excessively including people in interracial marriages who are white or whatever else.

But if I say an issue affects women if it doesn’t 100% affect all women or it also affects some people who aren’t women then some people who are overly scared of anything that could possibly be interpreted in bad faith in an offensive way will insist it’s offensive to say it’s a women’s issue.',\n",

They literally want to murder us. Corporations handing money to these people is incredible and the gall they have to use our flag is inexcusable.

The police do the bidding of the capital owning class. They\\'re not free agents to act like they want. So its better to address root causes of the oppression capitalism causes than just blame the police, who while at fault for their individual actions, are not the main motivators and producers of this hate.  Honestly, no for-profit organization should be using the rainbow flag. The profit incentive of capitalism guarantees oppression, especially against the most vulnerable like the LGBTQ community, minorities, women, the disabled, immigrants, children, etc. Corporations will always give to the GOP because it pays them back in tax cuts, union-bashing, and attacking workers rights and wages. They are happy to put a boot on our faces forever to save $1. This does not align with LGBTQ values at all.

      "Because its LGBT. Bisexual people don't just swap between being gay and being straight. They are always bisexual.   If you like vanilla and strawberry ice-cream, just because you only eat strawberry ice cream for a week doesn't mean you no longer like vanilla\n",

      "Oh hey good to see biphobia is still alive and well. You are bisexual regardless of your experiences. If you are attracted to both sexes thats all you need.\n",
      "Yeah I see the large amount of LGBT people being because of two possible reasons.   The first is that this survey was conducted under a meme specifically talking about the LGBT flag so the people in the comments would be those who have an interest in LGBT issues enough to go in to the comments and fill out a survey.   The other factor is that people on reddit are likely to be more LGBT than the normal population, partial because they are just younger and partial because of what type of people use reddit.   Or maybe a bunch of people just lied on the survey but considering there were 4000 responses it would have taken real effort to fake that many responses to make this much difference.   Either way if you enjoy talking about the details of stats you should check out /r/PCM_University\n",
      "I mean this subreddit is mostly transphobic but yeah its uncomfortable how much homophobia is still around.

      "\"So there's the obvious thing of gay people, mainly trans people having to face bullying for their identity. Something they can not change in places like school or home. And then reading about communism or anarchism and seeing that both promise an \"\"equal utopia\"\" (the book was written on the 19th century so I doubt it would be very equal now) and they just never bother to actually read into the history of these things. They just see communism = no transphobia despite that not being the case.  Transphobia still exists under anarchism. All destroying the state will do is make all the transphobes make their own nation of extreme transphobia and start to invade and enslave nations with trans acceptance. There's nothing stopping them anymore.  I wouldn't mind the communism if it was like \"\"communism has a history of poor treatment of LGBT and other people but we want to change this\"\" but it isn't that. They just think Mao was this god sent gay loving super being. And it's all just because they don't like the USA.  It's ok to not like the United States. There's a lot of reasons not to like it. But that doesn't mean that you have to decide everything that is from the USA or an allied nation is a lie and propaganda and then only trust the Chinese and Russian side of history. You shouldn't mindlessly trust either side. You should listen to both sides and then find which side the facts support. You can hate the USA and not need to support an even worse dictatorship and lie about what it is doing.\"\n",
      "\"I agree I actually find behaviour like that to be extremely offensive. Imagine being a gay man living in Iran. You know you like men. You fall in love with a man but you can never even utter the word. Because even mentioning the idea of you being gay is enough to get you put in prison.  Imagine being a gay man who had to leave Iran because his basic freedoms and life were in danger to the UK. Where he could marry another man and live a happy life. And even have laws in place to protect him from hate crime. This sounds like a happy story right?   Now imagine him telling this story to some 16 year old twitter girl. And then she just spouts at him with a completely straight face \"\"The UK is Homophobic and Transphobic and is one of the worse places for LGBT rights in the world\"\"  I get it. LGBT rights in the UK ain't perfect, there's still shit we need to sort out. But there's places in the world still where people are dieing for it. This man has literally just escaped from a place where he would have certainly been killed. And was then told with complete confidence that it is better than the country that he moved to in order to live a better life.  These people have no sympathy. They all want to be the next big LGBT rights activist that goes down in the history books. But instead of concentrating on parts of the world where being gay is still criminalised. They just create bullshit arguments that don't exist for countries that already have a lot of the problems sorted out. And will then will try to find a solution for a problem that isn't even there.  Maybe we should stop harrasing fucking J.K Rowling on twitter and acting like her death ends transphobia. And maybe we should actually be going after people like the leader of Hungary. Who not only has the power to oppress gay people. But has used his power to do exactly that. We should be going after the people of who are actually ruining the lives of millions instead of someone who said a mean thing online once that no on listens to.  This is from an asexual transwoman aswell. This people have never sat a history class and haven't seen the world outside of their own county or state and will happily say they are the most knowledgeable person about the entire globe. I hope these people never get any form of political power. If they do it's the literal end of society. You want world war 3? This is how it would start.\"\n"
