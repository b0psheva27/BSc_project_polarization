And most pregnant people do indead have the procedure long before there is a brain, but I do see a potential issue.   From what I've read (especially the many terrible recent situations), tightly regulating abortion, even after a certain number of weeks can potentially backfire against people that have desperate medical needs. I can't say I blame the doctors really, if their hands pretty much become tied and they have to either recieve approval from the hospital board before they can intervene and save the patient, time might be running out for said patient. Same if doctors are put into a situation of uncertainty, that previously hasn't existed (not just doctors, if someone in any job should suddenly fear that their normal actions might land them in prison, or loose ther license, or other such potential consequences), they will now have way more considerations to make aside from just that patient. I don't really know how that could be addressed (if at all) by any of those laws 🤔  But I'm personally not a politician, I can just give my opinions, and maybe what I've learned from others and the stories I've heard of.  Generally speaking, people don't have an intention to harm, and most pregnancies are actually continued, it can be unfortunate when one's body betrays them and who knows, maybe in the future artificial wombs will really be a thing, and this particular debate subject will cease to exist, exist more in a historical context, or the importance of it will have completely changed.

       " {'sequence': \" Lol, nobody lost their abortion rights when Democrats were in charge of the relevant institutions. Texans didn't lose abortion rights under Ann Richards, and Americans didn't lose abortion rights when there was a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, either. I'm sorry you're confused, but it was ~~conservatives~~ reactionaries who did both of those things. All you're doing is shifting blame from Republicans, where it belongs, onto Democrats. It's called [Murc's Law](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=murc%27s%20law).   Codification isn't the answer people think it is. A Supreme Court that can overturn a half-century-old precedent can just as easily find a statute unconstitutional. It's what they did in *Shelby County*, it's what they did in *Brnovich*, and it's what they did in *Bruen*.  Americans didn't lose abortion rights because of anything Biden or Democrats did or didn't do. Democrats didn't legislate away anyone's abortion rights. Americans lost their abortion rights because RBG failed to timely retire, and because American voters failed in nearly a decade of elections, which allowed Republicans to take away abortion rights.  If they'd elected a Democratic Senate majority in 2014, which would've let Obama fill Scalia's seat, there would be no Gorsuch. That would've given us a 5-4 liberal majority. They failed again in 2016, electing Trump and a GOP Senate majority instead of Clinton and Democratic majorities, giving us Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. That gave us a 5-4 reactionary majority. Then they failed again in 2018, giving us Barrett, and a 6-3 reactionary majority. Then they did the absolute bare minimum in 2020, electing a razor-thin Democratic margin in the House, and a literal zero-seat margin in the Senate.  There was no reason to codify abortion rights prior to 2017, because any bill that could actually have passed would've offered weaker protections than Roe already provided. It would've been legislating *away* abortion rights! But, to the extent you think it would've been worthwhile (you're wrong), the last chance they had to do so was during the 111th Congress, the first half of Obama's first term. Was there any movement to codify abortion rights back then? No. For the 112th-116th Congresses, it was impossible, because voters made it impossible. And in the 117th Congress, it was theoretically possible, except, as you already pointed out, they don't have the votes to either overcome or abolish the filibuster. Because, again, voters did the bare minimum in 2020. So you claim they could've done it, but then admit they actually couldn't. And, again, it wouldn't actually do what you want it to do in the first place, even if they did have the votes for it. Which they don't.  Losing abortion rights was a forgone conclusion after 2016. It's just that it took another six years to find a case and for that case to work its way to to the Supreme Court. You don't protect abortion rights by sometimes electing Democrats and sometimes electing Republicans, and hoping Democrats can do enough while they're in power to prevent Republicans from undoing it when they're in power. That's not how it works! You protect abortion rights by electing Democrats, at every level of government, in every single election, so Republicans never have an opportunity to take those rights away in the first place. If we'd elected Democratic majorities in 2014, 2016, and 2018, and elected Clinton over Trump, Dobb wouldn't have even been heard in the Supreme Court, and *Roe* and *Casey* would still be good law.   It's called choosing your battles. There is a finite amount of time and resources, and there's an opportunity cost to pursuing a bill that's doomed to fail, in that it means those resources can't be used to pursue another bill that could actually pass instead.   Lol, what did which Republicans do when? Citations needed.   Prove it. Elect all Democrats, and see what happens. Take away all their excuses you think they use. Filibuster becomes irrelevant, parliamentarian becomes irrelevant, the VP breaking ties becomes irrelevant, absences and vacancies become irrelevant. Or hell, try even just electing filibuster- and veto-proof supermajorities in both houses of Congress. Then it won't even matter who wins the presidency, because they'll have the votes to override any President's veto.\",\n",

       " {'sequence': ' The issue is not pleasant, but it is actually pretty simple to understand.  If the right to life is equal between two people we move to different criteria.  The importance here is that the right to life of every person in the situation has at least been considered.  This only happens when there is a serious threat to life and is the essence of why we allow for life threat exceptions.  It is a consistent part of the pro-life ethic to allow these as both mother and child have the right to life.  It only in that instance does the mother\\'s life become also in danger, as opposed to only that of the child.   Only for choices you have made, and I would argue that in the case of the most basic human rights, you never forfeit them.    Of course, I don\\'t agree with the death penalty either, so it is easy for me to be consistent there.     Here you make the common pro-choice mistake of ignoring the child in the situation, which we are not going to do.  Yes, pregnancy is not 100% safe, but abortion, is 100% fatal to the child.  You are arguing that we should accept a 100% fatality rate for one person to offset a less than 1% fatality rate for someone else.  That just doesn\\'t make any logical sense.   Question all you like, but the AI issue is not pertinent here.  For one thing, there is no such thing as AI yet.  So, it makes little sense to discuss how rights would work with them at this juncture except in the broadest of outlines.  Second, AI would presumably be alive in some fashion.  Any particular AI would need to have a physical existence which it ran on just like any other lifeform or computer.  In that sense, it will have the same physical reality as a human and its own development.  Thirdly, human rights and AI rights are two different things.  Human rights are based on human context.  An AI almost certainly will not have an entirely human context.  Consequently, the sort of rights an AI will find important may be very different from those which humans have.  That is why species is important.  A human has human rights because it is a human organism.  We share a context that is human which is informed by our physical structure and how that interacts with the world.  That is why we can make rules which apply to other humans.    An AI will not be human, by definition.  How that causes an AI to see the world will be different than us.  We can negotiate an understanding between us and AI, but we will always have different needs, and consequently, different views of life.  Just making the argument that we might have \"consciousness\" is not a good basis for rights.  You must holistically understand the context of the organism you are dealing with.     Humanity isn\\'t \"important\" in the sense that we are special.  Humanity is important in that it is how we relate to one another and our environment.  Human rights is the rules we make for ourselves when dealing with ourselves.  And we have the right to do that because we are only putting those obligations on ourselves for things that affect us.  Too many people take the wrong-headed position that it has something to do with humans being special.  That\\'s completely the wrong takeaway.  I don\\'t have to be superior to a dog or an AI to recognize that human organisms have particular needs that dogs or AIs might not have.  Our species, our rules.  There is nothing more to it than that.   I entirely disagree.  I am not requiring that the child be carried to term.  I am not even interested in whether the child lives or dies.  What I am interested in is that you do not kill them.  They don\\'t have a right to be kept alive at all costs, but they do have a right to not be killed.  And I am resolute in the position that you don\\'t have a crystal ball.  You can\\'t tell me that every child ever aborted was always going to have bad life.  Plenty of people survive abuse and shitty parents and turn out to have good, productive and happy lives.    More to the point, I am annoyed that excuse is given for an action that is almost always taken for the sole benefit of the person making it.  How the life goes for the child is just a way of trying to justify to themselves something they were going to do anyway, and pretend that it was all for the best.  It\\'s not all for the best.     Value is irrelevant.  Humans don\\'t have to earn human rights.  Even a \"valueless\" human is entitled to human rights.  Human rights is based on membership, not some sort of earned value.  It is alien to the idea of human rights that you have to demonstrate value to get them.     That makes no sense, though.  You know full well that we make laws all the time which cannot be completely carried out.  Have murder laws ended murder?  Have theft laws ended theft?  Of course not.  We make laws based on the rights of other humans, even if those laws cannot always be completely enforced.  And consider this.  Murder laws don\\'t catch every murderer, but they do catch many.  Abortion bans also won\\'t stop every abortion, but they have and will continue to stop many.  You cannot pretend that we only make convenient to enforce laws.  When it comes to the big issues, most of our laws are very inconvenient to enforce, but we still do it.',\n",

A thing is if it was inherited, a different thing instead is if she willingly did something to affect you in a negative way (like some pro-choice here argued; if you read many comments there are a lot of people that would be against the mother if she is willingly causing harm to the fetus). If a doctor do something wrong to the fetus and you develop an abnormality because of him, there can be legal grounds for took him to court.
