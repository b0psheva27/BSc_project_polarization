Yeah, you get to vote with your dollar, but those with more dollars get more votes. Only the wealthy truly get to impact the outcome of things economically. Sure, I respect anyone who wants to go the extra mile and try to follow these ideals, but people who don\'t should not be shamed even if they are ""hypocritical."" You can advocate for a different society while still participating in the current unethical one. It just means you recognize that larger change needs to happen that does not start with your own individual purchases.    Again, this rhetoric is rooted in individualism. Look at crime, for example. Why does crime happen in urban areas? It has to do with the material conditions, right? Sure, you can look at an individual person and blame them for their actions, but that will not solve the conditions that lead to that group of people in that area as a whole committing more crimes on average.    Kind of, yes. I have a much more positive impact on the environment than any corporation that is dumping toxic waste into the oceans. That is how I make up my carbon footprint, I don\'t directly dump toxic waste into the ocean.', ""I agree that much of the left does the same thing, and I tune out of the sources that do. Everything seems to be either outrage news, or unwilling to listen to anyone who goes against establishment narratives. There isn't a single news source, left, right or centre that I actually trust at the moment.  The left is more likely to think that rightwingers are unethical in their beliefs. But the right is more likely to say the left is actually evil. Think Tucker Carlson at Americafest saying the left is possessed with a spirit of destruction. The Christian right is particularly prone to this idea that the left actually want to make things worse.  The left often believe that the right are willing to make things worse for some people for the benefit of others (e.g. make things worse for women for the benefit of men, make things worse for immigrants for the benefit of native born people). But I can't recall seeing anyone say that the right actually wants to make things worse for everyone, or for everyone except an elite, as the conspiracist right often say. The right are the only ones that go to that level in any numbers.  I think that viewing people that disagree with you as genuinely evil is far more destructive than viewing them as racists, because it means they can't be reasoned with or negotiated with, and their arguments can't be taken seriously. It's completely toxic to politics. Thinking they disagree with you because they're racist usually doesn't have that effect. When it does, it is toxic too (I mean, unless you're talking about someone like David Duke who genuinely is racist to the point of not being worth engaging with).  But I think it is very important that the left prioritises natural explanations for why people disagree with them (they're racist, they're deluded, they're homophobic) rather than writing them off entirely. To be clear, most of the right uses natural explanations too (they're lazy, they hate white people, they're inexperienced). But I don't actually think this is a problem if it doesn't make discourse break down, and I think there is often some truth in in. (though I think there is much more truth in what the left says about the right than what the right says about the left)  I've never seen anyone say that rightwingers actually want to kill old people, though. That would be crossing the line away from reasonable explanations."", 'I’m mean literally if they don’t release these documents to the public or bring up charges before the changing of the guard none of it will matter. If the committee does not act soon then the right will brush the biggest crime against democracy under the rug and it won’t be truly addressed until 3/4 of the people who helped in the attempted overthrowing of democracy are dead and cold in the ground.    Charges may never stick, but put out every single shred of evidence into the public, every name, every date, every dollar that trump had dealt with, was a part of or touched. It’s time to go scorched earth, if we really can’t lock him up then let’s make sure we ruin the lives of anyone who helped that traitor, let’s tarnish his name so that only authoritarian regimes will be willing to work with him, on top of that let’s show what regimes have already worked with him. Let’s show his feral fanbase how he has grifted his way through life by duping people like them so that if anyone supports him after it then it is because they are beyond stupid, stupidly loyal, or are as corrupt as him, let his name go from being gold painted to shit stained.   There must be consequences for his actions of some kind, almost 100 million cases of covid and over a million dead Americans, caused by his gross negligence of the pandemic by ignoring doctors, pushing pseudoscience, selling strategic medical reserves and cutting back protocols for a quick buck. He has taken billions from authoritarian regimes such as the saudis renting out dozens of rooms in his buildings with a 99 year lease, he has disgraced the troops, he has divided our nation, he instigated an insurrection, to name a very few of his horrible actions from a very long list.He must pay, if the republicans will still play dirty and make sure he won’t see criminal charges, then it’s time to play dirty too and pull the blinds back on everything he does so that there can be no doubt about how much of a worthless being he and his family is, that one daughter of his is lucky, she tried to get out when she could, it’s sad that I’m sure she will still get caught up in the shit cacophony that is the trump family.

Better to say that I am flexible on exactly two things (as I have acknowledged, repeatedly): a) What constitutes consent to use of the body. b) When and if that consent is binding.  I started off with a maximalist position on b) in that this isn\'t a mortgage and consent can be withdrawn for any time and any reason, but was *persuaded* to reconsider.  Though, if we\'re going to complain about shifting positions, you said you only objected to the issue in case of consensual sex and then immediately started going after rape as well, so I\'m very tempted to write that concession off as bad faith and say that if they ever invent reversible organ donations, *never piss off your kidney donor for the rest of your natural life*.   Wow, really cool of you to clip out the part where I do, not, in fact, take that back.   Well of course the fetus needs be alive, otherwise it\'s a fucking miscarriage now isn\'t it? Surely if the fetus *wasn\'t* alive you wouldn\'t argue that she should still carry it, would you? Like, I sincerely don\'t get why you keep saying ""so you\'re saying x needs to be *alive*"" like it\'s some kind of dunk -- if all of the participants in this drama *weren\'t* alive there\'d be nothing at all to discuss.   And if I forcibly evicted you and made you move to a big city against your will, or put a gun to your head and made you drive me somewhere, you would say I\'m being monstrously evil, *right*?   It seems like arguments of more than a few words at a time are hard for you to follow, yes. I\'ll try again. Bodily autonomy takes precedence over life. Bodily autonomy takes precedence over life even if it kills the other person. If you can restore bodily autonomy without killing the person, that\'s nice. But only if you can, in fact, restore bodily autonomy.    I\'m old enough to watch the ""mainstream leftwing argument"" fail miserably, because it *doesn\'t* make sense.  If you define ""life"" as ""consciousness"", then some irritating pedant is going to ask if it\'s okay for me to kill you in your sleep. If you say, no, that\'s insane, then they ask how long Grandma *does* have to be in a coma before she\'s legally a corpse and we inherit her fortune. Either way, you\'ll either find yourself being ""inconsistent"" on the definition of life or you\'ll give up and ban abortion.  Now, if you\'re going to define life as ""viability"" and ""viability"" as ""ability to live independently of another human"", then... I guess we\'ve been violently agreeing with each other, except that you seem to want to say the unviable fetus is not ""alive"" and I think it is but that that\'s irrelevant.   So, based on what you responded to, ""You can\'t ignore the argument about life"" means I *can* ignore the argument about life until I have completely exhausted the argument about bodily autonomy, and only consider life if I\'m satisfied that it will have absolutely no bearing on that autonomy.  You\'re right, that *was* hard to parse, almost as if you were desperately trying to twist your statement into meaning something completely opposite so you could say ""you were wrong"" and declare victory. Okay, champ. You win. I sure can\'t ignore life. Sweet dreams.', ' It was brought up because those are much better at preventing unwanted pregnancies, if you are truly in favor of those it\'s odd of you to ignore those points since widespread sex education and easy access to contraceptives drastically reduce abortions, especially compared to your idea of just telling people not to have sex. The points still stand in general though, since conservatives are largely against sex education and easy access to contraceptives.   The overwhelming majority of anti-abortion people are religious, the entire movement is founded by modern religious groups. Once they die out, so will their ""cause"".   It\'s not alive, it\'s not the same as killing a baby that\'s alive. It seems like you\'re aiming for a ""gotcha"" here by pointing out that you can be charged with murder for causing the unwanted termination of a fetus, but that does not conflict with abortion. Abortion is the choice of the woman carrying the baby, kicking a pregnant woman is not the woman\'s choice, and that\'s why there is a law against it. That same law even has a provision explicitly stating that it does not apply when a woman consents to have an abortion.', ' All women are marginalized in a forced birth society, and women who would have been alive aside from abortion bans are killed BY YOU.  Just because sometimes people die naturally does not make killing women okay. Would you accept it if I told you that abortion is perfectly fine because sometimes fetuses die?   FORCED pregnancy is not okay.   FORCED pregnancy is not okay. FORCED pregnancy is rape. You seek to rape and kill women through FORCED pregnancy.   Some people may have a heart attack naturally but it\'s not okay to deliberately give someone a heart attack.  Some people may die naturally but it\'s not okay to kill them.  Some women die in childbirth but it\'s not okay to kill women in childbirth.   Sure: [https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/oct/severe-maternal-morbidity-united-states-primer](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/severematernalmorbidity.html)  *""While maternal deaths in the United States number about 650 to 750 annually, severe maternal morbidity affects approximately 50,000 to 60,000 women each year, and the numbers are increasing.""*   So you think it\'s okay to visit any level of violence on a woman as long as it doesn\'t kill us. Do you beat your wife to a pulp every night? Do you go around raping every woman you see? Why not? it\'s not killing us. Praise modern medicine! Amirite?   ANd when you FORCE a woman to stay pregnant and give birth, she is neither choosing to stay pregnant or accepting that risk. If she dies, YOU KILLED HER.   And you\'re perfectly fine with killing us in forced childbirth. You are pro-killing-women. Just say it. Just say that you want us dead.   It is if you\'re KILLING SOMEONE THROUGH FORCED BIRTH. If they could have gotten an abortion and didn\'t because of PL laws, PLERS KILLED HER. YOU KILLED HER.  Admit you\'re in favor of women dying to ""save babies."" Just say it. Say you\'re not in favor of protecting ALL life because you want women dead.   Allowing abortions allows women to get abortions and avoid childbirth. Abortion is far far safer than childbirth, and allowing every woman who wants an abortion to get one ensures that nobody is FORCED to risk death.   You don\'t, because they don\'t work. Women still die and you are fine with it. You say ""some women die, and it\'s tragic,"" and shrug and walk away. You rationalize it by saying it\'s perfectly fine to visit any level of violence on a woman you want--you may rape us, beat us, maim us, brutalize us--as long as you don\'t *kill* us. PRAISE MODERN MEDICINE. Amirite?   YOU ARE MURDEROUS. You want to hurt women, you want to commit violence against women, and you want to kill women. Just admit it. Just say that ""life exceptions"" means putting women in the ground, and you are fine with that. Just say that you are happy to visit ANY level of violence against a woman as long as it doesn\'t kill us, but also you\'re perfectly fine with killing us.  ""Women just die,"" you say. ""Our deaths are tragic but THINK OF THE BABIES,"" you say. ""I\'m fine with you dying,"" you say. Just admit it. Just own it. You\'re just as much of a murderer as you think I am.   More so, since killing women is killing actual PEOPLE, whereas killing a fetus is just killing a clot of tissue.']"

HIV- A Virus Like No Other. http://theperthgroup.com/HIV/TPGVirusLikeNoOther.pdf  IS HIV THE CAUSE OF AIDS? An interview with Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos By Christine Johnson Continuum Autumn 1997 http://virusmyth.com/aids/hiv/cjinterviewep.htm  **Robert Gallo is a fraud** https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html  Dr. Peter Duesberg states:  “For them to justify their existence and their expenses, and make their careers they have to find infectious diseases.”  “The more diseases that they could lump into this AIDS syndrome, ‘S’ stands for Syndrome, the better the chances are they get patients under that umbrella. The more patients they could catch.”  **PCR inventor Kary Mullis writes:**   “In 1988 I was working as a consultant at Specialty Labs in Santa Monica, CA, setting up analytic routines for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). **I knew a lot about setting up analytic routines for anything with nucleic acids in it because I invented the Polymerase Chain Reaction. That\'s why they hired me.**     Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), on the other hand, was something I did not know a lot about. Thus, when **I found myself writing a report on our progress and goals for the project, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, I recognized that I did not know the scientific reference to support a statement I had just written: ""HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.""**     **So I turned to the virologist at the next desk, a reliable and competent fellow, and asked him for the reference. He said I didn\'t need one.** I disagreed. While it\'s true that certain scientific discoveries or techniques are so well established that their sources are no longer referenced in the contemporary literature, that didn\'t seem to be the case with the HIV/AIDS connection. **It was totally remarkable to me that the individual who had discovered the cause of a deadly and as-yet-uncured disease would not be continually referenced in the scientific papers until that disease was cured and forgotten.** But as I would soon learn, the name of that individual - who would surely be Nobel material - was on the tip of no one\'s tongue.”   “After ten or fifteen meetings over a couple years, I was getting pretty upset when no one could cite the reference. I didn\'t like the ugly conclusion that was forming in my mind: The entire campaign against a disease increasingly regarded as a twentieth century Black Plague was based on a hypothesis whose origins no one could recall. That defied both scientific and common sense.     **Finally, I had an opportunity to question one of the giants in HIV and AIDS research, DL Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute,** when he gave a talk in San Diego. It would be the last time I would be able to ask my little question without showing anger, and I figured Montagnier would know the answer. So I asked him.     **With a look of condescending puzzlement, Montagnier said, ""Why don\'t you quote the report from the Centers for Disease Control? ""**     **I replied, ""It doesn\'t really address the issue of whether or not HIV is the probable cause of AIDS, does it?""**     **”No,"" he admitted, no doubt wondering when I would just go away.** He looked for support to the little circle of people around him, but they were all awaiting a more definitive response, like I was.     **”Why don\'t you quote the work on SIV [Simian Immunodeficiency Virus]?"" the good doctor offered.**     **”I read that too, DL Montagnier,"" I responded. ""What happened to those monkeys didn\'t remind me of AIDS. Besides, that paper was just published only a couple of months ago. I\'m looking for the original paper where somebody showed that HIV caused AIDS.**     This time, DL **Montagnier\'s response was to walk quickly away to greet an acquaintance across the room.”**     “We have not been able to discover any good reasons why most of the people on earth believe that AIDS is a disease caused by a virus called HIV. There is simply no scientific evidence demonstrating that this is true.     We have also not been able to discover why doctors prescribe a toxic drug called AZT (Zidovudine) to people who have no other complaint other than the fact that they have the presence of antibodies to HIV in their blood. In fact, we cannot understand why humans would take this drug for any reason.”  http://www.duesberg.com/viewpoints/kintro.html', 'That you could get covid even if you were vaccinated.', ' Except they didn\'t, this is a (probably deliberately) inaccurate retelling of what they said based on what was at the time obvious right wing fear mongering. Vaccines aren\'t magic, they aren\'t a 100% effective super-shield, and no one actually made those claims. What *was* claimed is that they significantly reduced your chance of catching the virus, their effectiveness scales with adoption rate, and if you *did* get sick while vaccinated, your symptoms would likely be much more manageable, less deadly, and much less likely to result in hospitalization. When some conservative then gets sick and cries, ""they said I\'d be immune!"" it does not mean that ""they"" ever actually claimed you\'d be immune.  There\'s also the conflation about variants. The initial vaccine was very good at preventing you from catching the original variant of COVID, but not at preventing you from catching later variants, though it still helps with symptoms. Ignoring this as information regarding new variants continues to come out is at best willfully ignorant, and more likely just dishonest.   According to the data, that is very improbable. Not impossible, but unlikely, and at best anecdotal. Reported instances of heart conditions (misophonia) are incredibly low relative to the number of vaccines administered. When I looked up the actual numbers when someone was trying to argue this ""vaccines are dangerous"" point to me, the numbers _they gave me_ from the CDC website came out to about a 0.00004% chance of heart related issues following a vaccine dose. And that\'s not deaths, that\'s just literally any instance of misophonia, fatal or not.   1: it\'s not healthy skepticism; you\'re repeating long debunked claims, obvious misinformation, and have a clear misunderstanding of many relevant facts (like the basic fact that vaccine effectiveness differs between variants).  2: no one called you a fascist, you\'re just playing victim, lol.   No one has an issue with non-partisan research into any duration of side effects. That\'s literally just research. Calling it a ""legal investigation"" is very sus though, because that already implies it is not non-partisan at all, and implies it has little to do with any actual science. Calling it a ""legal"" investigation into mRNA technology as well is pretty sus - conservatives like to pretend that mRNA tech is something scientists just made up and shoved out in 2020 just for COVID, but the mRNA distribution of vaccines has been under development and being researched since the 90\'s. This is not actually a new technology like you\'ve been misled to believe.']"

The bulk of the revenue would come from the change in how we tax businesses. Below is an excerpt from my site.       Additional studies will need to be done to figure out the optimal new tax rate. However, we can use the Medicare amount that was collected in 2020 of $899.9B, that was collected via a 1.45% tax rate done on all wages (instead of using Social Security numbers that have an earnings cap) to estimate with a corporate tax rate of 15% we could see over $9T collected, which is more than double the $3.42T in total government revenue that was collected in 2020.

The problem in a lot of america is the specificity.  I came from a medical city in the US.  Most of the people there are doctors or nurses or various other kinds of medical workers.  Millionaires are not uncommon.  And these aren't stock market winners or anything, they're just people that grew up, went to school, and got jobs in an industry that pays them.    There are still industries like that, however most of them don't really allow for or even really desire mass employment.  A big hospital might employ anywhere from several hundred to a few thousand doctors and 4 or 5 times that in nurses, but it's a big hospital, and in a city of a few hundred thousand that's not enough.    It's the problem with so many of the 'modern' industries that talking heads will say are the way of the future and will still give you a good life.  It's not exactly untrue.  Science, Engineering, Medical, etc.  These kinds of jobs do often pay well.   What they're ignoring though is that none of them are actually replacements for industry in terms of just the sheer numbers of people employed, so the very act of shifting from an economy built on well-paid manufacturing to high tech jobs shrinks your middle class massively.    To make it worse all of these jobs require extensive education that costs so much that if you don't find a good job to pay them back you'll cripple yourself financially, and that the more people that try to get into these fields in order to get one of the last true middle class jobs the more competitive they become and the less likely you are to get that job, leaving you with your massive student loans and no job to pay them, made worse as the years pass and your resume is now marked as 'over-educated' so companies won't hire you becuase they think you'll want to be well-paid due to your education but don't consider you worth it because you lack experience.

In addition, the physical demands of railroad work can take a toll on workers\' bodies over time, and many rail workers may experience long-term health problems as a result of their work. It is important for employers to provide a safe and healthy work environment, and to provide workers with the necessary training and protective equipment to prevent accidents and injuries.  Overall, fair compensation for any worker should not just be based on the salary or wages earned, but should also consider the risks and hazards that come with the job.

I am arguing this...but, how do I put this (you made me introspective on my position), I learned how to debate in school a long time ago, and we were taught to separate ourselves from the argument. So this is not to say I am all about Elon in the slightest. I merely see his position, and what he is trying to achieve. I agree that he should never have bought Twitter in the first place, and they crucified him to the valuation he offered. What perplexes me is that he never pressed on the bot issue (??).   Seems odd he would use that as an excuse to not pay the amount, then get tripped up in his own hubris over an offer, that they ""made him buy Twitter."" Which doesn\'t say much for the company; the execs wanted to get out of the company so desperately, they twisted his arm to follow through on his offer.  Look, I saw what he did with doge (a MAJOR pump and dump scheme). I thought he was going to ruin all of crypto with that scheme, even though doge was a complete meme-coin, that it would be used to ruin the integrity (potentiality) of say, Bitcoin itself. To be fair, on the Friday before his SNL show he did mention not to ""put your life\'s savings"" into the coin, and then, right in the middle of his opening monologue, it dumped. Lost $20 on that, lol.   However, the revelations made by Matt Taibbi, and the other reporters involved in these disclosures (trading upon their ethos), has shown there are/we\'re some irregularities in the way Twitter went about it\'s business. We may have known it censored or shadow banned, but he CONFIRMED this. And to me, that is a big deal, especially when Twitter execs claimed otherwise in Congressional testimony. He made it fact, and provided evidence of this, and now this is in the public forum for us to discuss. Did he overplay his hand with the ""real time doxxing?"" Heck yes, and that may be his downfall. He was doing so well, playing with his new toy, and now he fell from grace so fast, and it may all have gone to waste.

I was explaining the reason, not asserting whether it’s right or wrong. I already said that I shouldn’t have used the words “should be punished” but rather “are punished”. That’s what I had meant and I made it clear that I misspoke.   Nope. I’ve addressed it many times but I’ll address it again. It’s unethical because people shouldn’t be allowed to have dangerous killing machines that have caused mass murders and that they don’t need.   Nope again. I already explained how I misspoke and clarified myself in the first example (that’s not making anything up). Also, saying that unethical laws should be changed is not a new standard. It’s an existing standard. Look at laws through history up to now that have been reformed. Ask anyone with common sense.   Then go to a shooting range for target practice. No need to own guns in your home   Ask all the families of all the victims of the school shootings and gun massacres that have occurred in America. I can give you so many more examples of mass murders caused by guns than you can give me of “mass murders” caused by alcohol. Do people use guns or alcohol in war to cause damage? America is a laughing stock for other countries because of the amount of shootings that happen here, and the fact that people like you ignore the glaring evidence that guns are more harmful than they protect. The studies literally show that people like you have a “knowledge deficit” in the statistics regarding guns, which is why you live in denial. You can’t cause mass murder with alcohol, you can cause it with guns. And since you keep mentioning the Carrollton bus collision, I already said that we have laws against drunk driving to prevent that. No matter what laws you make, some people will violate those laws. But making the laws cuts down on the frequency of people doing harmful things.    1) No ones forcing you to go near a pitbull 2) There’s plenty of options to eat meat, so you don’t need elk, 3) go to a shooting range and borrow a gun. There are alternatives for all the uses of guns. So you don’t need one unless you want to hurt others.   Give me the statistics on how many grandmas absolutely needed a gun to protect themselves when they had things like knives, hammers, police, etc available   They did already existed. I only added them because you didn’t have the common sense to understand them already. Like the fact that guns are not sentient like people. Just cause I add something doesn’t mean that it didn’t already exist. If someone walks into a room, does that mean they didn’t exist before entering the room?   Lmaoooooooo, are you that desperate that you’re literally making something up that i never said 😂? And you’re the one accusing me of making stuff up.     Yes it did, and that’s why a lot of laws have been reformed lmao. Like laws to ban slavery and promote equal rights. So unless you want to deny history and what the majority of people will say, I’m not making anything up   I already explained multiple times how I misspoke in the first quote and if you’re so desperate to win that you keep ignoring that, that’s on you buddy.   Putting words in my mouth again I see. Give me the proof where I said that. I’m advocating for getting rid of guns, not people who own them, which can be enforced without hurting people.   Let me just jog my memory on how guns protect people. Oh wait that’s right. By hurting other people    Some explosives are illegal.    Like I said above, give me the statistics on how often that’s necessary   Yep and guns also increase homicides and mass murders, not just suicide. They are inherently dangerous. If alcohol was as dangerous as guns, then why can’t people use alcohol instead of guns in wars?   Is everclear the only type of alcohol that people consume?   I never said guns shouldn’t be used in war, I’ve been referring to domestic ownership. Also, since you own a gun, why don’t you go liberate Ukraine?', ' Nope, I’ve said countless times that if a law is unethical, it should be changed, because enforcing that law would also be unethical. Look at my previous comments if you don’t believe me.   Yep, I was comparing to the holocaust. If you think something like the holocaust happened in america for people violating gun laws, you are deluded.   There’s a lot of things I need to survive on a daily basis. So what you’re saying is objectively false.    Yep, I did. I said that wanting to kill people for fun with guns is sadistic and immoral. Not the same with alcohol. Seems like you lack the ability to pay attention.   Guns are killing machines, alcohol isn’t.   Guns are only used to hurt people. If you want to do target practice, you can use paintball guns. There’s no other need for actual guns.   It’s illegal to own a bomb because of the danger they pose to society. There.   Didn’t talk about the earth, I was talking about me. You lack reading comprehension skills it seems.   Nope, my standard was prohibiting things that are BOTH designed to be lethal/cause mass murders and not needed.   I’m not changing any standards. Protecting humans as sentient beings has been the standard in any ethical/legislative discussions. I just had to bring it up because it was clear that you lacked the critical thinking skills to realize the guns can’t be compared to humans or body parts.   Were you born with a gun attached to your body? That’s right, you weren’t.    Making guns illegal will drastically lower people’s ability to obtain and own guns. Will some people break the law? Sure. But then they’ll be punished. And again, eyeballs aren’t dangerous and they are a part of people’s bodies which they own. Guns aren’t    Not necessarily. Guns laws can be enforced by closing down stores that sell guns, imprisoning/fining people who guns, etc. No shooting involved in those scenarios. SWAT raids are only one option that are used when necessary    Again, I have mentioned it many times, but it’s not my fault if you don’t have reading comprehension skills. It’s not my responsibility to be punished for someone’s else’s actions.   I’ve said multiple times that alcohol isn’t killing anyone unless it’s abused. Guns are inherently killing machines. They are *only* used to hurt.   Again, I’ve said multiple times that alcohol in moderation has minimal health risks. Most people who drink alcohol will be fine. Anyone who uses a gun on people will hurt those people.    Then why do you need them? I already said you could go to a shooting range or use paintball guns for target practice. No need to own them.   Alcohol is not a killing machine and it’s not used to hurt others so it’s fine to trust people with it at home. Same doesn’t apply to guns   Guns are the machines through which people inflict mass murders. It seems like you lack basic common sense as well.   People   We also have laws to forbid people from driving drunk. Some people unfortunately break those laws, the same way that some people break any laws   Think again. I’ve never said anything of those things. I said countless times that laws could be unethical and if so, they should be changed. But gun laws aren’t. You haven’t given me one good reason why guns laws would be unethical that I wasn’t able to refute. I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve said that.    I just gave you two examples in this message. Owning explosives and driving drunk. Both are illegal because both are unsafe. Also, I don’t magically make up new standards. I bring up relevant ones that you ignore that cannot be applied to guns. Like for example, guns are not sentient beings like humans. So you can’t apply guns laws to humans.', ' I clarified what I meant there a long time ago because I clearly misspoke. I had said that in response to you saying that people violating gun laws are thrown into jail to reduce suicides. I responded by saying that they are thrown into jail because they violated a law. Go back to that comment if you don’t believe me. My mistake was using the word “should” instead of the word “are”. But I clarified my meaning. I also clarified that punishment for violating laws occurs because that’s how laws fundamentally work. If they didn’t, no one would follow any laws. After that, I also made it clear that if a law itself is unethical, it should be reformed because enforcing it would be unethical. Just because something is legal doesn’t mean it’s ethical. I didn’t make up any new standards. This is quite literally common sense and anyone with common sense would agree with me.    No, I brought up fundamental differences between guns and alcohol that makes your analogy invalid. In case you don’t know how analogies work, the comparison has to be valid 1) Alcohol is something that people consume for fun, and if used in moderation, it has minimal health risks. It isn’t normally used to hurt people and it doesn’t cause mass murder. The examples you brought up about the driving accidents are examples where alcohol is illegal: you can’t drive while drunk. 2) Guns are dangerous killing machines that have the ability to cause mass murders. I can give you a long list of examples of schools shootings and people using guns to mass murder people. They have no use unless you want to hurt people. If you want to do target practice, you can use paintball guns, other fake guns, or just go to a shooting range where you can use a gun for target practice. If you want to protect yourself, you can use knives, hammers, or any other household object.     I didn’t create any standards. Multiple standards already exist and I brought those into the discussion to refute the absurd claims you were making. For example, you said people should be killed because they aren’t needed like guns. And I said that people are sentient beings, not guns. This is an objective fact, not just some random standard I made up. Another example: where I said that if a law is unethical, it should be changed. Again, I didn’t make up a new standard. Ask anyone and they will agree with me. I again just brought it into the conversation to refute your claims. I didn’t just make it up.   It’s funny you are the one saying that, the person that compared getting rid of guns to getting rid of people (who are sentient living beings, not objects like guns) and the same person who compared enforcing gun laws to the holocaust (which is one of the biggest atrocities committed in history). I never once said that no person has been protected by a gun. I said that there are literal studies that prove that guns harm more than they protect. Saying ownership of explosives is illegal is not psychotic, it’s the law and for good reason. They are extremely dangerous. I also gave you many options that fulfill the same purpose as guns, so there’s no need to have guns.    Nope. Drunk driving is one scenario where alcohol is harmful and that’s why we have laws against it. Alcohol otherwise used in moderation has minimal health risks. Guns are inherently dangerous and lethal. I’ve given you alternatives for all the uses of guns, so there’s no need to own something so dangerous. What’s the alternative to drinking alcohol that would produce the same effect that causes people to enjoy alcohol?']

On Feb. 23, hours before the invasion began, Sandworm took another swing, launching malware that infected several hundred Ukrainian government computers, officials said. The intrusion was detected quickly, the damage contained.  Then Sandworm struck again. But the code it used looked like it had been thrown together at the last minute, with programming errors — another fail.  Sandworm wasn’t done. In its boldest stroke yet, it went after the Ukrainian military’s satellite communications, used by soldiers in the field. It worked, and by 6:15 a.m. on Feb. 24, the system went down, right at Ukraine’s most vulnerable moment.  It could have been a crippling blow. But the Ukrainian government had a backup plan: a separate satellite communications system, which it had tested only two months before, to make sure it was ready in the event of a Russian invasion.    ...  Ukrainian law enforcement officials started noticing something else suspicious as well: a spike in foreign cellphone numbers near the border, in the forests between Ukraine and Belarus.  Russian soldiers were using cellphones to call home, and suddenly popping up on Ukrainian networks. Officials who monitor the traffic during peacetime for criminal activity quickly realized they could see and hear the invaders approaching in real time.  “We listened to the Russian soldiers as they panicked and called their friends and relatives,” said an official who oversees the phone intercepts. “They used ordinary phones to make decisions about their further moves.”  Down long corridors guarded by locks with facial detection, behind doors sealed with wax to detect intruders, teams of women tracked the Russian troops from small listening booths while their friends and relatives grabbed rifles to patrol the streets.  “We understood where the enemy was, what numbers they were using,” the official said.  The eavesdroppers passed the details to Ukraine’s armed forces to carry out ambushes and counterattacks. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, said Ukrainian forces used cellphone signals and even TikTok videos to target a unit of Chechen soldiers known as the Kadyrovtsy, named for the strongman leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.  It took 40 minutes from the time one video was uploaded to pinpoint the unit’s location near the Hostomel airport northwest of Kyiv, Mr. Budanov said. The Ukrainian military then hit them with three Tochka-U ballistic missiles, he said.  The Russians kept closing in on Kyiv, forcing the eavesdroppers tucked in listening rooms to make a quick decision: destroy their equipment and flee for their own safety, or hang on and continue gathering intelligence.  They stayed.  “We didn’t lose Ukraine. We didn’t let the enemy move further,” the official said. “On the first days, when they made foolish mistakes, we used their foolish mistakes to our advantage.”"", 'If El Paso had been embroiled in a separatist movement for 8 years yeah I really wouldn\'t have a problem with it, especially if not allowing El Paso to be independent meant the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives, massive damage to US infrastructure, and a decades spanning crippled economy. The Donbas and Eastern Ukraine has always been a contested area, even in the original elections those areas went to Ukraine by margins so narrow that in the US we would have held special elections for in many areas. Let\'s not pretend that these areas were the same as the rest of Ukraine, that Putin ever voiced interest in any area outside of these hotly contested areas, or that the people in these areas don\'t blame Ukraine for the war and not the Russians. You don\'t even have to read Russian sources, the financial times conducted interviews in Bakhmut and even the Ukrainian military in the area said that was a common sentiment in the area.   Let\'s also not forget that Zelensky ran on a platform of making peace with the Russians and ran on that platform but proceeded to do the opposite due to pressure from the West.   For the record I don\'t believe NATO troops are in Ukraine or that Ukraine is full of Nazis, I do believe that these areas of Ukraine have wanted independence for a long time, have fought for this independence for a long time, and that Ukraine doesn\'t really care all that much about these areas since they conducted shelling operations in these areas the day before the Russian invasion in violation of the Minsk accords. About dictators today that we support, Egypt? Saudi Arabia? Alegeria? Afghanistan (hardly a democracy, run by a warlord before that fell apart)? There are quite a few oppressive regimes and dictatorships we fund.  As for the Belt and Road initiative, how exactly is increasing a military budget going to help solve that? Are we going to start bombing countries for having Chinese funded infrastructure projects? It\'s not as though the Chinese government is sending its military to these places, they are using money and deals to gain and exercise power, and that\'s not something we can stop with guns and missiles. We can\'t just send soldiers to a country\'s port and say ""we own this now"", we\'d look like thugs because that\'s exactly what we would be.   Yes Russia is making friends in Iran and Syria. What the hell else do you expect them to do? We have cut them off from the rest of the world. We create enemies with our attempts at ""spreading democracy"" which is just code for ""we just want people in charge who we are friends with"" then cry and panic when it fails and other countries who we don\'t like make friends with the countries we made enemies out of. There is a reason why the Iranians don\'t like us and that\'s because we did a regime change in the 40\'s, the Syrians don\'t like us for the same reason.   Yes, as a NYC resident and native I\'m well aware of 9/11, but had our government exercised any competency it never would have happened, it was a preventable tragedy. All the whole war on terror, aka America\'s pissing contest with Islamofascists, did was make more people side with the Islamofascists because when your family is killed in a drone attack you lose all sympathy you may have had for some Americans that died in the WTC. Also, who was supporting the Taliban, Al-Queda, ISIS, and all these other groups before they attacked the US???? The US. WE CREATE OUR OWN PROBLEMS. The interventionism inevitably fails because we back losing causes, we increase resentment towards us, and our takeaway is that next time we should intervene harder. We are chasing the illusion that every country we dislike is like Nazi Germany and that if we win we can create a functional liberal democracy like we did there.   I think you overestimate Ukraine and misunderstand the Russian strategy, blitzing quickly may have been the original strategy but ever since April the new strategy has been the war of attrition, camp the positions, abandon areas that aren\'t defendable, and wait out Ukraine and it\'s working. Ukraine is running out of weapons, the new ones they are getting although more advanced cannot be maintained in the Ukraine and have to be sent to Germany for repairs (as the people who know how to fix them cannot be in Ukraine as the Russians would treat it as an act of war) and this will only further stress the already overworked supply lines into Ukraine. 100 billion dollars spent and can we really say that they caused 100 billion in damages to the Russian military or prevented 100 Billion dollars in damages to their own country? Most of Ukraine\'s energy grid is in the crapper, most are on the brink of starving or freezing this winter, is this what victory looks like? Was all this worth it?   I also think you overestimate effect of sanctions on Russia and underestimate the undeniably worse effect they have had on the West. Europe is going through an energy crisis, fertilizer increased in cost substantially, there are food shortages across the world. We have also permanently ensured that Russia will never rejoin the global financial system no matter who is in power because of the animosity we created by ceasing the assets of Russian civilians abroad. Now Russia and china are creating their own financial system which they will use with their new friends in the middle east to trade oil, which is a massive blow to the dollar.   I love America, I love the country, I love it\'s people, I love the constitution. What I don\'t love is our insane approach to foreign policy and our indifference towards the horrors of the wars we cause and escalate.

Did I say that was a bad thing?   What I said was there\'s no such thing as ""affordable housing"". This is a market. Affordability is relative. I can afford to live in New York. It\'s not affordable to the average person which is why the average person should not be in New York. It\'s not that complicated.   I also said development doesn\'t make prices come down because, well, it doesn\'t. Development adds value, it doesn\'t dilute it.

Why are we always in here talking about building housing units in already dense cities instead of encouraging development in places that lack density?', 'I’m going to go off a bit here because I think your take is one that shows you havent done real research into the issue or actually talked with renters/buyers/landlords recently.  San Francisco is a drop in the bucket compared to the national amount of units up for rent.  You’re acting like those types of regulations are everywhere, when for the vast majority of Americans they are not. It’s also highly debatable that those are causing the problems in SF and relative markets, since these are cities that cannot expand anymore and have a generally fixed footprint.  Rent is high everywhere, even in the rural south, because the homes are all being bought up by rental investors and the new generation of home buyer is struggling to get housed and are being stuck in high rent situations that hinder their ability to save the capital necessary to purchase for themselves (with very high prices compounding the issue).   It’s not a nationwide issue because of some regulations on large cities that ensure granny can afford her rent because the landlord that has owned the building for 40 years wants to make more on top the mortgage or because some shitty rent management company wants to make a larger commission.  You’re also completely overlooking large cities incentivizing HUD homes that regulate rent but pay homeowners the difference, this would still incentivize more units to be built.  Take your head out of your ass, this is very simple supply and demand, not some abstract issue with market regulations in some areas affecting the national rental supply.']"

The opposing force is leftism, which is the philosophy that society will be happier and more prosperous when power is distributed as much as possible.  Democracy is leftist, which is why conservatism attacks democracy as much as possible, only limited in the US by the fact that democracy is a pillar of American values.

This happens through repetition and through the affirmation from your peers who are being subjected to the same narrative.  This is true for both sides.   If you cannot see the inherent bias in your media and the flaws in your leaders as well as the positives in the opposition then its safe to say you\'ve been compromised and your being influenced, if not outright manipulated. Again this is true for most people regardless of their political leanings.   The reason why this is so Cleary the case with Musk is because most people give the see vague reasons why they dislike him.  Truth is he\'s bizzare because he\'s a very unique individual,  a one off,.he\'s highly intelligent in certain areas but lacks social intelligence.  This is actually extremely common for people like him.  People  talk crap about him being some elitist billionaire or being a narcissist or megalomaniac. He\'s none of those things.... well he is definitely a billionaire but other than his jet which honestly is a necessity when you are a CEO of a larğge and rapidly expanding international company.  But other than that he\'s not ai typical of some elitist D-bag billionaire.   Musk has enough money for neither him or his family to ever need to work again. I seriously mean never. Not his kids ,grandkids, great grand  kids etc. Yet all he does is work . For a while he had a tiny home  that he\'d stay in at the space X launch pad but I\'ve heard many talk about him often sleeping on the factory floor so he can keep getting things done if it calls for it.  He\'s singlehandedly responsible for the wide adoption of Evs. Because the innovations they\'ve made have  lowers  costs significantly.  They make great products that people enjoy and that will last a long time. Not only that but each of their products has the potential to make its owner money. But they have to make great products because they have no marketing department. When\'s the last time you\'ve seen a Tesla add or dealership? They don\'t have them which is friggin insane, completely unheard of for any large corporate producer of any product. This is why a socially awkward Musk is always stirring things up and causing a buzz with his tweets.Henis Teslas marketing department. That fact alone saves the company 100s of millions as year.  There\'s also the fact that once you understand his vision and how all of the products all of his companies are meant to be integrated. His vision of the future is a good one too. While billionaires like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates claim to be about the environment ,in reality that aren\'t. Instead they are about control.  All their ideas involve more regulations, less freedom for us,and more control for them. You\'ve got Gates preaching deportation and trying to get everyone to leave rural areas cand consolidate into major cities. Conveniently this will make people easier to control. But while he preaches that he\'s busy buying up as much farmland as he cN get his hands on. Gates is now the largest owner of farms in the country. This is a very bad thing. I mean it\'s already bad enough that the vast majority of all products at the grocery store are owned by only a handful  of companies. Imagine if only a handful grow all the food. Talk about power.1😬 Swab is preaching the great reset saying ""you\'ll own nothing but be happy "" All of their visions for our future are ones where all of us have to be OK with having significantly less while they get more. Musk on the other hand has a vision where things in the future are more decentralized so they give power to each individual rather than for him and his billionaire buddies Ike Gates and Schwab want.  Musk doesn\'t care about money or power. His motivation is one of impact. He wants to change the world in a significantly meaningful way. Sure you could  say that alone is selfish because he could be motivated by wanting ro be remembered and leaving  a legacy, but who doesn\'t want that?  All I want to know is where we\'re you guys when Twitter and FB were deliberately censoring or silencing people in order to manipulate people into voting for the candidates they back. This means that liberals were obviously the ones who were indoctrinated. That doesn\'t make you mad? Musk just released a ton of files show the blatant corruption and collision between liberal politicians and social media.  Coincidentally it was after he did this that they began attacking Musk hardcore. And all of you are now doing their bidding.  It\'s crazy. Why are all of you so obsessed with Musk...wait until he gets things dialed and reveals the real reason why he bought Twitter.....it\'s friggin genius and will benefit all of us greatly.  Yet you guys run around parroting concerns and hating on someone you don\'t even know and whose actions do no harm to you whatsoever. Hate all you want, it\'s what unsuccessful people do.

Carbon dioxide is a gas that traps heat (which is a greenhouse gas), so the more of it there is in the atmosphere, the warmer it gets. We keep on adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, so we are continuing to cause warming. However, it isn’t as simple as adding carbon dioxide directly increases warming. The addition of carbon dioxide and subsequent warming causes instabilities in other parts of the earth system, for example the salt concentration of ocean water. The warming causes melting of ice caps, which lessen the saltiness of sea water and disrupt ocean currents. As I mentioned before, the disruption of the Gulf Stream by the melting of Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice cap could disrupt the flow of the Gulf Stream to Europe, thereby plunging Europe into freezing temperatures as it is in a high latitude and is only kept mild by the warm Gulf Stream current. This is just one example, and the gist of it is that the addition of co2 to the atmosphere will cause a chain reaction of climate effects that will be entirely unpredictable. The only thing we can predict is the increase in atmospheric co2 concentrations, which will inevitably destabilize the climate. And the natural climate cycles never happen this quickly. Sure, we have the odd volcanic eruption that results in cooling, or increased solar activity that results in a little bit of warming, but we have seen an unprecedented increase in warming over the last 100 years, which directly correlates to the addition of co2 to the atmosphere by humans. Natural cycles do not cause change on such short scales, the processes that change the temperature/climate of earth either release co2 into the atmosphere (weathering of rock), or affect earths orbit/position (milankovitch cycles) operate on 1,000s to 100,000s of years. Meanwhile, this change has been occurring over little more than a century and directly parallels human consumption of fossil fuels, and is rising exponentially instead of at a steady rate. By the way, I learned a lot of this in my environmental science class but also through research.']"

The dictatorship of the proletariat is a state wherein all of society is organized around the reproduction and interests of the proletariat as a class. The interests of the proletariat include, but are not limited to, abundance of production, develop of production beyond the commodity from, continuous improvement in quality of life, common defense from reactionary elements both internal and external, development of intellectual life, development of cultural life, development of political life, social connectedness, and many many other things. So long as society is organized to provide, protect, and sustain these things, based in a rich understanding of class dynamics, then society is a DotP. It is not required for each individual proletarian to be a dictator unto themselves.', 'Look, I get this post is a vague attempt (I don’t think deliberately) to divert attention from the problems of capitalism and say “hey, don’t forgot, socialism and communism are even more awful,” but the problem is what you experienced was not really true socialism or communism or any of those systems; what you experienced was, above all else, fascism. It’s the same in Brazil, China and anywhere else people try to say “socialism doesn’t work.”  That’s my big issue anytime those ideologies get brought up, is that they aren’t argued in good faith. If you want to criticize socialism or communism or any other model than capitalism, fine, be my guest, but please use proper examples of capitalism and whatever other model you are criticizing. I’m speaking generally here, not to you specifically.  However, I do agree with the core of your comment though, regarding the importance of WHO is in power, regardless of the system. It’s why, as imperfect as it was, I still admire the Greeks system.', 'TL;DR stay a western shit-lib   If you actually read the content of those conversations where I ask for sources you’d find that they often have a running theme of me calling out people who make outlandish claims about communist political and economic topics. Ironic considering your commentary.   I will not deny I have not read The Civil War in France (1870) yet but besides that there’s nothing else you have said that has been further from the truth so fuck off with your profiling.  You said Marx had a different view of the Dictatorship of the proletariat from what MLs claim it to be. You also gave a very poor characterization of what MLs believe the DOTP to be. I detest people who do this type of shit then give a fucking Wikipedia article as their reference. The more politically charged a topic is the more a knowledge database where supposedly EVERYONE can contribute to the development of it has so many holes in how a communist could just take it with a grain of salt. Quotes can be cherry picked so easily it’s just more irony of the situation considering your original call out was about taking Marx out of context.   Lenin has already said plenty about the counter arguments posed by Kautsky in the 2nd International regarding Marx’s commentary on the DOTP (which is where you’re getting this from whether you’re aware of it or not):  ”Let us point out, in passing, that when calling the non-Bolsheviks in Russia, i.e., the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, socialists, Kautsky was guided by their name, that is, by a word, and not by the actual place they occupy in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. What a wonderful understanding and application of Marxism!”  “The question of the dictatorship of the proletariat is a question of the relation of the proletarian state to the bourgeois state, of proletarian democracy to bourgeois democracy. One would think that this is as plain as a pikestaff. But Kautsky, like a schoolmaster who has become as dry as dust from quoting the same old textbooks on history, persistently turns his back on the twentieth century and his face to the eighteenth century, and for the hundredth time, in a number of paragraphs, in an incredibly tedious fashion chews the old cud over the relation of bourgeois democracy to absolutism and medievalism!”  “But this means he utterly fails to understand what is what! One cannot help smiling at Kautsky’s effort to make it appear that there are people who preach “contempt for democracy” (p. 11) and so forth. That is the sort of twaddle Kautsky uses to befog and confuse the issue, for he talks like the liberals, speaking of democracy in general, and not of *bourgeois democracy*[my italics]; he even avoids using this precise, class term, and, instead, tries to speak about “presocialist” democracy. This windbag devotes almost one-third of his pamphlet, twenty pages out of sixty-three, to this twaddle, which is so agreeable to the bourgeoisie, for it is tantamount to embellishing bourgeois democracy, and obscures the question of the proletarian revolution.”  This view” (which Kautsky dubs “contempt for democracy”) “rests upon a single word of Karl Marx’s”. This is what Kautsky literally says on page 20. And on page 60 the same thing is repeated even in the form that they (the Bolsheviks) “opportunely recalled the little word” (that is literally what he says—des Wörtchens!!) “about the dictatorship of the proletariat which Marx once used in 1875 in a letter”.  Here is Marx’s “little word"":   First of all, to call this classical reasoning of Marx’s, which sums up the whole of his revolutionary teaching, “a single word” and even “a little word,” is an insult to and complete renunciation of Marxism. It must not be forgotten that Kautsky knows Marx almost by heart, and, judging by all he has written, he has in his desk, or in his head, a number of pigeon-holes in which all that was ever written by Marx is most carefully filed so as to be ready at hand for quotation. Kautsky must know that both Marx and Engels, in their letters as well as in their published works, repeatedly spoke about the dictatorship of the proletariat, before and especially after the Paris Commune. Kautsky must know that the formula “dictatorship of the proletariat” is merely a more historically concrete and scientifically exact formulation of the proletariat’s task of “smashing” the bourgeois state machine, about which both Marx and Engels, in summing up the experience of the Revolution of 1848, and, still more so, of 1871, spoke for forty years, between 1852 and 1891.”   [All of this and plenty more can be found in the 1st chapter of Lenin’s *The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/common_liberal.htm)   I doubt you will read all of this much like you won’t read that book but I’m plenty read on the subject of the dictatorship of the proletariat. How about you sit down with your pseudo-intellectual garbage like the rest of the anarchists and put your head down and do the actual reading.']"

Appointed offices have lower interest rates- an empirical validation that appointing smart people and leaving them away from the whims of (dumb) voters produces better results.

Plus the troops in South Korea are separated from China by North Korea, a country China supported for years and which is the very reason those troops are there in the first place, and China knows that.  And the troops in Japan are separated from China by the Sea of Japan, and by the Koreas and Russia after that.  So claiming US troops are ""ringing China"" or that there are 80,000 US troops on China\'s border is incredibly dishonest.

I know Croatia provided a pathway for return for Croatian Serbs, but it is bound in red tape, and many don\'t want to return anyway. However, they did provide a pathway as the UN demanded.  Israeli Jews were not innocent of terrorist incidents in that time either, so these incidents don\'t justify ethnic cleansing. Nothing justifies ethnic cleansing.  I\'m not asking Israelis to leave the land. That would be wrong. That would be ethnic cleansing. I\'m saying that ethnic cleansing is ethnic cleansing. There is no good ethnic cleansing. A permanent ban on returning Palestinians was wrong.  The ""nothing more is owed"" part is wrong. The Palestinians were ethnically cleansed. Ethnic cleansing is not an acceptable action. They are owed more than what they lost, they are owed compensation to be made as whole as possible in the event that a deal will not allow them to return to their homes.   That phrase- ""From the River to the Sea""- is a phrase where I give some people a pass for mixing up and using if they have shown that they don\'t want to expel Jews. I honestly think that Hamas chose an amazing slogan- one that clearly endorses genocide when used by them, but also gets spread to other people who don\'t realize that it originates as an anti-semitic slogan. If you don\'t know the context, it doesn\'t sound objectionable. It is honestly a really good encapsulation of how rhetoric on this entire conflict is completely fucked.  Also, you know who voted for Netanyahu\'s coalition, ensuring that there would be no two-state solution? Israelis. Whose coalition is responsible for illegal settlements? For the crimes that I\'ve listed on my comments above? Israel\'s hands aren\'t innocent either.', 'Well, while Palestinians refused the UN partition plan and attacked the Jewish Yishuv with the assistance of Arab countries and volunteers, at the end of 1948 they still had much of the land intended for them… except Egypt and Jordan occupied it for 19 years. Those countries held most of what was to be Palestine, denying Palestinian sovereignty, so they and the rest of the invading Arab armies should compensate them. Further Arab country belligerence caused the West Bank to be taken, so more reason for that responsibility.  As for the illegal settlements, the Palestinians are invited to have them. There’s no reason that while Israel is required to have large Arab Israeli minority, Palestine gets to insist on being free of Jews. They can enjoy a minority of far Right Jews as Palestinian citizens.  BTW, since you raised ‘Apartheid’, I’m curious if you’re aware that while Israel had an Arab minority since 1948, Jews were ethnically cleansed from Arab conquered territory at the same time? Jerusalem was cleared of Jews for the first time since Roman times. No Jews were allowed to remain in the West Bank where they had lived for centuries. Jews were barred from even praying in Jerusalem, for the first time since Roman times. So if anyone has a track record of total ethnic cleansing and Apartheid, it’s the Palestinians and Arab countries.', ' They should. But Israel should also pay for the lost real estate caused by not allowing Palestinians the right to return following the Nakba.   I have no issue with this, Israel can decide how to make these people whole.   I am aware of this, yes. I really fail to see what ""they ethnically cleansed us first"" is suppose to prove here.    &gt;So if anyone has a track record of total ethnic cleansing and Apartheid, it’s the Palestinians and Arab countries.   So does Israel, even if it wasn\'t *total* ethnic cleansing. I don\'t really see why ""Arabs did ethnic cleansing first"" means that Israel didn\'t do it too.   To be clear, when you say:   Are you saying that Israel does NOT have a history of ethnic cleansing and apartheid? Because that is how I\'m reading this sentence.  Israel forbid a large number of Palestinians who fled during the Nakba from returning. This was ethnic cleansing. Even if a large number of them fled for reasons other than being forced out by Israelis (fleeing fighting, fearing massacres (even if unfounded), advice from Arab leaders), refusing to allow them to return is ethnic cleansing.  Look at the laws that Israel applies to Palestinians and Jews, but not others. Israel doesn\'t allow naturalization for Palestinians in the West Bank or Gaza who marry an Israeli national. This is not a problem for other ethnicities/nationalities. This is because Israel considers Palestinians a demographic threat. This is a major point toward Israel being an apartheid state.   A large number of South African anti-apartheid leaders have pointed to Israel\'s policies in Gaza and the West Bank as being similar to the Bantustans. Being able to leave them is a privilege not afforded to just anyone.  Palestinians in annexed East Jerusalem were not granted the same rights as Israelis following annexation. They were given ""permanent residency"", which is not the same thing as citizenship, and can be revoked. This is to say nothing of the fact that Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem is in violation of international law. So they annexed an area and then didn\'t give the occupants the same rights as others. They can also lose this residency status, displacing them from their homeland. This is discriminatory.  I actually don\'t find the argument that Israel is an apartheid state to be that convincing all the time, but I can see why people feel that way. My general point with these topics is that Israel is committing ethnic cleansing and discrimination which we shouldn\'t be ok with.  Is the Arab world extremely anti-semitic? Yes, of course! I believe that Islam itself is honestly pretty anti-semitic. That doesn\'t mean that Israel isn\'t also discriminating against Palestinians. And Israel has a lot more power in this fight.   Was the ethnic cleansing of Jews in the Arab wrong? Yes! Does the Arab world owe Jews reparations? Also yes! That doesn\'t mean that the Nakba was ok, and it doesn\'t mean that reparations aren\'t needed.  Is Hamas genocidal? Yes! This doesn\'t mean that Israel should treat Palestinians as if they are a threat just by the nature of their nationality.']"

Fast forward to the 1800s, you’re a cherokee in Georgia, the US government signed a treaty entitling your people a portion of the land there to do govern yourself, Georgian landowners don’t like this, petition the US government to give you a few months to get the fuck out to Oklahoma or they’re gonna force you out, thousands die on the way to Oklahoma. Many are sent to residential schools, whole cultures and languages erased, not considered US citizens until the 20s, get fucked every time.   My point is, looking through life or historical events through the perspective of someone else when considering right or wrong is important as it enables us to gain a better knowledge on why things happened the way they did.

The B2 Spirit\'s first flight was in 1989 but it entered service in 1997.  ""That is a huge gap considering the rate of development in the 60s and 70s.""  True, but you have to remember two things:  1- Aircraft were less complex in the 60\'s and 70\'s. From advanced RAM coatings to connected systems, development takes longer today.  2- The B2 program was started before the cold war ended. Once the Soviet Union collapsed, there really wasn\'t a need to build a newer, more advanced bomber since there was no one to use it against at the time.  ""The B-21 development is driven by politics not a strategic need.""  According to whom? The B2 fleet consists of just 20 aircraft and they are expensive to operate. The B1 fleet consists of about 100 aircraft but they are incredibly maintenance heavy and there are no plans to keep it in service beyond 2038 (assuming it lasts that long).  The B21 is a better aircraft than both. Stealthier than either one, more fuel efficient than either one, it has a connected cockpit unlike the B2, it costs less than the B2 to operate, it will be easier to maintain than the B1, it is capable of being operated unmanned. And most miraculous of all, it\'s actually on time and on budget right now, which was certainly not the case for the B1 or B2.

Instead of making more game they remove some of what they already have and use the rest as bait. The result is an unsatisfying, hollow experience which requires often exorbitant payment to complete.  But that isn\'t a problem with the F2P model or even the transition to F2P, it is a problem rooted in game developers without the money or inclination to create new content to sell.

The threat of force is barely important for the functioning of all hierarchical societies. You make claims but you don’t defend them and, when you do, you fail.   This is word salad. Also not only do people not have to agree on everything, most of them *are not effected by that thing*.   Whatever you think I said doesn’t change the fact that it isn’t a strawman. It’s rich you think your fucking philosophy is the only kind of philosophy or that philosophy has any relevance to the question of “are you moving goalposts”.   Anarchy as “complete chaos” is actually workable and we can recontextualize “chaos” or “order” in all sorts of ways. Historical anarchists have done so, it isn’t as if “anarchy” didn’t mean “chaos” back then.   Not unless the general orders them to. And, by your logic, the people punching them should be in charge not the general because they’re not using violence at all.  See, there is literally no way you could argue that authority is derived from physical violence. It’s just not how things work.   Stop doing what? The general didn’t order them to punch people. He didn’t do anything at all.   This is nothing than a shoddy attempt at backpedaling. You’re arguing that authority is derived from violence but the authority in your situation hasn’t used violence at all.   If they’re using violence because the general ordered them to, the general hasn’t used violence. If they’re using violence because they love the general so much, *the general still didn’t use violence* (and also didn’t use their authority).  Either way, the general isn’t using violence nor, if the soldiers are going rogue, even commanding violence. Therefore the authority they have cannot be derived from violence.  This is another shitty argument that’s just as bad as the last one. You have a completely dogmatic attachment to the idea that authority = force. It’s fucking insane.   That’s circular logic. Their violence is only possible via equipment but they’re using violence to get that equipment? That doesn’t make sense.  In fact, the idea of a general strike relies on the fact that militaries need social support to exist. Without which they would be incapable of accomplishing anything. And equipment would be produced for the working class not rulers since they’re the ones who actually produce it.  Either way you’re wrong, they *buy* it or pay people to produce it. Literally every government does. That’s how thing actually work. Your ideas don’t resemble how reality actually works. That’s why it’s complete bullshit.   It isn’t. It’s achieved through literal houses of cards. Organizations are structured such that they depend on government for their existence. This leads to compliance with governmental authority and.in turn, obtains compliance elsewhere.   Those higher up in organizations and even those lower down don’t have any major incentive to disobey. For those higher up it’s the opposite. And the dominance of hierarchy everywhere along with its reliance upon government forces people to comply.   Yes they are words. Good job! Now read them.  Justification means “acting without consequence”. Any other meanings are non-material and therefore not necessary.   How old are you? You talk like it’s your first day speaking English.', "" I'm not dishonest or violent. It would be more dishonest if I lied. I don't give people personal information on the internet.   That implies there is a hierarchy between us of which there is not.   Having any sort of connection to the conversation. Insults have no substance since they are irrelevant.   No, it's because they are literally in control of your account. Your account isn't some vault or deposit with money. It's a legal fiction which only exists insofar as the government ensures it exists and, because it is a legal fiction, it plays by the government's rules.  Even if you walked in and withdrew all your money before dodging taxes, your account would still be frozen and would still have interest applied to it. You wouldn't be able to go to any bank or do a majority of the financial transactions you need to.  And that heavily impedes your mobility in society. You suddenly are unable to access a majority of the activities and institutions you rely on because all of those institutions or activities utilize banks in some way.   If they don't comply then they won't recognize the bank as legitimate which means it goes out of business. No one in their right mind will keep their money there, no one will invest, and it'll get shut down which means no one could invest or keep their money there even if they wanted to.  And they have no reason not to comply because those in charge of banks directly benefit from things moving as smoothly as possible and from continued obedience to authority. They know their dependency upon government for their existence.  At its core, it's all just ideology. Ideology which turns into practices that they reinforce each other. The inherent interdependency of human beings is what gives hierarchy its power. Not violence or force.   Not physically coercive.   Yes. Physical coercion does not need to be fundamental to hierarchy in order to exist. That's just a fiction your broken, drug-riddled brain produced.   They're systematically coercive but, like I said before, you need voluntary obedience on a day-to-day level for the continued maintenance of hierarchy.  And that's why anarchists oppose *all* hierarchies, including voluntary ones.   Because I am an anarchist. I oppose *hierarchy* not violence. That is the distinction between you and me. You are not an anarchist.  You see no utility in opposing hierarchy if there is no violence. Even if it systematically coercion, as long as there is no physical coercion it's fine.  What a daft notion. So narrow-minded and dogmatic in your adherence to the idea that force is authority that, if it wasn't, you'd be fine with it."", '   I\'m not giving you any personal information. Also that\'s relatively young. Why are you so fucked up?     There you go, nothing of substance is behind your words. Just dogma.    They have been successful but the point is that hierarchy reinforces itself through interlocking social practices. All human beings are interdependent and all social activity relies on other social activity.   As such, if all or most social activity is organized in a particular way, each organization is strengthened by the shared institutions and practices of all the others. This makes opposing hierarchy very difficult.  Coincidentally, if all social activity was organized anarchically, opposing anarchy would be very difficult. That\'s how anarchy defends itself.   Yet that doesn\'t explain which came first. And, unlike the chicken or egg problem, you have no way of explaining how violence could have been first used if there was no capacity to use it.   This is a non-argument. No one is arguing that violence or equipment don\'t both exist, I\'m asking you how could violence be used in the first place if there was no equipment to use it?  If you need lots of social support to produce anything resembling a military, then ""they used a military"" isn\'t an explanation for how that social support was obtained. Because militaries wouldn\'t exist without that social support in the first place.  By the way, doubling down and admitting that your logic is circular is hilarious. The fact that you think there is nothing wrong with circular logic is even more hilarious.   The government doesn\'t force you to pay taxes. The consequence of not paying taxes is the government taking money out of your bank account, putting interest on it, or freezing your assets. In other words, they use their authority over banks or other financial institutions to fuck you over. They don\'t use any violence against you.  The closest they would come to using violence is appropriating your assets and not only is that a last resort but that won\'t happen to you unless you\'ve committed massive tax fraud.    I didn\'t mention it because that\'s not what the consequences of taxation are. You\'re fucking 32 and you don\'t even know what happens if you don\'t pay taxes?   It isn\'t necessary at all. Also I already have. Your arguments thus far have either been:  ""People who obey authority are the same/extensions of authorities""  or  ""Circular logic""  Both of these are laughable and I\'ve already dismissed them. The other arguments you\'ve made depend on literal 5 year old understandings of how government works. Or more specifically, how a 5 year old would understand government if taught by an American libertarian.   No amount of physical coercion could last long enough to actually cause indoctrination. Physical coercion, like direct physical coercion, is absolutely unstable and does not last long period. It isn\'t even a form of organization because the threat must constantly be there and there can be no opening for rebellion (which they are almost always is).  Hierarchies are not based around physical coercion. They are not established by physical coercion. These are claims you continue to fail to defend.   You have no way of dealing with the basic fact that people who are ordered to use violence aren\'t physically coerced. This basic observation is something you\'re incapable of addressing. That alone showcases the stupidity of your ideas.   I\'m the only one here asserting that hierarchy is established and maintained through interconnected and mutually dependent groups or institutions. I\'ve had a systematic perspective the entire time. You only stumbled onto a vaguely ""systematic"" perspective out of sheer goalpost moving.   I have. The military, capitalism, government, patriarchy, etc.    Just because sometimes force is used by people who live in or are a part of social hierarchies does not mean that coercion is a fundamental part of it.  By that logic, eating oranges is a fundamental part of being a police officer because some police officers eat oranges.  This is the equivalent of ""drinking water is bad because Hitler did it"" as if drinking water was a fundamental part of Hitler\'s character.   We\'re not redefining ""chaos"", we\'re extending or recontextualizing what it means. Anarchy is the absence of authority, this is what it actually means most of the time, and people take that to mean chaos but it doesn\'t have to be.  So quit being a fucking idiot with zero critical thinking skills and start actually learning how to read.']"

[There has been an enormous body of research into the effects of gender in language \\(and yes -- it\'s called linguistic gender\\) influence our perceptions of people and the world.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-language-shapes-thought/). There are plenty of languages that gender sexless nouns, use non-gendered pronouns for people, or contain third (or more) grammatically gendered pronouns, and the way we use those pronouns is based on perception and convention. See: ""Psycholinguistic investigations of the way readers and **speakers perceive gender** have shown several biases associated with how gender is linguistically realized in language"" ([Gygax et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31379661/)) [emphasis added]. Furthermore, it is well documented that in natural-gender languages like English, this correlation that you\'re making between sex and gendered pronouns is simply because it\'s been reinforced, and ""grammatical gender itself is not a cultural label but a concept with psychological reality"" ([Samuel et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-019-01652-3)).   We know that gender in language influences our perception of the world psychologically, but the way a person perceives their place in a social group and their concept of self is well-documented to have influence on their well-being and mental health. This has both good and bad implications, obviously, but identification with a social group is important to our psychological perception of the world.   * ""Gender is a key determinant of our self-concept and our perceptions of others. It shapes our mental health, our career paths, and our most intimate relationships"" ([Morgenroth &amp; Ryan](https://oxfordre.com/psychology/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-309;jsessionid=640DFEF1EA7C80F143EAFBEEEB661FDA)). * ""Sexual differentiation of the genitals takes place before sexual differentiation of the brain, making it possible that they are not always congruent"" ([Roselli](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6677266/)).  * ""Whether it is based on sex, skin color, or even determined arbitrarily, membership in a social group exerts a profound influence on human behavior, with both positive and negative implications. Specifically membership in a social group has been shown to promote a positive social identity from which individuals can derive self-esteem and a sense of belongingness or connectedness to others and serve as a buffer during times of stress. However, membership in a social group can also promote negative biases toward out-group members, derogation of in-group members who violate group norms, and disengagement from certain areas in which one’s group has been negatively stereotyped (for example, women and math)"" ([Lurye et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661758/).)   You can call this made up silliness all you want, but here are the facts. Some people have a sincere feeling of themselves that their self-concept of gender doesn\'t match their body. We know that this dysphoria is harmful to them psychologically. When those individuals are allowed to present themselves in a way that match their self-concept and identify with that group, [the rates of depression and sucidality go down](https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext).

It doesn\'t matter whether you believe in the concept of gender identity. It causes harm to people when others do not accept their concept of self.

We should reform our economic system so that it moves away from overconsumption, but we should also recognize as of right now, we have an obligation to not engage in overconsumption or buy from really immoral companies. The environment we live in right now makes it much more likely for people to engage in overconsumption,and that should be changed, but this doesn't mean that anyone's forced to do that as of right now, and we can still ask individuals to be more responsible for their own actions.   There's a relevant difference here. In this scenario, as you stated, it simply isn't possible to have a society of full individual freedom. However, in our modern context, it is absolutely possible for individuals to not engage in overconsumption. Nothing is forcing them to overconsume. Our current economic system just makes it more likely for people to engage in unethical consumerism and overconsumption, and I already agreed our economic system should be reformed to deter this and make it less likely.

Does Jeff Bezos doing a significant thing somehow make the principle ""you ought not encourage people to engage in immoral activities"" untrue? No, that principle is true regardless of whether or not your impact is small or large.

Let\'s say there\'s a non-profit organization which goes into a crime-infested area, and they offer some rehab and jobs training to the criminals. It wouldn\'t really make sense to say ""No, what this non-profit is doing is useless, we should just get the federal government to expand social programs"". Sure, the non-profit isn\'t tackling poverty at large and won\'t make a significant difference, but they should absolutely still do what they\'re doing because that\'s what they should be doing. This is compatible with saying that the government should alleviate poverty.    You still have an obligation to not encourage corporations to dump toxic waster into the ocean, or at the very least, don\'t do it more than you need to.

Disbanding NATO is a little extreme. It's plausible that NATO will become less important over time, because Russia is not a threat. Traditionally the USA was top dog there, because we had the military strength and western europeans believed they could not defend themselves from Russia without us. That belief may be gone now. We'll see.   It sounds like you're unclear on the concept. Generals generally try to be ready to refight the last war. If they lost the last war, they realize they need to do something different. But doing something different costs more than maintaining an existing approach.   Yes, we had no concept how we could create a peace. We never caught up to reality. Our OODA loop was around 6 months, so every 6 months we would notice that our existing approach wasn't working, and we'd announce a new approach which would take 6 months to confirm also didn't work.   But that's military strategy, which is below Congress's pay grade. Congress can mostly increase funding or decrease funding. In recent decades Congress has always increased funding. We can discuss why.    I don't know. I hope we don't.   China is our main excuse to increase military spending. We are in an arms race with them. But if we aren't going to fight them, why would their military spending affect ours?  Maybe we could fight them to defend Taiwan. But China probably won't invade Taiwan. If they do that, they can expect to win a smoking ruin. They do better to get Taiwan to reconcile with them. MAYBE they will attack Taiwan, but I don't think our CIA knows how to make them do that. We were effective at getting Russia to invade Ukraine, but I doubt we could make China invade Taiwan.  Our deep-water Navy is much better than China's and probably will be until there's some big new breakthrough. Aircraft carriers beat battleships, and nothing has beat aircraft carriers yet. Except they are so very expensive and slow to build, so we spend more and more resources defending them instead of attacking with them. Anyway, if the time comes that some new technology makes them fail -- a big swarm of cheap drones, say -- we won't give up on them until at least one of them is sunk or badly damaged, and then we will panic and start crash programs of various sorts. I can't predict when that will happen.  It seems extremely unlikely that China will invade the USA. Would they go through Siberia and Alaska and Canada? So to have the big war that we're preparing for -- that is the only possible military justification for our bloated military budget -- we would have to invade them.    I doubt it. It bothers me that our government leaders don't either. I look at what they do, and I can only hope that it makes no sense.

What I found jn both instances was that cash became a very powerful tool for buying big ticket items, even if you aren’t spending as much on those items.  It’s the expansion of your own debt that you need to watch in good economic times, and especially when times are uncertain.  It became very hard to in 2009 and for a few years after, even, as lending standards tightened up.    I expect that the GFC was an extreme outlier in its severity, but I also know that the “recession” of 2020 was not nearly as significant as it might have been.  I understand that the recession of 1980-1981 was quite significant as well, and I recall my parents tightening up their spending a lot, though I was just then school age.  That’s more what I expect this go ‘round.  Lending on big ticket purchases will be very difficult, think homes and cars, and the unemployment number might be quite elevated, 6-8%.  Could be worse than that, but I believe a demographic shift has occurred the past 2-4 years, with much of the older workforce stepping away for what they hope is forever.    For investors, being ready to deploy capital will be imperative.  For those of us “little people”, we need to have 3-6 months of our bills saved up in liquid cash.  If one’s job and income holds steady throughout, yeah, great opportunity to perhaps score a home or a used auto for what will seem like a “deal” compared to the inflation in everything these past couple years.', ""Ok how about this. The Fed becomes a national public bank. Anyone can deposit savings at the Fed and get the current interest rate. Additionally, it makes loans against good collateral and to those with good credit. Naturally these loans will be rather conservative - mostly home loans and direct business investment. We'll also increase democratic control, possibly with different branches so that state and local governments can exercise some control over what loans get made. This gets rid of the private banks as middlemen, although there will still be a role for private banks to make investments, since the public bank will not lend to riskier projects and borrowers.  Ask for expanding the money supply, well, the federal government already does this when it spends. I don't see any particular reason why we should make some kind of rule like 3% annually - if Congress feels that the economy needs to be stimulated, they can increase the deficit, and vice versa. As flawed as this process can sometimes be, I still would prefer to have more direct democratic control over how new money is spent, rather than leaving it up to an institution that is more removed from democratic oversight.  Of course, the FED will still have a similar balance sheet to what it has right now. The money that you and I deposit at the FED will show up on their balance sheet as a liability, as it must, because of course, that is money they owe you. I don't see this as a problem at all, and in fact I don't see any alternative. Dollars will and must be obligations of the government which can be redeemed for our own obligation to the government (i.e. the tax liability).  The really big change here would be to allow holders of dollars to directly use and benefit from the public monetary infrastructure we have set up. By making the Fed public, or even setting up an entirely new public bank, we can bypass the private banking cartel and have a monetary system that is responsive to democratic control, more transparent, and can serve the general needs of the public at large. Do you think that would be a positive change that would address at least some of your concerns?"", "" Right off the bat, I would like to point out that the effect of interest rates on the marginal propensity to save and invest is much harder to deduce empirically than the macroeconomic wisdom would suggest. Additionally, since the majority of Bank lending is against real estate, most of the action has to take place through the so-called wealth effect. Again, it's tough to show a strong empirical relationship here.  Additionally, while raising interest may slow Bank lending to some degree, it increases government deficit spending. If government deficit spending increases more than the decrease in private credit creation, then the policy ends up being inflationary rather than deflationary. The bigger the government deficit, the truer this is. And I don't think I have to tell you that government deficits have been pretty high in recent history.  But okay, let's assume there IS a deflationary impact from raising interest rates. Let's assume that Banks start lending less to businesses, and consumers start taking on less debt (which is directly contrary to the recent evidence that shows an INCREASE, not a decrease, in private sector debt, but w/e). How is this supposed to help the economically precarious who are living paycheck to paycheck? They have little to no savings, so the incentives to save vs invest mean very little. Meanwhile, decreased investment and demand means higher unemployment. Even if we manage to get prices under control, it comes at the expense of the material well-being of all the newly unemployed people. People with good job security might benefit from this, but the most disposable and economically precarious workers will be hurt the most. So this ends up being a pretty regressive policy.  You can see this even more clearly when you look at who hire interest rates benefit, i.e., savers. Raising interest rates is a policy choice to give people with money free interest income from Treasury securities. It clearly benefits the most those with the most money to save. In a relatively unequal society like ours, where the wealth is already flowing increasingly to a smaller and smaller number of people at the very top, why would we want such a regressive policy?  If inflation is the problem, interest rates are not the answer. First, because interest rate policy is clearly just not super effective at controlling inflation. Second, it is a regressive policy that prioritizes the wealth of the already well off over the material well-being of the worst off.  To the extent that inflation is a problem, the solution is not monetary but fiscal policy. By tightening the fiscal stance in a progressive manner, we can reduce or reverse the growth of the money supply while making sure that it does not come at the cost of the material well-being of the most vulnerable in our society. It may seem difficult or even impossible to find the political will to do this; nonetheless, it is the only real effective solution. Interest rate policy is the fed's hammer, and it will use it whether or not it is truly the right tool for the job. But the true fiscal power lies with Congress.""]"
