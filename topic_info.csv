That what began as a liberal revolution in the 18 th century, they made unprecedented gains in overthrowing monarchy globally, soon shifted to a rearguard action where they began defending what they had gained rather than pushing forward with further gains.  A radical creed became in this way a conservative defensive, over time. The liberals of that day abandoned radicalism, thinking that society would evolve naturally over the next eons towards liberty, under the cultural influence of darwinism.  He specifically singles out Herbert Spencer as emblematic of this ideological shift.  But I think the problem of that day was primarily a deficit in theory. They did not have adequate theory to understand how to apply the principle of liberty any further than they had achieved.  The old regime was overthrown because they knew very well what they were against, but they did not know well what kind and shape of society could be built that was in line with the philosophy of liberty.  Only with the resurgence of liberty ideology after WW2 with Rothbard, Friedman, and Mises do we get a resurgence of theory such as arguably hadn't been occurring for a few decades, or with only a few figures.  During that time, the mantle of the radical opposition group was taken up by the Marxists, who are unfortunately a false revolution.  And I would say that's the main reason why we have trouble getting off the ground currently, people who recognize there's something wrong with the system are too often being driven towards Marxism as the solution, whereas they used to be driven into classical liberalism ideas.  For a resurgence of liberty philosophy, it may be necessary for socialism to first die or be rejected as a liberal creed.  But that's not happening, and in fact it grows like some kind of virus. Because it feeds on the wrongs of the current system.""]"

The points still stand in general though, since conservatives are largely against sex education and easy access to contraceptives.   The overwhelming majority of anti-abortion people are religious, the entire movement is founded by modern religious groups. Once they die out, so will their ""cause"".   It\'s not alive, it\'s not the same as killing a baby that\'s alive. It seems like you\'re aiming for a ""gotcha"" here by pointing out that you can be charged with murder for causing the unwanted termination of a fetus, but that does not conflict with abortion. Abortion is the choice of the woman carrying the baby, kicking a pregnant woman is not the woman\'s choice, and that\'s why there is a law against it. That same law even has a provision explicitly stating that it does not apply when a woman consents to have an abortion.', ' All women are marginalized in a forced birth society, and women who would have been alive aside from abortion bans are killed BY YOU.  Just because sometimes people die naturally does not make killing women okay. Would you accept it if I told you that abortion is perfectly fine because sometimes fetuses die?   FORCED pregnancy is not okay.   FORCED pregnancy is not okay. FORCED pregnancy is rape. You seek to rape and kill women through FORCED pregnancy.   Some people may have a heart attack naturally but it\'s not okay to deliberately give someone a heart attack.  Some people may die naturally but it\'s not okay to kill them.

Do you beat your wife to a pulp every night? Do you go around raping every woman you see? Why not? it\'s not killing us. Praise modern medicine! Amirite?   ANd when you FORCE a woman to stay pregnant and give birth, she is neither choosing to stay pregnant or accepting that risk. If she dies, YOU KILLED HER.   And you\'re perfectly fine with killing us in forced childbirth. You are pro-killing-women. Just say it. Just say that you want us dead.   It is if you\'re KILLING SOMEONE THROUGH FORCED BIRTH.

Say you\'re not in favor of protecting ALL life because you want women dead.   Allowing abortions allows women to get abortions and avoid childbirth. Abortion is far far safer than childbirth, and allowing every woman who wants an abortion to get one ensures that nobody is FORCED to risk death.   You don\'t, because they don\'t work. Women still die and you are fine with it. You say ""some women die, and it\'s tragic,"" and shrug and walk away. You rationalize it by saying it\'s perfectly fine to visit any level of violence on a woman you want--you may rape us, beat us, maim us, brutalize us--as long as you don\'t *kill* us.

""Our deaths are tragic but THINK OF THE BABIES,"" you say. ""I\'m fine with you dying,"" you say. Just admit it. Just own it. You\'re just as much of a murderer as you think I am.

I'm not only pro choice I'm actively pro abortion.  It is a fantastic medical procedure that is a great thing to be available to a society.  Being pregnant and giving birth even if you plan to give it up for adoption is a life changing and stressful thing not to mention it can wreck your body.  Abortions have also prevented millions of kids being born into absolute terrible situations with basically zero chance of growing up normal and living a normal life.  If the adoption system in America and foster homes in this country weren't a giant cluster fuck I might lean a little more towards giving up for an adoption.  Not to mention lots of people get pregnant at a point in their life where having and raising a kid is not really an option.  Abortions have helped millions of people.  Again, a clump of cells that relies on being connected to a human to survive is not a person and is not alive.  You nut jobs can are somehow unable to understand this.  Let's assume they are, though. You have no thoughts or recollection of any of that.  It's really not a life.  If someone aborted me at 7 months I'd never have even realized it.  Also, assume abortion was made federally illegal.  What's your grand plan for all of these millions of kids born into terrible situations or given up for adoption?  You realize most people getting abortions aren't soccer moms that live in the suburbs, right?  They are poor people or people in bad situations that realize they are not in a situation to raise a child.  So you think the best option is basically force millions of people into a poor life of struggling and suffering vs aborting something that has no memory, thoughts, and will never even know they were going to exist and is the best option for all parties involved?  Get the fuck out of here with that ridiculousness.  If you don't agree with abortion then that's perfectly OK. Don't facilitate one or be with someone that approves of them.  But stay the fuck out of everyone else's life and ability to make this decision for themselves because in your opinion it's wrong.

You made something or performed a service and you sold that for its market value.  The founders would not recognize a person who sells their labor on an hourly basis (because they lack the means to create saleable product) as a free person.      Capitalism took root in America during the railroad revolution, and that put the new wageslave system in to direct competition with southern chattel slavery.      Advantages to wageslaves are that they have to pay for their own housing, food and medical care and a wageslave who is unable to work due to illness or injury presents no liability for the enterprise. They can be replaced.  You don't get stuck owning a slave who is injured, or can no longer produce a full day of work.    Most importantly the wageslave system outcompeted traditional slavery because wageslaves work harder, believing it to be in their interest as they seek advancement.     But because the American wage system evolved to fulfill the same production needs as slavery it's not like work systems in the rest of the world.  It's primary advantages were severability of employment, and that owners had no need to provide for living conditions.    The ability for business owners to maximize profit while providing as little as possible to workers is the foundation of American capitalism."", ' I think for something to be considered a ""criticism"" of a certain economic system, it doesn\'t necessarily have to be exclusive to that economic system, but that the downside or ""con"" is much more apparent in one over the other.  Humans don\'t magically stop being greedy under other economic systems. For example, in a market socialist system (system in which there are a bunch of companies that compete with one another \\[similar to capitalism\\] but each business is collectively owned and operated by the workers of that specific business rather than a single individual or a group of wealthy shareholders), people are still greedy and will still act in their self interest. But, due to businesses being owned collectively amongst the workers, the profits of that business are more evenly shared and thus wealth inequality is lower and thus it is a lot more difficult for any one individual to easily corrupt the political system. Is it still \\*technically\\* possible for there to be corruption in a market socialist system? Yes....but it is much harder and much less likely.  The fact that capitalism makes it more likely that the political system and politicians can become corrupted makes it a valid criticism imo.', 'TL;DR stay a western shit-lib   If you actually read the content of those conversations where I ask for sources you’d find that they often have a running theme of me calling out people who make outlandish claims about communist political and economic topics. Ironic considering your commentary.   I will not deny I have not read The Civil War in France (1870) yet but besides that there’s nothing else you have said that has been further from the truth so fuck off with your profiling.  You said Marx had a different view of the Dictatorship of the proletariat from what MLs claim it to be. You also gave a very poor characterization of what MLs believe the DOTP to be. I detest people who do this type of shit then give a fucking Wikipedia article as their reference. The more politically charged a topic is the more a knowledge database where supposedly EVERYONE can contribute to the development of it has so many holes in how a communist could just take it with a grain of salt. Quotes can be cherry picked so easily it’s just more irony of the situation considering your original call out was about taking Marx out of context.   Lenin has already said plenty about the counter arguments posed by Kautsky in the 2nd International regarding Marx’s commentary on the DOTP (which is where you’re getting this from whether you’re aware of it or not):  ”Let us point out, in passing, that when calling the non-Bolsheviks in Russia, i.e., the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, socialists, Kautsky was guided by their name, that is, by a word, and not by the actual place they occupy in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. What a wonderful understanding and application of Marxism!”  “The question of the dictatorship of the proletariat is a question of the relation of the proletarian state to the bourgeois state, of proletarian democracy to bourgeois democracy. One would think that this is as plain as a pikestaff. But Kautsky, like a schoolmaster who has become as dry as dust from quoting the same old textbooks on history, persistently turns his back on the twentieth century and his face to the eighteenth century, and for the hundredth time, in a number of paragraphs, in an incredibly tedious fashion chews the old cud over the relation of bourgeois democracy to absolutism and medievalism!”  “But this means he utterly fails to understand what is what! One cannot help smiling at Kautsky’s effort to make it appear that there are people who preach “contempt for democracy” (p. 11) and so forth. That is the sort of twaddle Kautsky uses to befog and confuse the issue, for he talks like the liberals, speaking of democracy in general, and not of *bourgeois democracy*[my italics]; he even avoids using this precise, class term, and, instead, tries to speak about “presocialist” democracy. This windbag devotes almost one-third of his pamphlet, twenty pages out of sixty-three, to this twaddle, which is so agreeable to the bourgeoisie, for it is tantamount to embellishing bourgeois democracy, and obscures the question of the proletarian revolution.”  This view” (which Kautsky dubs “contempt for democracy”) “rests upon a single word of Karl Marx’s”. This is what Kautsky literally says on page 20. And on page 60 the same thing is repeated even in the form that they (the Bolsheviks) “opportunely recalled the little word” (that is literally what he says—des Wörtchens!!) “about the dictatorship of the proletariat which Marx once used in 1875 in a letter”.  Here is Marx’s “little word"":   First of all, to call this classical reasoning of Marx’s, which sums up the whole of his revolutionary teaching, “a single word” and even “a little word,” is an insult to and complete renunciation of Marxism. It must not be forgotten that Kautsky knows Marx almost by heart, and, judging by all he has written, he has in his desk, or in his head, a number of pigeon-holes in which all that was ever written by Marx is most carefully filed so as to be ready at hand for quotation. Kautsky must know that both Marx and Engels, in their letters as well as in their published works, repeatedly spoke about the dictatorship of the proletariat, before and especially after the Paris Commune. Kautsky must know that the formula “dictatorship of the proletariat” is merely a more historically concrete and scientifically exact formulation of the proletariat’s task of “smashing” the bourgeois state machine, about which both Marx and Engels, in summing up the experience of the Revolution of 1848, and, still more so, of 1871, spoke for forty years, between 1852 and 1891.”   [All of this and plenty more can be found in the 1st chapter of Lenin’s *The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/common_liberal.htm)   I doubt you will read all of this much like you won’t read that book but I’m plenty read on the subject of the dictatorship of the proletariat. How about you sit down with your pseudo-intellectual garbage like the rest of the anarchists and put your head down and do the actual reading.']"

Labor unions and entitlements support the poor and those in need, the very wealthy were thought of as being against their values, and the authoritarians resemble those who have harmed christians and even Jesus himself. The Bible literally teaches that excess should be given to those without, and any politician who espoused such beliefs would gain favor with the christians.

That is actually Jesus right in front of you, I'm sure you've met him many times. You won't find him in the church because that isn't where he lives.  And that really stuck with me."", 'Yes of course! As Paul says when sin increased grace increased all the more and Paul should know. He called himself ""chief of sinners"" because of the time he spent hunting and murdering Christians.  The problem is that twisting scripture in small ways can lead to disastrous outcomes. This exact thing has happened with many scriptures. Where this conversation was going was ""well we\'re all sinners so does [this] sin even matter?"" Views that make light of sin always lead to sin .It\'s been the same discussion for almost 2 thousand years now. ""Well wouldn\'t more sin mean more grace?"" Paul responds to this in Romans 6.  What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 2 By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 3 Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.  Notice the exclamation mark after by no means. It\'s not very common in scripture. The words are very strong in the greek.   Anyone who would wish to be a Christian must understand the danger of sin and choose a life of fighting to be free of it by the spirit. Scripture tells us that those who take sin lightly either don\'t understand the high price that was paid for redemption or don\'t appreciate it anyway (hebrews 10:29) and will lose the grace given to them. Christ paid a high price with his own blood and suffering. The word excruciating was created to describe the unimaginable pain of literally tearing your body apart as you fight to take a breath (the cross actually kills by asphyxiation). He gave everything to put an end to sin. He expects people to respect the gravity of the situation   But yes all sin can be redeemed but twisting scripture to make certain sins look less dangerous only leads to dangerous places. If you want to know more the Book of 1 John that was half about this subject to address a similar lie that was putting greek believers in danger. Basically greeks had found a round about way of saying that if you sin it\'s really just you\'re body doing it and your not guilty of anything.

Whether or not those laws are legal on the state level is for the courts to decide, but just like it's not illegal for a senator or congressman to propose something which is unconstitutional, it's also not illegal for the federal government to try and pressure States into enacting laws that are illegal in the state but would be arguably beneficial anyway.   Trump had been talking about the possibility of the Democrats illegally stealing the election from him ever since he did poorly in the 2018 midterms. Fear that he was going to try and do something illegal was absolutely precedented and reasonable because the man has shown on numerous occasions that any and all institutions of this country mean nothing to him so long as he can get more power, evident again by the fact that he literally said he wanted to overturn the Constitution and be installed as dictator.   No it isn't, Twitter has not revealed anything which even comes close to legitimizing your dominion voting machine bs. All its revealed is that there is an incredibly unhealthy and detrimental relationship between mass media institutions and the government, something which has been true and evident since mass media came into existence and is not in any way unique to this election whatsoever nor did it uniquely affect this election whatsoever. It isn't still in debate, you're just full of shit and the fact that you and people like you can be convinced of something this insane is honestly one of the greatest threats to the United States today. After all if you can be convinced of this then you can frankly be convinced of anything by anyone with an R next to their name.   Not true at all. Practically all crime happens predominantly in cities because that's where you just have the most people squished the most closely together. Of course there's going to be more crime when you have a hundred people in a room rather than five. That doesn't imply anything about the political leanings of the criminals, but what does imply something about the political leanings of the criminals was the degree to which right-wing pundits such as those on Fox News and even Donald Trump himself went out of his way to convince people that it was a bio-weapon that was developed and released specifically to attack the United States.   You are being extremely over-dramatic, all questioning wasn't banned. People who were very prominently spreading the worst and most extreme and unfounded of conspiracy theories were deprioritized in the algorithm, and everyone else had a little notation put under their post explaining to readers why the post is wrong.

If one doesn't consider the project already failed and more or less ceded to the Russian Federation.   Most of the communists, those of a more international position, who were associated with the projects of Lugansk and Donetsk republics have fled, hid or died in various assassinations and artillery shellings. The communists were seen as the larger threat, as they specifically addressed ethnic Ukrainians in the Ukrainian language in their propaganda. They were primary targets of the post-coup Ukrainian government. For them, Donetsk and Lugansk were supposed to be successors of a legitimate Ukrainian SR, that could potentially grow if more people rebelled against the coup. The Dugin-influenced patsoc's are more friendly to the Russian Federation. Safety for ethnic Russians, rather than socialism, is the core of their position, so they get better protection from Russia. They have become the primary political force in the separatist regions.   While these ethnically Russian Patsoc's are obviously quite wrong, and dangerous to minorities in Russia, they did not spring from nowhere. There are tens of thousands of stateless ethnic Russians who were denied citizenship and rights in various post-soviet states, including Ukraine, and lacked the means to go somewhere else at their own expense, as was demanded by the new states. While there is plenty to be said for Russian imperialism before the revolution and their status as a dominant or preferred ethnicity in conquered territory, and for chauvinist attitudes in later years, that is not the universal experience. It also doesn't help that they adopt a nostalgia for the Soviet Union and its imagery, but without socialist politics, which is shallow and deceptive.   At best, one could argue that they make the necessary compromises to mobilize ethnic Russians against western capitalist influence. At worst, and I'm quite pessimistic, they belong to capitalists more fully than they admit and lack revolutionary potential on the basis of that ethnocentrism.

On Feb. 23, hours before the invasion began, Sandworm took another swing, launching malware that infected several hundred Ukrainian government computers, officials said. The intrusion was detected quickly, the damage contained.  Then Sandworm struck again. But the code it used looked like it had been thrown together at the last minute, with programming errors — another fail.  Sandworm wasn’t done. In its boldest stroke yet, it went after the Ukrainian military’s satellite communications, used by soldiers in the field. It worked, and by 6:15 a.m. on Feb. 24, the system went down, right at Ukraine’s most vulnerable moment.  It could have been a crippling blow. But the Ukrainian government had a backup plan: a separate satellite communications system, which it had tested only two months before, to make sure it was ready in the event of a Russian invasion.    ...  Ukrainian law enforcement officials started noticing something else suspicious as well: a spike in foreign cellphone numbers near the border, in the forests between Ukraine and Belarus.  Russian soldiers were using cellphones to call home, and suddenly popping up on Ukrainian networks. Officials who monitor the traffic during peacetime for criminal activity quickly realized they could see and hear the invaders approaching in real time.  “We listened to the Russian soldiers as they panicked and called their friends and relatives,” said an official who oversees the phone intercepts. “They used ordinary phones to make decisions about their further moves.”  Down long corridors guarded by locks with facial detection, behind doors sealed with wax to detect intruders, teams of women tracked the Russian troops from small listening booths while their friends and relatives grabbed rifles to patrol the streets.  “We understood where the enemy was, what numbers they were using,” the official said.  The eavesdroppers passed the details to Ukraine’s armed forces to carry out ambushes and counterattacks. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, said Ukrainian forces used cellphone signals and even TikTok videos to target a unit of Chechen soldiers known as the Kadyrovtsy, named for the strongman leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.  It took 40 minutes from the time one video was uploaded to pinpoint the unit’s location near the Hostomel airport northwest of Kyiv, Mr. Budanov said. The Ukrainian military then hit them with three Tochka-U ballistic missiles, he said.  The Russians kept closing in on Kyiv, forcing the eavesdroppers tucked in listening rooms to make a quick decision: destroy their equipment and flee for their own safety, or hang on and continue gathering intelligence.  They stayed.  “We didn’t lose Ukraine. We didn’t let the enemy move further,” the official said. “On the first days, when they made foolish mistakes, we used their foolish mistakes to our advantage.”"", 'If El Paso had been embroiled in a separatist movement for 8 years yeah I really wouldn\'t have a problem with it, especially if not allowing El Paso to be independent meant the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives, massive damage to US infrastructure, and a decades spanning crippled economy. The Donbas and Eastern Ukraine has always been a contested area, even in the original elections those areas went to Ukraine by margins so narrow that in the US we would have held special elections for in many areas. Let\'s not pretend that these areas were the same as the rest of Ukraine, that Putin ever voiced interest in any area outside of these hotly contested areas, or that the people in these areas don\'t blame Ukraine for the war and not the Russians. You don\'t even have to read Russian sources, the financial times conducted interviews in Bakhmut and even the Ukrainian military in the area said that was a common sentiment in the area.   Let\'s also not forget that Zelensky ran on a platform of making peace with the Russians and ran on that platform but proceeded to do the opposite due to pressure from the West.   For the record I don\'t believe NATO troops are in Ukraine or that Ukraine is full of Nazis, I do believe that these areas of Ukraine have wanted independence for a long time, have fought for this independence for a long time, and that Ukraine doesn\'t really care all that much about these areas since they conducted shelling operations in these areas the day before the Russian invasion in violation of the Minsk accords. About dictators today that we support, Egypt? Saudi Arabia? Alegeria? Afghanistan (hardly a democracy, run by a warlord before that fell apart)? There are quite a few oppressive regimes and dictatorships we fund.  As for the Belt and Road initiative, how exactly is increasing a military budget going to help solve that? Are we going to start bombing countries for having Chinese funded infrastructure projects? It\'s not as though the Chinese government is sending its military to these places, they are using money and deals to gain and exercise power, and that\'s not something we can stop with guns and missiles. We can\'t just send soldiers to a country\'s port and say ""we own this now"", we\'d look like thugs because that\'s exactly what we would be.   Yes Russia is making friends in Iran and Syria. What the hell else do you expect them to do? We have cut them off from the rest of the world. We create enemies with our attempts at ""spreading democracy"" which is just code for ""we just want people in charge who we are friends with"" then cry and panic when it fails and other countries who we don\'t like make friends with the countries we made enemies out of. There is a reason why the Iranians don\'t like us and that\'s because we did a regime change in the 40\'s, the Syrians don\'t like us for the same reason.   Yes, as a NYC resident and native I\'m well aware of 9/11, but had our government exercised any competency it never would have happened, it was a preventable tragedy. All the whole war on terror, aka America\'s pissing contest with Islamofascists, did was make more people side with the Islamofascists because when your family is killed in a drone attack you lose all sympathy you may have had for some Americans that died in the WTC. Also, who was supporting the Taliban, Al-Queda, ISIS, and all these other groups before they attacked the US???? The US. WE CREATE OUR OWN PROBLEMS. The interventionism inevitably fails because we back losing causes, we increase resentment towards us, and our takeaway is that next time we should intervene harder. We are chasing the illusion that every country we dislike is like Nazi Germany and that if we win we can create a functional liberal democracy like we did there.   I think you overestimate Ukraine and misunderstand the Russian strategy, blitzing quickly may have been the original strategy but ever since April the new strategy has been the war of attrition, camp the positions, abandon areas that aren\'t defendable, and wait out Ukraine and it\'s working. Ukraine is running out of weapons, the new ones they are getting although more advanced cannot be maintained in the Ukraine and have to be sent to Germany for repairs (as the people who know how to fix them cannot be in Ukraine as the Russians would treat it as an act of war) and this will only further stress the already overworked supply lines into Ukraine. 100 billion dollars spent and can we really say that they caused 100 billion in damages to the Russian military or prevented 100 Billion dollars in damages to their own country? Most of Ukraine\'s energy grid is in the crapper, most are on the brink of starving or freezing this winter, is this what victory looks like? Was all this worth it?   I also think you overestimate effect of sanctions on Russia and underestimate the undeniably worse effect they have had on the West. Europe is going through an energy crisis, fertilizer increased in cost substantially, there are food shortages across the world. We have also permanently ensured that Russia will never rejoin the global financial system no matter who is in power because of the animosity we created by ceasing the assets of Russian civilians abroad. Now Russia and china are creating their own financial system which they will use with their new friends in the middle east to trade oil, which is a massive blow to the dollar.   I love America, I love the country, I love it\'s people, I love the constitution. What I don\'t love is our insane approach to foreign policy and our indifference towards the horrors of the wars we cause and escalate. If we stayed out of political conflicts in countries we don\'t understand and focused our efforts on development and improving our own country we wouldn\'t have these problems.']"

That’s not how it works. Shotguns will be next and then it’ll all be illegal. Look at canada.    A car you need nothing to buy one. To drive on the road you need that stuff. I already said that. And that’s how guns are also regulated in most states. You need a permit to carry concealed in public.   “Prove you’re not a criminal and mentally competent” to prove I’m not a criminal all I need is a background check ,which is already a federal law and to prove someone is mentally competent how is that done?

You’re saying to just put in place common sense laws and it’ll end there but it doesn’t end there they keep pushing for more until all firearms are banned and now we get to the true belief that you’re ok with all firearms being banned eventually. So this idea of “we only want common sense gun laws” is bs.  I live in California and it started with “common sense gun law” and now we have laws that literally make 0 sense and everyone with 2 brain cells think they’re stupid. Even anti gun people think they’re stupid.  They tried to basically ban permitted concealed carry when concealed carriers have never been linked to any type of gun violence. It’s nonsense.

If you fix the root of the problem there’s a high probability that you wouldn’t have to take gun rights away.   The idea of FREEDOM I CAN OWN WHAT I WANT has nothing to do with the point I’m making about semi automatics that you’re also not addressing.   You act like other countries around the world all live in total harmony with no one being victimized. In a lot of these countries you can’t even defend yourself without being put on trial for murder because they don’t even let you defend yourself. Canada had hardly any violence in the first place and they started with “common sense gun laws” and now they’re pretty much banning all guns in canada lol. You also act like everyone in those countries agree with those laws which they don’t.   Weve had “military style weapons” for over a hundred years.  Gun ownership in America has risen drastically and overall violence has dropped drastically over the years. You’re just really not addressing any points I’m making here.   What do you propose is going to solve this problem ? Mental health checks and banning all semi automatic weapons ? Because it goes from “common sense” to banning almost everything pretty fast.  This is an issue where people advocating for gun laws know nothing about firearms and that’s clearly the case here with you. You should learn about something you’re advocating for before forming an opinion imo. Learn about the way firearms work and you’ll quickly figure out how this plays out. You either ban almost everything or nothing at all. There really is no inbetween.']

Obviously, the general public doesn\'t have access to the kind of information that would go into such a decision; 90% of what management does is behind-the-scenes stuff that the customer neither knows nor cares about. Musk, assuming he\'s not even more of a fraud than I believe, *knows* this.  Even if that wasn\'t the case, throwing up a random Twitter poll one day isn\'t how you\'d do this. You\'d make sure that your userbase (or at least the subset you care about) would actually know to respond, and have some context behind what was going on.  So *obviously,* it\'s just another stupid stunt - one that has no real weight, but gives Musk the attention that he apparently needs to live, wrapped up in the pretense that it\'s going to do anything more than stroke his ego for five minutes. Oh, and of *course* he\'s going to point back to this one, stupid Twitter poll anytime somebody points out that he\'s killing the company.  It\'s just...

He is not stupid, regardless of what media tells you.  Who ever said anything about right/left? Are you that fucking programmed? That is NOT what we are discussing here in this conversation. He (Elon Musk) himself explained his political leanings. That he is a leftist, but they went so far left that he can no longer support ""the new thing."" He is left of center, meaning he respects a man\'s right to make money (through billions in government subsidies). He obviously had problems with how things were run. Sent data to two dependable journalists, and had them draw their own conclusions about what went down. He then looked for an excuse to suspend the accounts of some left-leaning journalists, and all hell broke loose, and the conversation changed. He did that to force their hand, which is now being picked up on by this in alt media, and individuals all over the world. This is a ""long con,"" son, and has nothing to do with the quick flip people are making it out to be.  He isn\'t alienating anybody. He is making people play their hands. Watch when the water settles. He is giving birth, and it is turbulent and painful, but when it is all over, with a little slap on the back, everyone will be rejoicing. He is preventing totalitarianism. Please, honestly, think for yourself, and read. Read good books, not the newspapers.', 'He really doesn\'t though. He\'s far from a megalomaniac. Do you guys seriously not see that your ( By ""your"" I mean the prevailing sentiment that is average of liberals as a collective I obviously can\'t speak for any of you individually)  hate for Musk seems to correlate with your leaders taking issue  with him.When your leaders take issue with or support something the media you consume will get busy indoctrination you with said perspective. This happens through repetition and through the affirmation from your peers who are being subjected to the same narrative.  This is true for both sides.   If you cannot see the inherent bias in your media and the flaws in your leaders as well as the positives in the opposition then its safe to say you\'ve been compromised and your being influenced, if not outright manipulated. Again this is true for most people regardless of their political leanings.   The reason why this is so Cleary the case with Musk is because most people give the see vague reasons why they dislike him.  Truth is he\'s bizzare because he\'s a very unique individual,  a one off,.he\'s highly intelligent in certain areas but lacks social intelligence.  This is actually extremely common for people like him.  People  talk crap about him being some elitist billionaire or being a narcissist or megalomaniac. He\'s none of those things.... well he is definitely a billionaire but other than his jet which honestly is a necessity when you are a CEO of a larğge and rapidly expanding international company.  But other than that he\'s not ai typical of some elitist D-bag billionaire.   Musk has enough money for neither him or his family to ever need to work again. I seriously mean never. Not his kids ,grandkids, great grand  kids etc. Yet all he does is work . For a while he had a tiny home  that he\'d stay in at the space X launch pad but I\'ve heard many talk about him often sleeping on the factory floor so he can keep getting things done if it calls for it.  He\'s singlehandedly responsible for the wide adoption of Evs. Because the innovations they\'ve made have  lowers  costs significantly.  They make great products that people enjoy and that will last a long time. Not only that but each of their products has the potential to make its owner money. But they have to make great products because they have no marketing department. When\'s the last time you\'ve seen a Tesla add or dealership? They don\'t have them which is friggin insane, completely unheard of for any large corporate producer of any product. This is why a socially awkward Musk is always stirring things up and causing a buzz with his tweets.Henis Teslas marketing department. That fact alone saves the company 100s of millions as year.  There\'s also the fact that once you understand his vision and how all of the products all of his companies are meant to be integrated. His vision of the future is a good one too. While billionaires like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates claim to be about the environment ,in reality that aren\'t. Instead they are about control.  All their ideas involve more regulations, less freedom for us,and more control for them. You\'ve got Gates preaching deportation and trying to get everyone to leave rural areas cand consolidate into major cities. Conveniently this will make people easier to control. But while he preaches that he\'s busy buying up as much farmland as he cN get his hands on. Gates is now the largest owner of farms in the country. This is a very bad thing. I mean it\'s already bad enough that the vast majority of all products at the grocery store are owned by only a handful  of companies. Imagine if only a handful grow all the food. Talk about power.1😬 Swab is preaching the great reset saying ""you\'ll own nothing but be happy "" All of their visions for our future are ones where all of us have to be OK with having significantly less while they get more. Musk on the other hand has a vision where things in the future are more decentralized so they give power to each individual rather than for him and his billionaire buddies Ike Gates and Schwab want.  Musk doesn\'t care about money or power. His motivation is one of impact. He wants to change the world in a significantly meaningful way. Sure you could  say that alone is selfish because he could be motivated by wanting ro be remembered and leaving  a legacy, but who doesn\'t want that?  All I want to know is where we\'re you guys when Twitter and FB were deliberately censoring or silencing people in order to manipulate people into voting for the candidates they back. This means that liberals were obviously the ones who were indoctrinated. That doesn\'t make you mad? Musk just released a ton of files show the blatant corruption and collision between liberal politicians and social media.  Coincidentally it was after he did this that they began attacking Musk hardcore. And all of you are now doing their bidding.  It\'s crazy. Why are all of you so obsessed with Musk...wait until he gets things dialed and reveals the real reason why he bought Twitter.....it\'s friggin genius and will benefit all of us greatly.  Yet you guys run around parroting concerns and hating on someone you don\'t even know and whose actions do no harm to you whatsoever. Hate all you want, it\'s what unsuccessful people do. Just understand that a wolf cares not of the opinions of sheep. Not referring to Musk rather the fact that this is tantamount to being a bunch of school hats gossips or cyber bullies  people really need to stop listening to others and start thinking for yourselves.']"

She and her partner both earned good middle class income and they had a daughter without getting married. One day she mentioned that they hadn’t gotten married because in her culture marriage must be a large formal event. They couldn’t just have a small, private ceremony or go to the courthouse, or elope to Vegas like I did. They would have to have a big todo in a church with every possible relative or friend they ever knew or met there. And even for a middle class couple, that meant saving up for a long time.

And a patients ethnicity being part of a diagnostic work up is wildly different than it being the best lens to view a disease which is what was said and what I responded to.   “Joseph Graves Jr, Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona in Phoenix, goes even further, saying that physicians should not use skin colour to diagnose and treat individuals, but only family history. ‘What most people would describe as African American, 80% of that individual’s genes originate somewhere in Africa. But others with the same appearance might have inherited varying amounts of genes from American Indians, Europeans and Africans,’ Graves said. ‘African Americans do have unique health needs,’ he acknowledges, but he also felt that the complex interaction between socioeconomic and environmental conditions contributed more than genetics. For instance, 90% of Africans in Nigeria have the 235T mutation in the ACE gene locus—a marker for hypertension—but only 10% actually have hypertension. Compare that with 85% of African Americans with the mutation, and over 30% who have the disease,”  If you’re actually interested in the subject and not just arguing your point, I’d recommend the below article on the subject.

I am actually mesmerized by the African-American slavery experience, and the History of the USA. I just can\'t stop reading and researching it.   My great-grandaparents on my mother\'s side were African slaves brought to Cuba. My maternal-grandmother could speak YOURUBA. My mother could understand it, but not speak it. I can do neither. But, the differences between a black Cuban, and a black American are really startling. I was very taken aback when I realized Black Americans did not play African drums. Later I learned they actually can\'t. Neither do they believe in African deities. It stroke me as weird, until I researched the true reason. Their History has been erased.   Black Americans are the only blacks in the world who can\'t play African drums, and don\'t believe in SANTERIA. Every single African group in the world will do these two things. And also, not ONE black American I have spoken to knows which part of Africa they descend from. They just don\'t know. Their entire History has been erased. I\'ve even have met African-Americans who do not actually know where Africa is. And to me that is simply ABHORRENT. But, that\'s the way it is.   On my father\'s side my Black African great-grandmother married a white Spaniard. She was brought in to Cuba as a slave. But this Spaniard guy fell in love with her. And he purchased her freedom so they could be married. Tha Law did not allow for a free individual to marry a slave. They could either be both slaves, or both free. And they finally married. Neither of them was lynched. An scenario like that was absolutely impossible in America until 1957 with Loving vs. Virginia. And then I learnt about Emmitt Till. I couldn\'t believe it. American slavery of blacks was so unique in so many aspects. And much of the ostracism of blacks still remain in place.  America\'s RACISM is baked into the American society. You just can\'t escape it.   I could not understand REDLINING, so I bought a book ***""The Color of Law"".  The forgotten History of how our Government Segregated America.*** I could not believe it.

Lastly they never presented a comprehensive model that has higher predictive power than the ones in circulation today. While they often are starting issues with modeling as a whole or older issues we have worked past they fail to then quantify and qualify their implications to the models at play already. Also the IPCC is a report not a model so it's not the strongest form of evidence."", 'Basically, humans are dipping into fossil fuel reserves locked up underground by natural geologic processes of the carbon cycle and releasing carbon dioxide into the air. Carbon dioxide is a gas that traps heat (which is a greenhouse gas), so the more of it there is in the atmosphere, the warmer it gets. We keep on adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, so we are continuing to cause warming. However, it isn’t as simple as adding carbon dioxide directly increases warming. The addition of carbon dioxide and subsequent warming causes instabilities in other parts of the earth system, for example the salt concentration of ocean water. The warming causes melting of ice caps, which lessen the saltiness of sea water and disrupt ocean currents. As I mentioned before, the disruption of the Gulf Stream by the melting of Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice cap could disrupt the flow of the Gulf Stream to Europe, thereby plunging Europe into freezing temperatures as it is in a high latitude and is only kept mild by the warm Gulf Stream current. This is just one example, and the gist of it is that the addition of co2 to the atmosphere will cause a chain reaction of climate effects that will be entirely unpredictable. The only thing we can predict is the increase in atmospheric co2 concentrations, which will inevitably destabilize the climate. And the natural climate cycles never happen this quickly. Sure, we have the odd volcanic eruption that results in cooling, or increased solar activity that results in a little bit of warming, but we have seen an unprecedented increase in warming over the last 100 years, which directly correlates to the addition of co2 to the atmosphere by humans. Natural cycles do not cause change on such short scales, the processes that change the temperature/climate of earth either release co2 into the atmosphere (weathering of rock), or affect earths orbit/position (milankovitch cycles) operate on 1,000s to 100,000s of years. Meanwhile, this change has been occurring over little more than a century and directly parallels human consumption of fossil fuels, and is rising exponentially instead of at a steady rate. By the way, I learned a lot of this in my environmental science class but also through research.']"

What I found jn both instances was that cash became a very powerful tool for buying big ticket items, even if you aren’t spending as much on those items.  It’s the expansion of your own debt that you need to watch in good economic times, and especially when times are uncertain.  It became very hard to in 2009 and for a few years after, even, as lending standards tightened up.    I expect that the GFC was an extreme outlier in its severity, but I also know that the “recession” of 2020 was not nearly as significant as it might have been.  I understand that the recession of 1980-1981 was quite significant as well, and I recall my parents tightening up their spending a lot, though I was just then school age.  That’s more what I expect this go ‘round.  Lending on big ticket purchases will be very difficult, think homes and cars, and the unemployment number might be quite elevated, 6-8%.  Could be worse than that, but I believe a demographic shift has occurred the past 2-4 years, with much of the older workforce stepping away for what they hope is forever.    For investors, being ready to deploy capital will be imperative.  For those of us “little people”, we need to have 3-6 months of our bills saved up in liquid cash.  If one’s job and income holds steady throughout, yeah, great opportunity to perhaps score a home or a used auto for what will seem like a “deal” compared to the inflation in everything these past couple years.', "" Right off the bat, I would like to point out that the effect of interest rates on the marginal propensity to save and invest is much harder to deduce empirically than the macroeconomic wisdom would suggest. Additionally, since the majority of Bank lending is against real estate, most of the action has to take place through the so-called wealth effect. Again, it's tough to show a strong empirical relationship here.  Additionally, while raising interest may slow Bank lending to some degree, it increases government deficit spending. If government deficit spending increases more than the decrease in private credit creation, then the policy ends up being inflationary rather than deflationary. The bigger the government deficit, the truer this is. And I don't think I have to tell you that government deficits have been pretty high in recent history.  But okay, let's assume there IS a deflationary impact from raising interest rates. Let's assume that Banks start lending less to businesses, and consumers start taking on less debt (which is directly contrary to the recent evidence that shows an INCREASE, not a decrease, in private sector debt, but w/e). How is this supposed to help the economically precarious who are living paycheck to paycheck? They have little to no savings, so the incentives to save vs invest mean very little. Meanwhile, decreased investment and demand means higher unemployment. Even if we manage to get prices under control, it comes at the expense of the material well-being of all the newly unemployed people. People with good job security might benefit from this, but the most disposable and economically precarious workers will be hurt the most. So this ends up being a pretty regressive policy.  You can see this even more clearly when you look at who hire interest rates benefit, i.e., savers. Raising interest rates is a policy choice to give people with money free interest income from Treasury securities. It clearly benefits the most those with the most money to save. In a relatively unequal society like ours, where the wealth is already flowing increasingly to a smaller and smaller number of people at the very top, why would we want such a regressive policy?  If inflation is the problem, interest rates are not the answer. First, because interest rate policy is clearly just not super effective at controlling inflation. Second, it is a regressive policy that prioritizes the wealth of the already well off over the material well-being of the worst off.  To the extent that inflation is a problem, the solution is not monetary but fiscal policy. By tightening the fiscal stance in a progressive manner, we can reduce or reverse the growth of the money supply while making sure that it does not come at the cost of the material well-being of the most vulnerable in our society. It may seem difficult or even impossible to find the political will to do this; nonetheless, it is the only real effective solution. Interest rate policy is the fed's hammer, and it will use it whether or not it is truly the right tool for the job. But the true fiscal power lies with Congress.""]"

It takes a whole lot of money to win a land war in asia."", "" I pay attention to what our government spokesmen say and consider the implications.   Disbanding NATO is a little extreme. It's plausible that NATO will become less important over time, because Russia is not a threat. Traditionally the USA was top dog there, because we had the military strength and western europeans believed they could not defend themselves from Russia without us. That belief may be gone now. We'll see.   It sounds like you're unclear on the concept. Generals generally try to be ready to refight the last war. If they lost the last war, they realize they need to do something different. But doing something different costs more than maintaining an existing approach.   Yes, we had no concept how we could create a peace. We never caught up to reality. Our OODA loop was around 6 months, so every 6 months we would notice that our existing approach wasn't working, and we'd announce a new approach which would take 6 months to confirm also didn't work.   But that's military strategy, which is below Congress's pay grade. Congress can mostly increase funding or decrease funding. In recent decades Congress has always increased funding. We can discuss why.    I don't know. I hope we don't.   China is our main excuse to increase military spending. We are in an arms race with them. But if we aren't going to fight them, why would their military spending affect ours?  Maybe we could fight them to defend Taiwan. But China probably won't invade Taiwan. If they do that, they can expect to win a smoking ruin. They do better to get Taiwan to reconcile with them. MAYBE they will attack Taiwan, but I don't think our CIA knows how to make them do that. We were effective at getting Russia to invade Ukraine, but I doubt we could make China invade Taiwan.  Our deep-water Navy is much better than China's and probably will be until there's some big new breakthrough. Aircraft carriers beat battleships, and nothing has beat aircraft carriers yet. Except they are so very expensive and slow to build, so we spend more and more resources defending them instead of attacking with them. Anyway, if the time comes that some new technology makes them fail -- a big swarm of cheap drones, say -- we won't give up on them until at least one of them is sunk or badly damaged, and then we will panic and start crash programs of various sorts.

Jerusalem was cleared of Jews for the first time since Roman times. No Jews were allowed to remain in the West Bank where they had lived for centuries.

The threat of force is barely important for the functioning of all hierarchical societies. You make claims but you don’t defend them and, when you do, you fail.   This is word salad. Also not only do people not have to agree on everything, most of them *are not effected by that thing*.   Whatever you think I said doesn’t change the fact that it isn’t a strawman. It’s rich you think your fucking philosophy is the only kind of philosophy or that philosophy has any relevance to the question of “are you moving goalposts”.   Anarchy as “complete chaos” is actually workable and we can recontextualize “chaos” or “order” in all sorts of ways. Historical anarchists have done so, it isn’t as if “anarchy” didn’t mean “chaos” back then.   Not unless the general orders them to. And, by your logic, the people punching them should be in charge not the general because they’re not using violence at all.  See, there is literally no way you could argue that authority is derived from physical violence. It’s just not how things work.   Stop doing what? The general didn’t order them to punch people. He didn’t do anything at all.   This is nothing than a shoddy attempt at backpedaling. You’re arguing that authority is derived from violence but the authority in your situation hasn’t used violence at all.   If they’re using violence because the general ordered them to, the general hasn’t used violence. If they’re using violence because they love the general so much, *the general still didn’t use violence* (and also didn’t use their authority).  Either way, the general isn’t using violence nor, if the soldiers are going rogue, even commanding violence. Therefore the authority they have cannot be derived from violence.  This is another shitty argument that’s just as bad as the last one. You have a completely dogmatic attachment to the idea that authority = force. It’s fucking insane.   That’s circular logic. Their violence is only possible via equipment but they’re using violence to get that equipment? That doesn’t make sense.  In fact, the idea of a general strike relies on the fact that militaries need social support to exist. Without which they would be incapable of accomplishing anything. And equipment would be produced for the working class not rulers since they’re the ones who actually produce it.  Either way you’re wrong, they *buy* it or pay people to produce it. Literally every government does. That’s how thing actually work. Your ideas don’t resemble how reality actually works. That’s why it’s complete bullshit.   It isn’t. It’s achieved through literal houses of cards. Organizations are structured such that they depend on government for their existence. This leads to compliance with governmental authority and.in turn, obtains compliance elsewhere.   Those higher up in organizations and even those lower down don’t have any major incentive to disobey. For those higher up it’s the opposite. And the dominance of hierarchy everywhere along with its reliance upon government forces people to comply.   Yes they are words. Good job! Now read them.  Justification means “acting without consequence”. Any other meanings are non-material and therefore not necessary.   How old are you? You talk like it’s your first day speaking English.', '   Because, we disagree about the importance of consistency, or at least the importance of that type of consistency - and because I understand that Christian Anarchists don\'t see God that way, which makes them less likely to tie God\'s will to fascist nonsense, regardless of *my* opinion on any possibly extant gods.      I think if people want to be inconsistent with their Anarchism, it\'s fine, *so long as* their inconsistency sides with Anarchism. That is, perhaps it\'s abstractly incorrect (again, a Christian anarchist would not see it this way) for the Christian part of Christian Anarchism to support Anarchism - but as long as Christian Anarchists support Anarchism over Christianity, I don\'t really care if their religious ideals are abstractly contradictory. If instead they were inconsistent *as Anarchists*, I would care - ie, patriarchy based in Christian faith is consistent with some forms of Christianity, but it\'s incompatible with Anarchism, so I care if an Anarchist Christian is patriarchal, because internal inconsistency in one\'s Anarchist principles *is* damaging to Anarchism.         Valid point. I typically speak in an ultimate sense, rather than an immediate one, but yes, in the immediate sense, AnCaps are not our allies, even accidentally. (I have other opinions on this that muddy this a bit, but they\'re not worth going into here.)         I\'ve never met an AnCap in real life, but I\'ve met plenty online, and I can say based on that that many of them are just Market Anarchists confused about what Capitalism is. (Not most, but many. Most are StateCorp boot-lickers, or StateCorp-adjacent.)      Market Anarchism (which I tend to call Market-Socialist Anarchism to remind people that it\'s a form of Socialism, not Capitalism - Market Anarchists tend to be badly misunderstood, even by fellow Anarchists) is a strain of Anarchism which states that markets are a good way of figuring out who wants/needs what, but that Capitalism is not a good market system. There are many strains of Market Anarchism, which arguably includes everything from Mutualism to Left-Rothbardianism, and everything in-between. (Left-Rothbardianism is an oddball ideology, I\'ll admit that much.) Anyhow, Market Anarchism essentially posits that markets (including money) can/should still exist in Anarchism. This basically just means ""Anarchists who are not AnCom."" Individual theories within the tradition have a variety of specific positions, but all are anti-Capitalism.      I personally am a Meta-Anarchist, so I\'d like to see AnCom and various communities with differing social and economic forms emerge within an Anarchist framework. This is because I\'m sure many would enjoy AnCom, but I personally would not - I\'m far too antisocial for an economic arrangement of that nature. At the same time, I don\'t want to take that from people who would enjoy it - therefore, let many forms of Anarchism flourish, and I can live in the one that suits me, and others can live in the ones that suit them.']"
