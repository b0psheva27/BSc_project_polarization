Yes, because they didn't have control of the house at that time, or today.  State governments could increase funding, though it goes against the use your tax dollars how you please mantra of the party.  It's not a hypothetical. How many historical examples can you find of a 3 year old surviving without aid? I'd bet none.  I'm very aware of what the FDA acronym stands for. Yes, there would be lives lost by harmful drugs the FDA didn't get off the market. But it's way less than the amount of lives you would save by not delaying life saving drugs. Take the covid vaccine for example. They had promising results for those in summer of 2020. And even with a record breaking EUA process, the FDA still cost thousands of lives by delaying an incredibly effective vaccine by an additional 7 months.  Early on in the pandemic, there were also several companies that had created rapid tests that met world health organization standards. But because the FDA decided to take their time reviewing them a second time, tests were pretty much non existant outside of hospitals for the first few months of the pandemic, making it extremely difficult to find any outbreak sources before they spiraled out of control.  And no, the efficiency claim is not an option to skirt around the FDA, unless your product didn't need FDA approval in the first place. (ie some vitimins ect). It used to be the case, prior to the 1962 amendments by Kennedy.   A company cannot make any claim in their marketing unless approved by the FDA."", ' Disagree. Governments do what fussiness cannot do without the government. For example, only a government can enforce intellectual property laws. A business could not do this. A business cannot regulate other businesses to decrease competitors is another example.    I’m failing to see what this analogy is for. In Ancapistan, if you kicked my dog, my rights enforcement agency would handle the matter. And I would be the one paying them, so they would have my interest in mind, not yours. In statism, you limit my rights enforcement to one agency that is apparently easily bought off by you. My system seems better.   The ancap criticism of government is not that it does nothing, it is that the government actively does things; things which a private citizen or group of citizens could not do.    Lol. Well you did a really good job of destroying that moronic straw man that you built up there. So you are very smart.', ""They don't want to. In basically all things the republican solution is to punish the little guy.  I've come to think this is a key ideological difference, that most problems can be solved through brutally tearing down the perpetrators of the lowest crimes, societal problems, and perceived undesirables. Whereas democrats tend to favor building up that prevents or mitigates the problem.  * Jail the drug users and keep them out of employment // send them to rehab and alleviate the poverty that drove them to drugs  * Harsher sentences for the thief and make them pay more // alleviate the poverty that drove them to steal  * See that the poor work harder and tell them to be happy with less // raise their wages and protect their labor rights  * Run out the homeless and keep them away from populated spaces // provide free housing and counciling to improve whatever drove them to homelessness  * Bar the immigrant, jail them, separate their family // work to improve the conditions that drove them to overstay their visa, make a path to forgiveness and get them legal  &amp;nbsp;  Similar - republicans tend to blame from the bottom up, while democrats tend to blame from the top down  * It's the drug addict's fault // it's the pharmaceutical companies and poverty  * it's the thief's fault for stealing // it's the poverty and desperation that drove them to steal  * It's the poor's fault for not working hard enough // it's the company's greed and the lack of opportunities  * It's the homeless' fault for not getting their life together // it's the high cost of living and lack of mental healthcare  * It's the immigrant's fault for coming here // it's whatever they're fleeing from that made being a fugitive look better than staying where they are  Also notice that half of those are poverty. People who are secure in their needs don't typically do crack and rob liquor stores.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  EDIT: Okay, I wrote a response to somebody who criticized this saying I'm implying that democrats are just holy people and can't believe I would suggest that nobody should be punished for crime. And the coward deleted their comment before I could finish. So I'm going to edit with this clarification.  &amp;nbsp;  What I mean is that the republicans I know personally often demonstrate similar qualities.  * What is to be done about crime and drugs, and republicans will say - bring back the death penalty, public executions, make prisons more brutal, make sentences longer, forced labor, forced sterilization  * What is to be done about homelessness, and republicans will say - put them in jail, send them somewhere else, forced military service, be cruel to them so they leave, just kill them off  * What is to be done about illegal immigration, and republicans will say - put them in jail, be cruel to them so others are afraid to come here, make it harder to come here legally, forced labor programs, send the military with orders to shoot on sight.  * What is to be done about protests and riots, and republicans will say - brutality so horrible that none will dare protest again (hey it worked in China), use mustard gas, send in the military to kill them all.  The solution is always more brutality, more cruelty, more jail, more death. They're just cruel-minded people who I am certain would celebrate something like the holocaust if it happened today  &amp;nbsp;  Yes, obviously the criminal goes to jail. I'm not saying to just let crime happen, say nice words and hope they change their ways; you smoke crack and rob a liquor store and yeah you're going to jail.  But there are root causes that will not be solved with more brutality.""]"

There are clearly two roles in human reproduction: to make pregnant, and to gestate and birth.   PLers will twist themselves into pretzels trying to explain how women do both. And then try to untwist themselves when it comes to explaining how biology apparently changes in rape.   Once again, all the sex in the world without insemination will NEVER lead to pregnancy.   Insemination without sex can any will lead to pregnancy.   I’m not sure why that’s so hard to understand - short of it not fitting the „the woman is at fault for everything“ narrative.   This absurd refusal to hold a man responsible for his actions and his part in it is even more ridiculous coming from PLers. Since they have no problem holding the woman „personally“ responsible for the man’s actions.   People don’t get shot if there’s no live bullets being fired into or at their bodies. And only the person firing them is responsible for such. Unless you’re claiming a man didn’t have full agency over his body, actions, and choices.  I’ve been having sex for over 30 years with no chance of pregnancy. Men with vasectomies and regular sperm count are firing blanks. They can’t make pregnant.', ' All women are marginalized in a forced birth society, and women who would have been alive aside from abortion bans are killed BY YOU.  Just because sometimes people die naturally does not make killing women okay. Would you accept it if I told you that abortion is perfectly fine because sometimes fetuses die?   FORCED pregnancy is not okay.   FORCED pregnancy is not okay. FORCED pregnancy is rape. You seek to rape and kill women through FORCED pregnancy.   Some people may have a heart attack naturally but it\'s not okay to deliberately give someone a heart attack.  Some people may die naturally but it\'s not okay to kill them.  Some women die in childbirth but it\'s not okay to kill women in childbirth.   Sure: [https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/oct/severe-maternal-morbidity-united-states-primer](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/severematernalmorbidity.html)  *""While maternal deaths in the United States number about 650 to 750 annually, severe maternal morbidity affects approximately 50,000 to 60,000 women each year, and the numbers are increasing.""*   So you think it\'s okay to visit any level of violence on a woman as long as it doesn\'t kill us. Do you beat your wife to a pulp every night? Do you go around raping every woman you see? Why not? it\'s not killing us. Praise modern medicine! Amirite?   ANd when you FORCE a woman to stay pregnant and give birth, she is neither choosing to stay pregnant or accepting that risk. If she dies, YOU KILLED HER.   And you\'re perfectly fine with killing us in forced childbirth. You are pro-killing-women. Just say it. Just say that you want us dead.   It is if you\'re KILLING SOMEONE THROUGH FORCED BIRTH. If they could have gotten an abortion and didn\'t because of PL laws, PLERS KILLED HER. YOU KILLED HER.  Admit you\'re in favor of women dying to ""save babies."" Just say it. Say you\'re not in favor of protecting ALL life because you want women dead.   Allowing abortions allows women to get abortions and avoid childbirth. Abortion is far far safer than childbirth, and allowing every woman who wants an abortion to get one ensures that nobody is FORCED to risk death.   You don\'t, because they don\'t work. Women still die and you are fine with it. You say ""some women die, and it\'s tragic,"" and shrug and walk away. You rationalize it by saying it\'s perfectly fine to visit any level of violence on a woman you want--you may rape us, beat us, maim us, brutalize us--as long as you don\'t *kill* us. PRAISE MODERN MEDICINE. Amirite?   YOU ARE MURDEROUS. You want to hurt women, you want to commit violence against women, and you want to kill women. Just admit it. Just say that ""life exceptions"" means putting women in the ground, and you are fine with that. Just say that you are happy to visit ANY level of violence against a woman as long as it doesn\'t kill us, but also you\'re perfectly fine with killing us.  ""Women just die,"" you say. ""Our deaths are tragic but THINK OF THE BABIES,"" you say. ""I\'m fine with you dying,"" you say. Just admit it. Just own it. You\'re just as much of a murderer as you think I am.   More so, since killing women is killing actual PEOPLE, whereas killing a fetus is just killing a clot of tissue.', "" There is literally zero guilt here.  I'm not only pro choice I'm actively pro abortion.  It is a fantastic medical procedure that is a great thing to be available to a society.  Being pregnant and giving birth even if you plan to give it up for adoption is a life changing and stressful thing not to mention it can wreck your body.  Abortions have also prevented millions of kids being born into absolute terrible situations with basically zero chance of growing up normal and living a normal life.  If the adoption system in America and foster homes in this country weren't a giant cluster fuck I might lean a little more towards giving up for an adoption.  Not to mention lots of people get pregnant at a point in their life where having and raising a kid is not really an option.  Abortions have helped millions of people.  Again, a clump of cells that relies on being connected to a human to survive is not a person and is not alive.  You nut jobs can are somehow unable to understand this.  Let's assume they are, though. You have no thoughts or recollection of any of that.  It's really not a life.  If someone aborted me at 7 months I'd never have even realized it.  Also, assume abortion was made federally illegal.  What's your grand plan for all of these millions of kids born into terrible situations or given up for adoption?  You realize most people getting abortions aren't soccer moms that live in the suburbs, right?  They are poor people or people in bad situations that realize they are not in a situation to raise a child.  So you think the best option is basically force millions of people into a poor life of struggling and suffering vs aborting something that has no memory, thoughts, and will never even know they were going to exist and is the best option for all parties involved?  Get the fuck out of here with that ridiculousness.  If you don't agree with abortion then that's perfectly OK. Don't facilitate one or be with someone that approves of them.  But stay the fuck out of everyone else's life and ability to make this decision for themselves because in your opinion it's wrong.  You're more than likely some religious nut which really would explain a lot.""]"

You’re just saying gun control talking points without making any real counters. Yes brazil is a very poor country but what does overall wealth of the country have to do with the effects of guns in the country ? Those are totally different statistics.   I already addressed the car license thing but you obviously either didn’t read what I said or are choosing to ignore it. You also don’t have to prove you’re not crazy before buying an 800 hp dodge demon and driving down the road with it.   Attacking mental health should be priority because it’s the root of the problem. If you fix the root of the problem there’s a high probability that you wouldn’t have to take gun rights away.   The idea of FREEDOM I CAN OWN WHAT I WANT has nothing to do with the point I’m making about semi automatics that you’re also not addressing.   You act like other countries around the world all live in total harmony with no one being victimized. In a lot of these countries you can’t even defend yourself without being put on trial for murder because they don’t even let you defend yourself. Canada had hardly any violence in the first place and they started with “common sense gun laws” and now they’re pretty much banning all guns in canada lol. You also act like everyone in those countries agree with those laws which they don’t.   Weve had “military style weapons” for over a hundred years.  Gun ownership in America has risen drastically and overall violence has dropped drastically over the years. You’re just really not addressing any points I’m making here.   What do you propose is going to solve this problem ? Mental health checks and banning all semi automatic weapons ? Because it goes from “common sense” to banning almost everything pretty fast.  This is an issue where people advocating for gun laws know nothing about firearms and that’s clearly the case here with you. You should learn about something you’re advocating for before forming an opinion imo. Learn about the way firearms work and you’ll quickly figure out how this plays out. You either ban almost everything or nothing at all. There really is no inbetween.', 'A shotgun can hold 8 or more shells at a time. So if someone walks into a school and shoots 8 kids with a shotgun, which is wayyyy deadlier than an ar15 round for round, we’re just gonna say it’s fine for shotguns to still be legal because it’s only 8 kids instead of more? That’s not how it works. Shotguns will be next and then it’ll all be illegal. Look at canada.    A car you need nothing to buy one. To drive on the road you need that stuff. I already said that. And that’s how guns are also regulated in most states. You need a permit to carry concealed in public.   “Prove you’re not a criminal and mentally competent” to prove I’m not a criminal all I need is a background check ,which is already a federal law and to prove someone is mentally competent how is that done? I already asked you how should that be accomplished ? You don’t just sit down with a therapist for an hour and they’ll know that you’re not a psychopath. This needs to be a thing way before the purchase of a firearm, sooooo mental health support from a young age ….   That was canadas murder rate before they literally banned all firearms. That’s my whole point. You’re saying to just put in place common sense laws and it’ll end there but it doesn’t end there they keep pushing for more until all firearms are banned and now we get to the true belief that you’re ok with all firearms being banned eventually. So this idea of “we only want common sense gun laws” is bs.  I live in California and it started with “common sense gun law” and now we have laws that literally make 0 sense and everyone with 2 brain cells think they’re stupid. Even anti gun people think they’re stupid.  They tried to basically ban permitted concealed carry when concealed carriers have never been linked to any type of gun violence. It’s nonsense. They put a funny looking grip on an ar15 and say they banned assault weapons. It’s literally the most uncommon sense ever  If someone came up with something competent I’d be the first person to give them credit', 'So 6 states out of 50 have lower gun deaths based on their gun laws but the other 44 states are all over the spectrum all with loose gun laws. And California, Massachusetts, Hawaii, and New York off the top of my head are all really nice states to live and have a ton of funding from tourism. So what I’m trying to say is I think those states would probably have low crime either way. But there’s other states that have loose gun laws that also have low gun deaths too … so I don’t see it.']

He called himself ""chief of sinners"" because of the time he spent hunting and murdering Christians.  The problem is that twisting scripture in small ways can lead to disastrous outcomes. This exact thing has happened with many scriptures. Where this conversation was going was ""well we\'re all sinners so does [this] sin even matter?"" Views that make light of sin always lead to sin .It\'s been the same discussion for almost 2 thousand years now. ""Well wouldn\'t more sin mean more grace?"" Paul responds to this in Romans 6.  What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 2 By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 3 Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.  Notice the exclamation mark after by no means. It\'s not very common in scripture. The words are very strong in the greek.   Anyone who would wish to be a Christian must understand the danger of sin and choose a life of fighting to be free of it by the spirit. Scripture tells us that those who take sin lightly either don\'t understand the high price that was paid for redemption or don\'t appreciate it anyway (hebrews 10:29) and will lose the grace given to them. Christ paid a high price with his own blood and suffering. The word excruciating was created to describe the unimaginable pain of literally tearing your body apart as you fight to take a breath (the cross actually kills by asphyxiation). He gave everything to put an end to sin. He expects people to respect the gravity of the situation   But yes all sin can be redeemed but twisting scripture to make certain sins look less dangerous only leads to dangerous places.

It does provide a lot of up-to-date information, but that same information can be spread through (and here I\'m giving more sensible answers than IRC lol) the news, radio, local twitter-like websites, facebook, etc.  Disasters happened before twitter, and things were fine.  What twitter added was millions of morons adding their own opinions and misinformation to the mix.  Sometimes they may say true things.  But the ""boston bomber"" affair wasn\'t a reddit only thing.

Fewer locations to access low cost or free care leads to higher mortality.  Bonus secondary explanation: the less education you have the more likely you are to be conservative and vice versa. The less educated you are the less money, on average, you make in a year. Therefore the less you make the more likely you are, on average, to be conservative.

Edit: spelling', ""My favorite explanation, by Rothbard, has it going back earlier still. That what began as a liberal revolution in the 18 th century, they made unprecedented gains in overthrowing monarchy globally, soon shifted to a rearguard action where they began defending what they had gained rather than pushing forward with further gains.  A radical creed became in this way a conservative defensive, over time. The liberals of that day abandoned radicalism, thinking that society would evolve naturally over the next eons towards liberty, under the cultural influence of darwinism.  He specifically singles out Herbert Spencer as emblematic of this ideological shift.  But I think the problem of that day was primarily a deficit in theory. They did not have adequate theory to understand how to apply the principle of liberty any further than they had achieved.  The old regime was overthrown because they knew very well what they were against, but they did not know well what kind and shape of society could be built that was in line with the philosophy of liberty.  Only with the resurgence of liberty ideology after WW2 with Rothbard, Friedman, and Mises do we get a resurgence of theory such as arguably hadn't been occurring for a few decades, or with only a few figures.  During that time, the mantle of the radical opposition group was taken up by the Marxists, who are unfortunately a false revolution.  And I would say that's the main reason why we have trouble getting off the ground currently, people who recognize there's something wrong with the system are too often being driven towards Marxism as the solution, whereas they used to be driven into classical liberalism ideas.  For a resurgence of liberty philosophy, it may be necessary for socialism to first die or be rejected as a liberal creed.  But that's not happening, and in fact it grows like some kind of virus. Because it feeds on the wrongs of the current system.""]"

If one doesn't consider the project already failed and more or less ceded to the Russian Federation.   Most of the communists, those of a more international position, who were associated with the projects of Lugansk and Donetsk republics have fled, hid or died in various assassinations and artillery shellings. The communists were seen as the larger threat, as they specifically addressed ethnic Ukrainians in the Ukrainian language in their propaganda. They were primary targets of the post-coup Ukrainian government. For them, Donetsk and Lugansk were supposed to be successors of a legitimate Ukrainian SR, that could potentially grow if more people rebelled against the coup. The Dugin-influenced patsoc's are more friendly to the Russian Federation. Safety for ethnic Russians, rather than socialism, is the core of their position, so they get better protection from Russia. They have become the primary political force in the separatist regions.   While these ethnically Russian Patsoc's are obviously quite wrong, and dangerous to minorities in Russia, they did not spring from nowhere. There are tens of thousands of stateless ethnic Russians who were denied citizenship and rights in various post-soviet states, including Ukraine, and lacked the means to go somewhere else at their own expense, as was demanded by the new states. While there is plenty to be said for Russian imperialism before the revolution and their status as a dominant or preferred ethnicity in conquered territory, and for chauvinist attitudes in later years, that is not the universal experience. It also doesn't help that they adopt a nostalgia for the Soviet Union and its imagery, but without socialist politics, which is shallow and deceptive.   At best, one could argue that they make the necessary compromises to mobilize ethnic Russians against western capitalist influence. At worst, and I'm quite pessimistic, they belong to capitalists more fully than they admit and lack revolutionary potential on the basis of that ethnocentrism. But I can acknowledge people who hold the former view as comrades even if I don't do the same with regards to the governments and organizations in question."", ""You'll appreciate these:  A cyber cat-and-mouse game ensued, with the United States, Britain and other allies helping to shore up Ukrainian computers and stave off Russian intrusions.  On Feb. 23, hours before the invasion began, Sandworm took another swing, launching malware that infected several hundred Ukrainian government computers, officials said. The intrusion was detected quickly, the damage contained.  Then Sandworm struck again. But the code it used looked like it had been thrown together at the last minute, with programming errors — another fail.  Sandworm wasn’t done. In its boldest stroke yet, it went after the Ukrainian military’s satellite communications, used by soldiers in the field. It worked, and by 6:15 a.m. on Feb. 24, the system went down, right at Ukraine’s most vulnerable moment.  It could have been a crippling blow. But the Ukrainian government had a backup plan: a separate satellite communications system, which it had tested only two months before, to make sure it was ready in the event of a Russian invasion.    ...  Ukrainian law enforcement officials started noticing something else suspicious as well: a spike in foreign cellphone numbers near the border, in the forests between Ukraine and Belarus.  Russian soldiers were using cellphones to call home, and suddenly popping up on Ukrainian networks. Officials who monitor the traffic during peacetime for criminal activity quickly realized they could see and hear the invaders approaching in real time.  “We listened to the Russian soldiers as they panicked and called their friends and relatives,” said an official who oversees the phone intercepts. “They used ordinary phones to make decisions about their further moves.”  Down long corridors guarded by locks with facial detection, behind doors sealed with wax to detect intruders, teams of women tracked the Russian troops from small listening booths while their friends and relatives grabbed rifles to patrol the streets.  “We understood where the enemy was, what numbers they were using,” the official said.  The eavesdroppers passed the details to Ukraine’s armed forces to carry out ambushes and counterattacks. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, said Ukrainian forces used cellphone signals and even TikTok videos to target a unit of Chechen soldiers known as the Kadyrovtsy, named for the strongman leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.  It took 40 minutes from the time one video was uploaded to pinpoint the unit’s location near the Hostomel airport northwest of Kyiv, Mr. Budanov said. The Ukrainian military then hit them with three Tochka-U ballistic missiles, he said.  The Russians kept closing in on Kyiv, forcing the eavesdroppers tucked in listening rooms to make a quick decision: destroy their equipment and flee for their own safety, or hang on and continue gathering intelligence.  They stayed.  “We didn’t lose Ukraine. We didn’t let the enemy move further,” the official said. “On the first days, when they made foolish mistakes, we used their foolish mistakes to our advantage.”"", 'If El Paso had been embroiled in a separatist movement for 8 years yeah I really wouldn\'t have a problem with it, especially if not allowing El Paso to be independent meant the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives, massive damage to US infrastructure, and a decades spanning crippled economy. The Donbas and Eastern Ukraine has always been a contested area, even in the original elections those areas went to Ukraine by margins so narrow that in the US we would have held special elections for in many areas. Let\'s not pretend that these areas were the same as the rest of Ukraine, that Putin ever voiced interest in any area outside of these hotly contested areas, or that the people in these areas don\'t blame Ukraine for the war and not the Russians. You don\'t even have to read Russian sources, the financial times conducted interviews in Bakhmut and even the Ukrainian military in the area said that was a common sentiment in the area.   Let\'s also not forget that Zelensky ran on a platform of making peace with the Russians and ran on that platform but proceeded to do the opposite due to pressure from the West.   For the record I don\'t believe NATO troops are in Ukraine or that Ukraine is full of Nazis, I do believe that these areas of Ukraine have wanted independence for a long time, have fought for this independence for a long time, and that Ukraine doesn\'t really care all that much about these areas since they conducted shelling operations in these areas the day before the Russian invasion in violation of the Minsk accords. About dictators today that we support, Egypt? Saudi Arabia? Alegeria? Afghanistan (hardly a democracy, run by a warlord before that fell apart)? There are quite a few oppressive regimes and dictatorships we fund.  As for the Belt and Road initiative, how exactly is increasing a military budget going to help solve that? Are we going to start bombing countries for having Chinese funded infrastructure projects? It\'s not as though the Chinese government is sending its military to these places, they are using money and deals to gain and exercise power, and that\'s not something we can stop with guns and missiles. We can\'t just send soldiers to a country\'s port and say ""we own this now"", we\'d look like thugs because that\'s exactly what we would be.   Yes Russia is making friends in Iran and Syria. What the hell else do you expect them to do? We have cut them off from the rest of the world. We create enemies with our attempts at ""spreading democracy"" which is just code for ""we just want people in charge who we are friends with"" then cry and panic when it fails and other countries who we don\'t like make friends with the countries we made enemies out of. There is a reason why the Iranians don\'t like us and that\'s because we did a regime change in the 40\'s, the Syrians don\'t like us for the same reason.   Yes, as a NYC resident and native I\'m well aware of 9/11, but had our government exercised any competency it never would have happened, it was a preventable tragedy. All the whole war on terror, aka America\'s pissing contest with Islamofascists, did was make more people side with the Islamofascists because when your family is killed in a drone attack you lose all sympathy you may have had for some Americans that died in the WTC. Also, who was supporting the Taliban, Al-Queda, ISIS, and all these other groups before they attacked the US???? The US. WE CREATE OUR OWN PROBLEMS. The interventionism inevitably fails because we back losing causes, we increase resentment towards us, and our takeaway is that next time we should intervene harder. We are chasing the illusion that every country we dislike is like Nazi Germany and that if we win we can create a functional liberal democracy like we did there.   I think you overestimate Ukraine and misunderstand the Russian strategy, blitzing quickly may have been the original strategy but ever since April the new strategy has been the war of attrition, camp the positions, abandon areas that aren\'t defendable, and wait out Ukraine and it\'s working. Ukraine is running out of weapons, the new ones they are getting although more advanced cannot be maintained in the Ukraine and have to be sent to Germany for repairs (as the people who know how to fix them cannot be in Ukraine as the Russians would treat it as an act of war) and this will only further stress the already overworked supply lines into Ukraine. 100 billion dollars spent and can we really say that they caused 100 billion in damages to the Russian military or prevented 100 Billion dollars in damages to their own country? Most of Ukraine\'s energy grid is in the crapper, most are on the brink of starving or freezing this winter, is this what victory looks like? Was all this worth it?   I also think you overestimate effect of sanctions on Russia and underestimate the undeniably worse effect they have had on the West. Europe is going through an energy crisis, fertilizer increased in cost substantially, there are food shortages across the world. We have also permanently ensured that Russia will never rejoin the global financial system no matter who is in power because of the animosity we created by ceasing the assets of Russian civilians abroad. Now Russia and china are creating their own financial system which they will use with their new friends in the middle east to trade oil, which is a massive blow to the dollar.   I love America, I love the country, I love it\'s people, I love the constitution. What I don\'t love is our insane approach to foreign policy and our indifference towards the horrors of the wars we cause and escalate.

A lot of stats suggest the change *increased* the number of students from lower income backgrounds who go to university (maybe because there are more maintenance grants for living costs for people on low incomes being funded by the new tuition fees), or at least, the number has increased regardless of that change. Also, like, it's theoretically always affordable, and it's important to understand how the system works, it's arguably pretty fair. You do take out a loan of around £9000 a year to pay for your course, but interest is taken as a percentage of income above about £27k a year, like a tax, after your graduate, and if in 30 years you haven't paid it off the rest is cancelled. So theoretically if someone leaves university and can't make much money they won't pay much at all, while the service is subsidised by high earners who got high-paying work from their degrees. Arguably it's a fairer system than funding from the taxpayer, if more complex.  At the end of the day, people who go to university on average will still make more over a lifetime than people who don't, including tuition fees and the years of lost work. I think the system as it is works fine to be honest, even if it is a bit bureaucratic and does ultimately saddle people with debt (that, at the same time, is not that bad as debt goes).""]"

If you cannot see the inherent bias in your media and the flaws in your leaders as well as the positives in the opposition then its safe to say you\'ve been compromised and your being influenced, if not outright manipulated. Again this is true for most people regardless of their political leanings.   The reason why this is so Cleary the case with Musk is because most people give the see vague reasons why they dislike him.  Truth is he\'s bizzare because he\'s a very unique individual,  a one off,.he\'s highly intelligent in certain areas but lacks social intelligence.  This is actually extremely common for people like him.  People  talk crap about him being some elitist billionaire or being a narcissist or megalomaniac. He\'s none of those things.... well he is definitely a billionaire but other than his jet which honestly is a necessity when you are a CEO of a larğge and rapidly expanding international company.  But other than that he\'s not ai typical of some elitist D-bag billionaire.   Musk has enough money for neither him or his family to ever need to work again. I seriously mean never. Not his kids ,grandkids, great grand  kids etc. Yet all he does is work . For a while he had a tiny home  that he\'d stay in at the space X launch pad but I\'ve heard many talk about him often sleeping on the factory floor so he can keep getting things done if it calls for it.  He\'s singlehandedly responsible for the wide adoption of Evs. Because the innovations they\'ve made have  lowers  costs significantly.  They make great products that people enjoy and that will last a long time. Not only that but each of their products has the potential to make its owner money. But they have to make great products because they have no marketing department. When\'s the last time you\'ve seen a Tesla add or dealership? They don\'t have them which is friggin insane, completely unheard of for any large corporate producer of any product. This is why a socially awkward Musk is always stirring things up and causing a buzz with his tweets.Henis Teslas marketing department. That fact alone saves the company 100s of millions as year.  There\'s also the fact that once you understand his vision and how all of the products all of his companies are meant to be integrated. His vision of the future is a good one too. While billionaires like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates claim to be about the environment ,in reality that aren\'t. Instead they are about control.  All their ideas involve more regulations, less freedom for us,and more control for them. You\'ve got Gates preaching deportation and trying to get everyone to leave rural areas cand consolidate into major cities. Conveniently this will make people easier to control. But while he preaches that he\'s busy buying up as much farmland as he cN get his hands on. Gates is now the largest owner of farms in the country. This is a very bad thing. I mean it\'s already bad enough that the vast majority of all products at the grocery store are owned by only a handful  of companies. Imagine if only a handful grow all the food. Talk about power.1😬 Swab is preaching the great reset saying ""you\'ll own nothing but be happy "" All of their visions for our future are ones where all of us have to be OK with having significantly less while they get more. Musk on the other hand has a vision where things in the future are more decentralized so they give power to each individual rather than for him and his billionaire buddies Ike Gates and Schwab want.  Musk doesn\'t care about money or power. His motivation is one of impact. He wants to change the world in a significantly meaningful way. Sure you could  say that alone is selfish because he could be motivated by wanting ro be remembered and leaving  a legacy, but who doesn\'t want that?  All I want to know is where we\'re you guys when Twitter and FB were deliberately censoring or silencing people in order to manipulate people into voting for the candidates they back. This means that liberals were obviously the ones who were indoctrinated. That doesn\'t make you mad? Musk just released a ton of files show the blatant corruption and collision between liberal politicians and social media.  Coincidentally it was after he did this that they began attacking Musk hardcore. And all of you are now doing their bidding.  It\'s crazy. Why are all of you so obsessed with Musk...wait until he gets things dialed and reveals the real reason why he bought Twitter.....it\'s friggin genius and will benefit all of us greatly.  Yet you guys run around parroting concerns and hating on someone you don\'t even know and whose actions do no harm to you whatsoever. Hate all you want, it\'s what unsuccessful people do.

To me, the answer is clear, but I want to hear what you have to say."", 'But the entire point of the patriarchy and the inequality between men and women is that women have never defined what ""femininity"" meant, let alone masculinity. It has always been powerful men within the systems of control that have done that.  The toxic element is where masculinity is taken to a point that harms men and harms the people around them that is often signal boosted by the cultural systems in play. There just isn\'t really a straight up equivalent for women. There\'s internalized misogyny where women do harmful things because of patriarchal systems, but there\'s no matriarchal systems that push women into harmful thoughts and actions.  It\'d be like trying to say systematic racism in the US needs an equivalent for minorities. Well, the systems in place just never existed where minorities could define racism and enforce their will on others. Are some minority individuals self-hating, perpetuating racism for power or money, straight up mean spirited or cruel? Sure, there\'s internalized racism, but there isn\'t quite the same concept as systematic racism.  I get why men might feel upset (I am a man myself) but it\'s about understanding gender expectations and roles that are often forced onto men and some men live out, not that men are intrinsically bad.', 'I never said I blame an entire gender for all of human suffering 💀 Please show me where you got that quote  Wtf do you think ""patriarchy"" means? A conspiracy theory YOU believe in? It means men are responsible for all of human suffering. In short, if women suffer = patriarchy. If men suffer however = also patriarchy.  ""On the other hand, in healthcare, women are more likely to be taken less seriously by healthcare workers, even if the nurse or doctor is also a woman""  Yeah feminists love to say this but there\'s no real evidence for it once you account for the fact that women are much more likely to complain and exaggerate their supposed ""suffering"". If it was truly an issue then women would have worse survival/recovery rates than men but they don\'t. There is no ""upper hand"" for men. It\'s just a classic example of a gender disparity and women immediately assuming ""misogyny"" is the reason.  If anything, doctors are LESS likely to feel sympathetic towards male patients.  ""The most well known if it’s downfall is women finally getting the right to vote, for example.""  Men got the vote a meager TEN freaking years before all women got the vote. The idea that this proves ""men had more say throughout history"" is highly asinine.  At the end of the day, men have less rights than women. They get less programs on their behalf. Basically every single institution, particularly academia, education, politics &amp; the media HEAVILY caters towards women, men do not get the same legal protections as women (men cannot be raped by women under federal law, men are more likely to be arrested for reporting their OWN domestic violence victimization at the hands of women due to the Duluth Model, which was implemented by feminists, etc etc).  By any ""systemic"" measurment, men have it a LOT worse. But despite all of that, people IN GENERAL have it very good now. I like to think that neither gender should complain about being ""oppressed"". However, I\'m sick of seeing women play the victim when objectively they have it ""even better"" than men.']"

I am not a woman and I suspect you are not as well. But I do know that people make decisions based on a multitude of factors and it’s overly presumptive of either of us to conclude that one factor weighed more heavily in the decision to have a child. One factor that I had never considered was cultural norms around weddings in the south. I had an African American coworker whose family came from the south. She and her partner both earned good middle class income and they had a daughter without getting married. One day she mentioned that they hadn’t gotten married because in her culture marriage must be a large formal event. They couldn’t just have a small, private ceremony or go to the courthouse, or elope to Vegas like I did. They would have to have a big todo in a church with every possible relative or friend they ever knew or met there. And even for a middle class couple, that meant saving up for a long time. And it should go without saying that African American don’t have the kind of generational wealth where the parents of the bride and groom can just pick up the tab. When I’ve gone to any kind of fancy wedding, that’s usually the arrangement.', '…d you not know the difference in race and ethnicity?  In all the cases you mentioned, you are mostly confusing race and ethnicity which are completely different.   And a patients ethnicity being part of a diagnostic work up is wildly different than it being the best lens to view a disease which is what was said and what I responded to.   “Joseph Graves Jr, Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona in Phoenix, goes even further, saying that physicians should not use skin colour to diagnose and treat individuals, but only family history. ‘What most people would describe as African American, 80% of that individual’s genes originate somewhere in Africa. But others with the same appearance might have inherited varying amounts of genes from American Indians, Europeans and Africans,’ Graves said. ‘African Americans do have unique health needs,’ he acknowledges, but he also felt that the complex interaction between socioeconomic and environmental conditions contributed more than genetics. For instance, 90% of Africans in Nigeria have the 235T mutation in the ACE gene locus—a marker for hypertension—but only 10% actually have hypertension. Compare that with 85% of African Americans with the mutation, and over 30% who have the disease,”  If you’re actually interested in the subject and not just arguing your point, I’d recommend the below article on the subject. Lots of physicians are researching this and not because of liberals pushing their agendas.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1084221/', 'Thank you. I will. I am actually mesmerized by the African-American slavery experience, and the History of the USA. I just can\'t stop reading and researching it.   My great-grandaparents on my mother\'s side were African slaves brought to Cuba. My maternal-grandmother could speak YOURUBA. My mother could understand it, but not speak it. I can do neither. But, the differences between a black Cuban, and a black American are really startling. I was very taken aback when I realized Black Americans did not play African drums. Later I learned they actually can\'t. Neither do they believe in African deities. It stroke me as weird, until I researched the true reason. Their History has been erased.   Black Americans are the only blacks in the world who can\'t play African drums, and don\'t believe in SANTERIA. Every single African group in the world will do these two things. And also, not ONE black American I have spoken to knows which part of Africa they descend from. They just don\'t know. Their entire History has been erased. I\'ve even have met African-Americans who do not actually know where Africa is. And to me that is simply ABHORRENT. But, that\'s the way it is.   On my father\'s side my Black African great-grandmother married a white Spaniard. She was brought in to Cuba as a slave. But this Spaniard guy fell in love with her. And he purchased her freedom so they could be married. Tha Law did not allow for a free individual to marry a slave. They could either be both slaves, or both free. And they finally married. Neither of them was lynched. An scenario like that was absolutely impossible in America until 1957 with Loving vs. Virginia. And then I learnt about Emmitt Till. I couldn\'t believe it. American slavery of blacks was so unique in so many aspects. And much of the ostracism of blacks still remain in place.  America\'s RACISM is baked into the American society. You just can\'t escape it.   I could not understand REDLINING, so I bought a book ***""The Color of Law"".  The forgotten History of how our Government Segregated America.*** I could not believe it. It was very hard for me to understand such amount of evil-doing. The only other system I know with such a great evilness is Communism. But, in Communism you are discriminated against for POLITICAL, not RACIAL reasons. I went to school with every other kid of every other race, or skin color. We all lived in the same *barrio.* We all went to the same schools. We all dated whichever girls. It took a great deal of studying, and researching in order to comprehend REDLINING, JIM CROW, and all these other segregation  Laws. It was extremely hard.']"

Ironic considering your commentary.   I will not deny I have not read The Civil War in France (1870) yet but besides that there’s nothing else you have said that has been further from the truth so fuck off with your profiling.  You said Marx had a different view of the Dictatorship of the proletariat from what MLs claim it to be. You also gave a very poor characterization of what MLs believe the DOTP to be. I detest people who do this type of shit then give a fucking Wikipedia article as their reference. The more politically charged a topic is the more a knowledge database where supposedly EVERYONE can contribute to the development of it has so many holes in how a communist could just take it with a grain of salt. Quotes can be cherry picked so easily it’s just more irony of the situation considering your original call out was about taking Marx out of context.   Lenin has already said plenty about the counter arguments posed by Kautsky in the 2nd International regarding Marx’s commentary on the DOTP (which is where you’re getting this from whether you’re aware of it or not):  ”Let us point out, in passing, that when calling the non-Bolsheviks in Russia, i.e., the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, socialists, Kautsky was guided by their name, that is, by a word, and not by the actual place they occupy in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. What a wonderful understanding and application of Marxism!”  “The question of the dictatorship of the proletariat is a question of the relation of the proletarian state to the bourgeois state, of proletarian democracy to bourgeois democracy. One would think that this is as plain as a pikestaff. But Kautsky, like a schoolmaster who has become as dry as dust from quoting the same old textbooks on history, persistently turns his back on the twentieth century and his face to the eighteenth century, and for the hundredth time, in a number of paragraphs, in an incredibly tedious fashion chews the old cud over the relation of bourgeois democracy to absolutism and medievalism!”  “But this means he utterly fails to understand what is what! One cannot help smiling at Kautsky’s effort to make it appear that there are people who preach “contempt for democracy” (p. 11) and so forth. That is the sort of twaddle Kautsky uses to befog and confuse the issue, for he talks like the liberals, speaking of democracy in general, and not of *bourgeois democracy*[my italics]; he even avoids using this precise, class term, and, instead, tries to speak about “presocialist” democracy. This windbag devotes almost one-third of his pamphlet, twenty pages out of sixty-three, to this twaddle, which is so agreeable to the bourgeoisie, for it is tantamount to embellishing bourgeois democracy, and obscures the question of the proletarian revolution.”  This view” (which Kautsky dubs “contempt for democracy”) “rests upon a single word of Karl Marx’s”. This is what Kautsky literally says on page 20. And on page 60 the same thing is repeated even in the form that they (the Bolsheviks) “opportunely recalled the little word” (that is literally what he says—des Wörtchens!!) “about the dictatorship of the proletariat which Marx once used in 1875 in a letter”.  Here is Marx’s “little word"":   First of all, to call this classical reasoning of Marx’s, which sums up the whole of his revolutionary teaching, “a single word” and even “a little word,” is an insult to and complete renunciation of Marxism. It must not be forgotten that Kautsky knows Marx almost by heart, and, judging by all he has written, he has in his desk, or in his head, a number of pigeon-holes in which all that was ever written by Marx is most carefully filed so as to be ready at hand for quotation. Kautsky must know that both Marx and Engels, in their letters as well as in their published works, repeatedly spoke about the dictatorship of the proletariat, before and especially after the Paris Commune. Kautsky must know that the formula “dictatorship of the proletariat” is merely a more historically concrete and scientifically exact formulation of the proletariat’s task of “smashing” the bourgeois state machine, about which both Marx and Engels, in summing up the experience of the Revolution of 1848, and, still more so, of 1871, spoke for forty years, between 1852 and 1891.”   [All of this and plenty more can be found in the 1st chapter of Lenin’s *The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/common_liberal.htm)   I doubt you will read all of this much like you won’t read that book but I’m plenty read on the subject of the dictatorship of the proletariat. How about you sit down with your pseudo-intellectual garbage like the rest of the anarchists and put your head down and do the actual reading.']"

If anything the time periods were when less CO2 was sequestered meaning that temperature and CO2 are correlating factors, this is corroborated with my graph previously linked where temperature trends lasg behind CO2 trends. Thank you for pointing that out.   Yes evidence that they chose and often misinterpreted or old data that isn't still accepted. They often choose to ignore progress in fields such as remote sensing which has been key to our progression in the climatology field.   Lastly they never presented a comprehensive model that has higher predictive power than the ones in circulation today. While they often are starting issues with modeling as a whole or older issues we have worked past they fail to then quantify and qualify their implications to the models at play already. Also the IPCC is a report not a model so it's not the strongest form of evidence."", 'Basically, humans are dipping into fossil fuel reserves locked up underground by natural geologic processes of the carbon cycle and releasing carbon dioxide into the air. Carbon dioxide is a gas that traps heat (which is a greenhouse gas), so the more of it there is in the atmosphere, the warmer it gets. We keep on adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, so we are continuing to cause warming. However, it isn’t as simple as adding carbon dioxide directly increases warming. The addition of carbon dioxide and subsequent warming causes instabilities in other parts of the earth system, for example the salt concentration of ocean water. The warming causes melting of ice caps, which lessen the saltiness of sea water and disrupt ocean currents. As I mentioned before, the disruption of the Gulf Stream by the melting of Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice cap could disrupt the flow of the Gulf Stream to Europe, thereby plunging Europe into freezing temperatures as it is in a high latitude and is only kept mild by the warm Gulf Stream current. This is just one example, and the gist of it is that the addition of co2 to the atmosphere will cause a chain reaction of climate effects that will be entirely unpredictable. The only thing we can predict is the increase in atmospheric co2 concentrations, which will inevitably destabilize the climate. And the natural climate cycles never happen this quickly. Sure, we have the odd volcanic eruption that results in cooling, or increased solar activity that results in a little bit of warming, but we have seen an unprecedented increase in warming over the last 100 years, which directly correlates to the addition of co2 to the atmosphere by humans. Natural cycles do not cause change on such short scales, the processes that change the temperature/climate of earth either release co2 into the atmosphere (weathering of rock), or affect earths orbit/position (milankovitch cycles) operate on 1,000s to 100,000s of years. Meanwhile, this change has been occurring over little more than a century and directly parallels human consumption of fossil fuels, and is rising exponentially instead of at a steady rate. By the way, I learned a lot of this in my environmental science class but also through research.']"

For example, in a market socialist system (system in which there are a bunch of companies that compete with one another \\[similar to capitalism\\] but each business is collectively owned and operated by the workers of that specific business rather than a single individual or a group of wealthy shareholders), people are still greedy and will still act in their self interest. But, due to businesses being owned collectively amongst the workers, the profits of that business are more evenly shared and thus wealth inequality is lower and thus it is a lot more difficult for any one individual to easily corrupt the political system.

Or will they just eventually ban physical money, so you can be cut off on a whim?  Income tax is very authoritarian and would not be a net add for society.  Obviously you and I both believe in limits on these things and checks on government authority to enforce the rules. Can we not just accept that as a baseline?"", 'I’ve been a working adult, responsible for his own income and household, through 2 periods of economic uncertainty :  2000/2001 (the dot come bubble and 9/11 attacks) and 2007-2010 (otherwise known as the Global Financial Crisis).    What I found jn both instances was that cash became a very powerful tool for buying big ticket items, even if you aren’t spending as much on those items.  It’s the expansion of your own debt that you need to watch in good economic times, and especially when times are uncertain.  It became very hard to in 2009 and for a few years after, even, as lending standards tightened up.    I expect that the GFC was an extreme outlier in its severity, but I also know that the “recession” of 2020 was not nearly as significant as it might have been.  I understand that the recession of 1980-1981 was quite significant as well, and I recall my parents tightening up their spending a lot, though I was just then school age.  That’s more what I expect this go ‘round.  Lending on big ticket purchases will be very difficult, think homes and cars, and the unemployment number might be quite elevated, 6-8%.  Could be worse than that, but I believe a demographic shift has occurred the past 2-4 years, with much of the older workforce stepping away for what they hope is forever.    For investors, being ready to deploy capital will be imperative.  For those of us “little people”, we need to have 3-6 months of our bills saved up in liquid cash.  If one’s job and income holds steady throughout, yeah, great opportunity to perhaps score a home or a used auto for what will seem like a “deal” compared to the inflation in everything these past couple years.', "" Right off the bat, I would like to point out that the effect of interest rates on the marginal propensity to save and invest is much harder to deduce empirically than the macroeconomic wisdom would suggest. Additionally, since the majority of Bank lending is against real estate, most of the action has to take place through the so-called wealth effect. Again, it's tough to show a strong empirical relationship here.  Additionally, while raising interest may slow Bank lending to some degree, it increases government deficit spending. If government deficit spending increases more than the decrease in private credit creation, then the policy ends up being inflationary rather than deflationary. The bigger the government deficit, the truer this is. And I don't think I have to tell you that government deficits have been pretty high in recent history.  But okay, let's assume there IS a deflationary impact from raising interest rates. Let's assume that Banks start lending less to businesses, and consumers start taking on less debt (which is directly contrary to the recent evidence that shows an INCREASE, not a decrease, in private sector debt, but w/e). How is this supposed to help the economically precarious who are living paycheck to paycheck? They have little to no savings, so the incentives to save vs invest mean very little. Meanwhile, decreased investment and demand means higher unemployment. Even if we manage to get prices under control, it comes at the expense of the material well-being of all the newly unemployed people. People with good job security might benefit from this, but the most disposable and economically precarious workers will be hurt the most. So this ends up being a pretty regressive policy.  You can see this even more clearly when you look at who hire interest rates benefit, i.e., savers. Raising interest rates is a policy choice to give people with money free interest income from Treasury securities. It clearly benefits the most those with the most money to save. In a relatively unequal society like ours, where the wealth is already flowing increasingly to a smaller and smaller number of people at the very top, why would we want such a regressive policy?  If inflation is the problem, interest rates are not the answer. First, because interest rate policy is clearly just not super effective at controlling inflation. Second, it is a regressive policy that prioritizes the wealth of the already well off over the material well-being of the worst off.  To the extent that inflation is a problem, the solution is not monetary but fiscal policy. By tightening the fiscal stance in a progressive manner, we can reduce or reverse the growth of the money supply while making sure that it does not come at the cost of the material well-being of the most vulnerable in our society. It may seem difficult or even impossible to find the political will to do this; nonetheless, it is the only real effective solution. Interest rate policy is the fed's hammer, and it will use it whether or not it is truly the right tool for the job. But the true fiscal power lies with Congress.""]"

They also have some options for automation that you really can't do without specific support for it, such as having the car pull out of a parking spot on its own, or cooling the cabin before you get back.  The reason you buy a luxury car is comfort, and the traditional mindset is that before adding a feature to a car it should be robust, reliable, and perfect. Tesla does not really play by those rules, so they provide tons of quality of life features through software updates, and I think it will be a while until competitors wise up to this and start presenting similar offerings. Until then, people who want Teslas and their features will likely be a capitive market, maybe a small and non-viable one eventually, but specs and reliability does not a good user experience make.

It takes a whole lot of money to win a land war in asia."", "" I pay attention to what our government spokesmen say and consider the implications.   Disbanding NATO is a little extreme. It's plausible that NATO will become less important over time, because Russia is not a threat. Traditionally the USA was top dog there, because we had the military strength and western europeans believed they could not defend themselves from Russia without us. That belief may be gone now. We'll see.   It sounds like you're unclear on the concept. Generals generally try to be ready to refight the last war. If they lost the last war, they realize they need to do something different. But doing something different costs more than maintaining an existing approach.   Yes, we had no concept how we could create a peace. We never caught up to reality. Our OODA loop was around 6 months, so every 6 months we would notice that our existing approach wasn't working, and we'd announce a new approach which would take 6 months to confirm also didn't work.   But that's military strategy, which is below Congress's pay grade. Congress can mostly increase funding or decrease funding. In recent decades Congress has always increased funding. We can discuss why.    I don't know. I hope we don't.   China is our main excuse to increase military spending. We are in an arms race with them. But if we aren't going to fight them, why would their military spending affect ours?  Maybe we could fight them to defend Taiwan. But China probably won't invade Taiwan. If they do that, they can expect to win a smoking ruin. They do better to get Taiwan to reconcile with them. MAYBE they will attack Taiwan, but I don't think our CIA knows how to make them do that. We were effective at getting Russia to invade Ukraine, but I doubt we could make China invade Taiwan.  Our deep-water Navy is much better than China's and probably will be until there's some big new breakthrough. Aircraft carriers beat battleships, and nothing has beat aircraft carriers yet. Except they are so very expensive and slow to build, so we spend more and more resources defending them instead of attacking with them. Anyway, if the time comes that some new technology makes them fail -- a big swarm of cheap drones, say -- we won't give up on them until at least one of them is sunk or badly damaged, and then we will panic and start crash programs of various sorts. I can't predict when that will happen.  It seems extremely unlikely that China will invade the USA. Would they go through Siberia and Alaska and Canada? So to have the big war that we're preparing for -- that is the only possible military justification for our bloated military budget -- we would have to invade them.    I doubt it. It bothers me that our government leaders don't either. I look at what they do, and I can only hope that it makes no sense.

I think if people want to be inconsistent with their Anarchism, it\'s fine, *so long as* their inconsistency sides with Anarchism. That is, perhaps it\'s abstractly incorrect (again, a Christian anarchist would not see it this way) for the Christian part of Christian Anarchism to support Anarchism - but as long as Christian Anarchists support Anarchism over Christianity, I don\'t really care if their religious ideals are abstractly contradictory. If instead they were inconsistent *as Anarchists*, I would care - ie, patriarchy based in Christian faith is consistent with some forms of Christianity, but it\'s incompatible with Anarchism, so I care if an Anarchist Christian is patriarchal, because internal inconsistency in one\'s Anarchist principles *is* damaging to Anarchism.         Valid point. I typically speak in an ultimate sense, rather than an immediate one, but yes, in the immediate sense, AnCaps are not our allies, even accidentally. (I have other opinions on this that muddy this a bit, but they\'re not worth going into here.)         I\'ve never met an AnCap in real life, but I\'ve met plenty online, and I can say based on that that many of them are just Market Anarchists confused about what Capitalism is. (Not most, but many. Most are StateCorp boot-lickers, or StateCorp-adjacent.)      Market Anarchism (which I tend to call Market-Socialist Anarchism to remind people that it\'s a form of Socialism, not Capitalism - Market Anarchists tend to be badly misunderstood, even by fellow Anarchists) is a strain of Anarchism which states that markets are a good way of figuring out who wants/needs what, but that Capitalism is not a good market system. There are many strains of Market Anarchism, which arguably includes everything from Mutualism to Left-Rothbardianism, and everything in-between. (Left-Rothbardianism is an oddball ideology, I\'ll admit that much.) Anyhow, Market Anarchism essentially posits that markets (including money) can/should still exist in Anarchism. This basically just means ""Anarchists who are not AnCom."" Individual theories within the tradition have a variety of specific positions, but all are anti-Capitalism.      I personally am a Meta-Anarchist, so I\'d like to see AnCom and various communities with differing social and economic forms emerge within an Anarchist framework.

The threat of force is barely important for the functioning of all hierarchical societies. You make claims but you don’t defend them and, when you do, you fail.   This is word salad. Also not only do people not have to agree on everything, most of them *are not effected by that thing*.   Whatever you think I said doesn’t change the fact that it isn’t a strawman. It’s rich you think your fucking philosophy is the only kind of philosophy or that philosophy has any relevance to the question of “are you moving goalposts”.   Anarchy as “complete chaos” is actually workable and we can recontextualize “chaos” or “order” in all sorts of ways. Historical anarchists have done so, it isn’t as if “anarchy” didn’t mean “chaos” back then.   Not unless the general orders them to. And, by your logic, the people punching them should be in charge not the general because they’re not using violence at all.  See, there is literally no way you could argue that authority is derived from physical violence. It’s just not how things work.   Stop doing what? The general didn’t order them to punch people. He didn’t do anything at all.   This is nothing than a shoddy attempt at backpedaling. You’re arguing that authority is derived from violence but the authority in your situation hasn’t used violence at all.   If they’re using violence because the general ordered them to, the general hasn’t used violence. If they’re using violence because they love the general so much, *the general still didn’t use violence* (and also didn’t use their authority).  Either way, the general isn’t using violence nor, if the soldiers are going rogue, even commanding violence. Therefore the authority they have cannot be derived from violence.  This is another shitty argument that’s just as bad as the last one. You have a completely dogmatic attachment to the idea that authority = force. It’s fucking insane.   That’s circular logic. Their violence is only possible via equipment but they’re using violence to get that equipment? That doesn’t make sense.  In fact, the idea of a general strike relies on the fact that militaries need social support to exist. Without which they would be incapable of accomplishing anything. And equipment would be produced for the working class not rulers since they’re the ones who actually produce it.  Either way you’re wrong, they *buy* it or pay people to produce it. Literally every government does. That’s how thing actually work. Your ideas don’t resemble how reality actually works. That’s why it’s complete bullshit.   It isn’t. It’s achieved through literal houses of cards. Organizations are structured such that they depend on government for their existence. This leads to compliance with governmental authority and.in turn, obtains compliance elsewhere.   Those higher up in organizations and even those lower down don’t have any major incentive to disobey. For those higher up it’s the opposite. And the dominance of hierarchy everywhere along with its reliance upon government forces people to comply.   Yes they are words. Good job! Now read them.  Justification means “acting without consequence”. Any other meanings are non-material and therefore not necessary.   How old are you? You talk like it’s your first day speaking English.']"

This industry is also responsible for at least 60% of global deforestation, including more than 75% in the Amazon, which significantly increases CO2 emissions and affects carbon sinks. I could also talk about soil contamination, of which 30% of the degradation is attributable to the meat industry. Or the contamination of water tables and rivers or the massive use of land.

Jerusalem was cleared of Jews for the first time since Roman times. No Jews were allowed to remain in the West Bank where they had lived for centuries.
