I’m somewhat involved in Republican politics in Ohio, and we had sex at a friends house whose parents are extremely wealthy, extremely Christian, republicans, and they found his wallet that had his deadname on it. They told our friend that they didn’t want “people like that” in their house, and I realized everyone I spent hours talking to, eating with, and other things politically. Would never support our relationship. I mean he was a trans Jew, and I was a well. Me.   I’m not a good man by any means. I messed things up with him, and others many times, but when I told him I was having doubts. He didn’t ask me to leave my party, stop my work, denounce republicanism, or Catholicism. He said “You can be one of the good ones.”   I miss him more than he could ever know. He believed in me. He saw the best in me. He respected me for who I am, and so I try my very best to respect others. I don’t always succeed. I’m sure if you go through my account you’ll see me being offensive; but I try. I try to be one of the good ones.  Edit: the comment got deleted that’s why I posted this, also sorry for any spelling mistakes.', "" Pissed off citizens calling for violence is not the same thing as a presidential candidate calling for the overturning of the Constitution so that he may be installed as the new president without having been elected. Again these are so far beyond comparable that it astonishes me that you can bring them up in the same sentence without forgetting how to breathe.   You'll notice that unlike the Republicans on January 6th, those Resistance types didn't go through with those threats. Honestly I think that right there is a perfect illustration of the difference between the Republican party and the Democrats at this point.   I'm sure a lot of Germans could much better afford to feed their families after Hitler overthrew the Weimar Republic too, but you'd be absolutely insane to argue that his overthrow of the Weimar Republic wasn't an unimaginable tragedy. Without democracy a nation and it's government is worth little more than the spit that should fly at them. There can be no human rights without democracy, and so a threat to my right to vote is a threat against every right I have.  Also I just want to point out how funny it is that you give Trump credit for how well the economy was doing during his presidency when he did barely anything and mostly just a Road off of the coattails of the successful economy given to him by Obama, whereas Biden was forced to pull us out of a pandemic while his opposition was doing everything in their power to undermine the ability of the nation to deal with that pandemic in any way shape or form. Just saying it's funny how you are appealing to your economic well-being and security when you are supporting a party and individual who's economic policies are horrendously dangerous for this country."", ' My current job is one of passions. But it was a passion that developed over time.

The first person could have graduated high school first as a plan B. The second person could have found a job in the other country first but they moved quickly. The third person could have become a senior UXer or been a part time consultant or a 1 hr a week boot camp teacher or something to keep her ""in the industry"" while pursuing animation.   A few people mentioned they all lacked back up plans which is what I think the real issue was.    I feel no one is passionate about just one thing in life and this thread did help me see that people have different ideas of success. But your 20s is when you are supposed to do these wild swings and opportunities like these aren\'t exactly common so I do understand now why they wanted to take these.   I still think the people who told them ""Follow your passions"" were very aware of what was actually gonna happen to them and chose to keep their mouths shut, but I also think people do need the space to try new things. They all could have bailed on their passions when they got hard but they didn\'t.   That, to me, means they all were having the times of their lives during these sprints and I am happy I can finally see it that way.']"

Academia is like the rest of society on a fundamental level determined by class-society. If the perspective on the economy is based on the perspective that what is good for the corporations is good for society then of course the ""truth"" that will be found is that exploitation of the working-class is good and needs to be intensified or that an 8% unemployment rate is needed.   There are of course individual academics that are good but they can often be few and far in between.   Historically the labor movement built its own educational organizations to seek the truth from the working-class perspective, and might have taken help from individual academics or intellectuals. In places like Sweden we still have ""Arbetarnas bildningsförbund""(workers\' educational association) that started in 1912 and have all labor movement organisations as members(trade unions, Social-democrats, Left Party, etc). They train people to hold study circles and financially support courses in politics, trade union courses, language and writing, economics, arts, and so on.', 'It\'s some seriously self aware wolves shit from them:  AmericaFest is hosted by right-wing organization\xa0Turning Point USA\xa0and was founded by conservative activist Charlie Kirk.  The Left may report on these grifters but it is the right who platforms them and creates the need for such a response.  The left reports on these lunatics keep average citizens aware of the extreme rhetoric on the right. Without traditional media reporting on this, the extremists create their own bubble and the ""less extreme"" would be able to write them off as ""lone wolf""s and ""loonies"" but the very idea of free speec as outlined in John Milton\'s Areopagitica requires this sort of response to less rational actors in order to maintain some expectation of rationality in responses to absurdity.  Meanwhile, the extreme right constantly tries to present people using social media to express themselves, as cringe as it might be, as though that is indicative of the entirety of the democratic party.  It\'s some downright ridiculous absurdist argumentation from a clown of a clout chaser who only has a voice in the political sphere because his father helps to embolden these sorts of political tactics through abuse of the bully pulpit.', ""My favorite explanation, by Rothbard, has it going back earlier still. That what began as a liberal revolution in the 18 th century, they made unprecedented gains in overthrowing monarchy globally, soon shifted to a rearguard action where they began defending what they had gained rather than pushing forward with further gains.  A radical creed became in this way a conservative defensive, over time. The liberals of that day abandoned radicalism, thinking that society would evolve naturally over the next eons towards liberty, under the cultural influence of darwinism.  He specifically singles out Herbert Spencer as emblematic of this ideological shift.  But I think the problem of that day was primarily a deficit in theory. They did not have adequate theory to understand how to apply the principle of liberty any further than they had achieved.  The old regime was overthrown because they knew very well what they were against, but they did not know well what kind and shape of society could be built that was in line with the philosophy of liberty.  Only with the resurgence of liberty ideology after WW2 with Rothbard, Friedman, and Mises do we get a resurgence of theory such as arguably hadn't been occurring for a few decades, or with only a few figures.  During that time, the mantle of the radical opposition group was taken up by the Marxists, who are unfortunately a false revolution.  And I would say that's the main reason why we have trouble getting off the ground currently, people who recognize there's something wrong with the system are too often being driven towards Marxism as the solution, whereas they used to be driven into classical liberalism ideas.  For a resurgence of liberty philosophy, it may be necessary for socialism to first die or be rejected as a liberal creed.  But that's not happening, and in fact it grows like some kind of virus. Because it feeds on the wrongs of the current system.""]"

The points still stand in general though, since conservatives are largely against sex education and easy access to contraceptives.   The overwhelming majority of anti-abortion people are religious, the entire movement is founded by modern religious groups. Once they die out, so will their ""cause"".   It\'s not alive, it\'s not the same as killing a baby that\'s alive. It seems like you\'re aiming for a ""gotcha"" here by pointing out that you can be charged with murder for causing the unwanted termination of a fetus, but that does not conflict with abortion. Abortion is the choice of the woman carrying the baby, kicking a pregnant woman is not the woman\'s choice, and that\'s why there is a law against it. That same law even has a provision explicitly stating that it does not apply when a woman consents to have an abortion.', ' All women are marginalized in a forced birth society, and women who would have been alive aside from abortion bans are killed BY YOU.  Just because sometimes people die naturally does not make killing women okay. Would you accept it if I told you that abortion is perfectly fine because sometimes fetuses die?   FORCED pregnancy is not okay.   FORCED pregnancy is not okay. FORCED pregnancy is rape. You seek to rape and kill women through FORCED pregnancy.   Some people may have a heart attack naturally but it\'s not okay to deliberately give someone a heart attack.  Some people may die naturally but it\'s not okay to kill them.  Some women die in childbirth but it\'s not okay to kill women in childbirth.

Do you beat your wife to a pulp every night? Do you go around raping every woman you see? Why not? it\'s not killing us. Praise modern medicine! Amirite?   ANd when you FORCE a woman to stay pregnant and give birth, she is neither choosing to stay pregnant or accepting that risk. If she dies, YOU KILLED HER.   And you\'re perfectly fine with killing us in forced childbirth. You are pro-killing-women. Just say it. Just say that you want us dead.   It is if you\'re KILLING SOMEONE THROUGH FORCED BIRTH. If they could have gotten an abortion and didn\'t because of PL laws, PLERS KILLED HER. YOU KILLED HER.  Admit you\'re in favor of women dying to ""save babies."" Just say it. Say you\'re not in favor of protecting ALL life because you want women dead.   Allowing abortions allows women to get abortions and avoid childbirth. Abortion is far far safer than childbirth, and allowing every woman who wants an abortion to get one ensures that nobody is FORCED to risk death.   You don\'t, because they don\'t work. Women still die and you are fine with it. You say ""some women die, and it\'s tragic,"" and shrug and walk away. You rationalize it by saying it\'s perfectly fine to visit any level of violence on a woman you want--you may rape us, beat us, maim us, brutalize us--as long as you don\'t *kill* us.

""Our deaths are tragic but THINK OF THE BABIES,"" you say. ""I\'m fine with you dying,"" you say. Just admit it. Just own it. You\'re just as much of a murderer as you think I am.

I'm not only pro choice I'm actively pro abortion.  It is a fantastic medical procedure that is a great thing to be available to a society.  Being pregnant and giving birth even if you plan to give it up for adoption is a life changing and stressful thing not to mention it can wreck your body.  Abortions have also prevented millions of kids being born into absolute terrible situations with basically zero chance of growing up normal and living a normal life.  If the adoption system in America and foster homes in this country weren't a giant cluster fuck I might lean a little more towards giving up for an adoption.  Not to mention lots of people get pregnant at a point in their life where having and raising a kid is not really an option.  Abortions have helped millions of people.  Again, a clump of cells that relies on being connected to a human to survive is not a person and is not alive.  You nut jobs can are somehow unable to understand this.  Let's assume they are, though. You have no thoughts or recollection of any of that.  It's really not a life.  If someone aborted me at 7 months I'd never have even realized it.  Also, assume abortion was made federally illegal.  What's your grand plan for all of these millions of kids born into terrible situations or given up for adoption?  You realize most people getting abortions aren't soccer moms that live in the suburbs, right?  They are poor people or people in bad situations that realize they are not in a situation to raise a child.  So you think the best option is basically force millions of people into a poor life of struggling and suffering vs aborting something that has no memory, thoughts, and will never even know they were going to exist and is the best option for all parties involved?  Get the fuck out of here with that ridiculousness.  If you don't agree with abortion then that's perfectly OK. Don't facilitate one or be with someone that approves of them.  But stay the fuck out of everyone else's life and ability to make this decision for themselves because in your opinion it's wrong.

You made something or performed a service and you sold that for its market value.  The founders would not recognize a person who sells their labor on an hourly basis (because they lack the means to create saleable product) as a free person.      Capitalism took root in America during the railroad revolution, and that put the new wageslave system in to direct competition with southern chattel slavery.      Advantages to wageslaves are that they have to pay for their own housing, food and medical care and a wageslave who is unable to work due to illness or injury presents no liability for the enterprise. They can be replaced.  You don't get stuck owning a slave who is injured, or can no longer produce a full day of work.    Most importantly the wageslave system outcompeted traditional slavery because wageslaves work harder, believing it to be in their interest as they seek advancement.     But because the American wage system evolved to fulfill the same production needs as slavery it's not like work systems in the rest of the world.  It's primary advantages were severability of employment, and that owners had no need to provide for living conditions.    The ability for business owners to maximize profit while providing as little as possible to workers is the foundation of American capitalism."", ' I think for something to be considered a ""criticism"" of a certain economic system, it doesn\'t necessarily have to be exclusive to that economic system, but that the downside or ""con"" is much more apparent in one over the other.  Humans don\'t magically stop being greedy under other economic systems. For example, in a market socialist system (system in which there are a bunch of companies that compete with one another \\[similar to capitalism\\] but each business is collectively owned and operated by the workers of that specific business rather than a single individual or a group of wealthy shareholders), people are still greedy and will still act in their self interest. But, due to businesses being owned collectively amongst the workers, the profits of that business are more evenly shared and thus wealth inequality is lower and thus it is a lot more difficult for any one individual to easily corrupt the political system. Is it still \\*technically\\* possible for there to be corruption in a market socialist system? Yes....but it is much harder and much less likely.  The fact that capitalism makes it more likely that the political system and politicians can become corrupted makes it a valid criticism imo.', 'TL;DR stay a western shit-lib   If you actually read the content of those conversations where I ask for sources you’d find that they often have a running theme of me calling out people who make outlandish claims about communist political and economic topics. Ironic considering your commentary.   I will not deny I have not read The Civil War in France (1870) yet but besides that there’s nothing else you have said that has been further from the truth so fuck off with your profiling.  You said Marx had a different view of the Dictatorship of the proletariat from what MLs claim it to be. You also gave a very poor characterization of what MLs believe the DOTP to be. I detest people who do this type of shit then give a fucking Wikipedia article as their reference. The more politically charged a topic is the more a knowledge database where supposedly EVERYONE can contribute to the development of it has so many holes in how a communist could just take it with a grain of salt. Quotes can be cherry picked so easily it’s just more irony of the situation considering your original call out was about taking Marx out of context.   Lenin has already said plenty about the counter arguments posed by Kautsky in the 2nd International regarding Marx’s commentary on the DOTP (which is where you’re getting this from whether you’re aware of it or not):  ”Let us point out, in passing, that when calling the non-Bolsheviks in Russia, i.e., the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, socialists, Kautsky was guided by their name, that is, by a word, and not by the actual place they occupy in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. What a wonderful understanding and application of Marxism!”  “The question of the dictatorship of the proletariat is a question of the relation of the proletarian state to the bourgeois state, of proletarian democracy to bourgeois democracy. One would think that this is as plain as a pikestaff. But Kautsky, like a schoolmaster who has become as dry as dust from quoting the same old textbooks on history, persistently turns his back on the twentieth century and his face to the eighteenth century, and for the hundredth time, in a number of paragraphs, in an incredibly tedious fashion chews the old cud over the relation of bourgeois democracy to absolutism and medievalism!”  “But this means he utterly fails to understand what is what! One cannot help smiling at Kautsky’s effort to make it appear that there are people who preach “contempt for democracy” (p. 11) and so forth. That is the sort of twaddle Kautsky uses to befog and confuse the issue, for he talks like the liberals, speaking of democracy in general, and not of *bourgeois democracy*[my italics]; he even avoids using this precise, class term, and, instead, tries to speak about “presocialist” democracy. This windbag devotes almost one-third of his pamphlet, twenty pages out of sixty-three, to this twaddle, which is so agreeable to the bourgeoisie, for it is tantamount to embellishing bourgeois democracy, and obscures the question of the proletarian revolution.”  This view” (which Kautsky dubs “contempt for democracy”) “rests upon a single word of Karl Marx’s”. This is what Kautsky literally says on page 20. And on page 60 the same thing is repeated even in the form that they (the Bolsheviks) “opportunely recalled the little word” (that is literally what he says—des Wörtchens!!) “about the dictatorship of the proletariat which Marx once used in 1875 in a letter”.  Here is Marx’s “little word"":   First of all, to call this classical reasoning of Marx’s, which sums up the whole of his revolutionary teaching, “a single word” and even “a little word,” is an insult to and complete renunciation of Marxism. It must not be forgotten that Kautsky knows Marx almost by heart, and, judging by all he has written, he has in his desk, or in his head, a number of pigeon-holes in which all that was ever written by Marx is most carefully filed so as to be ready at hand for quotation. Kautsky must know that both Marx and Engels, in their letters as well as in their published works, repeatedly spoke about the dictatorship of the proletariat, before and especially after the Paris Commune. Kautsky must know that the formula “dictatorship of the proletariat” is merely a more historically concrete and scientifically exact formulation of the proletariat’s task of “smashing” the bourgeois state machine, about which both Marx and Engels, in summing up the experience of the Revolution of 1848, and, still more so, of 1871, spoke for forty years, between 1852 and 1891.”   [All of this and plenty more can be found in the 1st chapter of Lenin’s *The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/common_liberal.htm)   I doubt you will read all of this much like you won’t read that book but I’m plenty read on the subject of the dictatorship of the proletariat. How about you sit down with your pseudo-intellectual garbage like the rest of the anarchists and put your head down and do the actual reading.']"

There are direct analogs between the Roman Greek deities and the Hindu ones and Hitler was a bit obsessed with paganism in general, just like white supremacists today. It's actually not at all surprising. Even things like the caste system were the norm in the west until paganism ended.  Fun fact... Hindu names of days are named exactly in the same sequence as in Latin.  For example, in Latin languages like French, Wednesday is mercredi... Mercury's day. In Hindi, Wednesday is Budhavar, where Budha is the Hindu name of mercury the planet and mercury/Hermes the god. Budha is the son of father Brihaspati, which is the Hindu name of Jupiter the planet as well as the sky god. Hinduism then collected random other gods along the way, but the core indo European matrix is there.  Like Zeus and Jupiter, Brihaspati  is the teacher /guru of the lesser gods.  There are some disconnects. For the example, the word Jupiter comes from indo European Dyeus pitar, which is actually a separate Hindu god (named Dyauspitar) not associated with Thursday. He's most equivalent to chronos or Uranus.  Anyway, the point is that anyone interested in European paganism would naturally look eastward to India, since there are no European pagans anymore and the closest extant religion that shares an unbroken line to Greek and roman paganism is Hinduism.."", 'Yes of course! As Paul says when sin increased grace increased all the more and Paul should know. He called himself ""chief of sinners"" because of the time he spent hunting and murdering Christians.  The problem is that twisting scripture in small ways can lead to disastrous outcomes. This exact thing has happened with many scriptures. Where this conversation was going was ""well we\'re all sinners so does [this] sin even matter?"" Views that make light of sin always lead to sin .It\'s been the same discussion for almost 2 thousand years now. ""Well wouldn\'t more sin mean more grace?"" Paul responds to this in Romans 6.  What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 2 By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 3 Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.  Notice the exclamation mark after by no means. It\'s not very common in scripture. The words are very strong in the greek.   Anyone who would wish to be a Christian must understand the danger of sin and choose a life of fighting to be free of it by the spirit. Scripture tells us that those who take sin lightly either don\'t understand the high price that was paid for redemption or don\'t appreciate it anyway (hebrews 10:29) and will lose the grace given to them. Christ paid a high price with his own blood and suffering. The word excruciating was created to describe the unimaginable pain of literally tearing your body apart as you fight to take a breath (the cross actually kills by asphyxiation). He gave everything to put an end to sin. He expects people to respect the gravity of the situation   But yes all sin can be redeemed but twisting scripture to make certain sins look less dangerous only leads to dangerous places. If you want to know more the Book of 1 John that was half about this subject to address a similar lie that was putting greek believers in danger.

After all if you can be convinced of this then you can frankly be convinced of anything by anyone with an R next to their name.   Not true at all. Practically all crime happens predominantly in cities because that's where you just have the most people squished the most closely together. Of course there's going to be more crime when you have a hundred people in a room rather than five. That doesn't imply anything about the political leanings of the criminals, but what does imply something about the political leanings of the criminals was the degree to which right-wing pundits such as those on Fox News and even Donald Trump himself went out of his way to convince people that it was a bio-weapon that was developed and released specifically to attack the United States.   You are being extremely over-dramatic, all questioning wasn't banned. People who were very prominently spreading the worst and most extreme and unfounded of conspiracy theories were deprioritized in the algorithm, and everyone else had a little notation put under their post explaining to readers why the post is wrong. That isn't Banning speech by any stretch of the imagination.""]"

If one doesn't consider the project already failed and more or less ceded to the Russian Federation.   Most of the communists, those of a more international position, who were associated with the projects of Lugansk and Donetsk republics have fled, hid or died in various assassinations and artillery shellings. The communists were seen as the larger threat, as they specifically addressed ethnic Ukrainians in the Ukrainian language in their propaganda. They were primary targets of the post-coup Ukrainian government. For them, Donetsk and Lugansk were supposed to be successors of a legitimate Ukrainian SR, that could potentially grow if more people rebelled against the coup. The Dugin-influenced patsoc's are more friendly to the Russian Federation. Safety for ethnic Russians, rather than socialism, is the core of their position, so they get better protection from Russia. They have become the primary political force in the separatist regions.   While these ethnically Russian Patsoc's are obviously quite wrong, and dangerous to minorities in Russia, they did not spring from nowhere. There are tens of thousands of stateless ethnic Russians who were denied citizenship and rights in various post-soviet states, including Ukraine, and lacked the means to go somewhere else at their own expense, as was demanded by the new states. While there is plenty to be said for Russian imperialism before the revolution and their status as a dominant or preferred ethnicity in conquered territory, and for chauvinist attitudes in later years, that is not the universal experience. It also doesn't help that they adopt a nostalgia for the Soviet Union and its imagery, but without socialist politics, which is shallow and deceptive.   At best, one could argue that they make the necessary compromises to mobilize ethnic Russians against western capitalist influence. At worst, and I'm quite pessimistic, they belong to capitalists more fully than they admit and lack revolutionary potential on the basis of that ethnocentrism. But I can acknowledge people who hold the former view as comrades even if I don't do the same with regards to the governments and organizations in question."", ""You'll appreciate these:  A cyber cat-and-mouse game ensued, with the United States, Britain and other allies helping to shore up Ukrainian computers and stave off Russian intrusions.  On Feb. 23, hours before the invasion began, Sandworm took another swing, launching malware that infected several hundred Ukrainian government computers, officials said. The intrusion was detected quickly, the damage contained.  Then Sandworm struck again. But the code it used looked like it had been thrown together at the last minute, with programming errors — another fail.  Sandworm wasn’t done. In its boldest stroke yet, it went after the Ukrainian military’s satellite communications, used by soldiers in the field. It worked, and by 6:15 a.m. on Feb. 24, the system went down, right at Ukraine’s most vulnerable moment.  It could have been a crippling blow. But the Ukrainian government had a backup plan: a separate satellite communications system, which it had tested only two months before, to make sure it was ready in the event of a Russian invasion.    ...  Ukrainian law enforcement officials started noticing something else suspicious as well: a spike in foreign cellphone numbers near the border, in the forests between Ukraine and Belarus.  Russian soldiers were using cellphones to call home, and suddenly popping up on Ukrainian networks. Officials who monitor the traffic during peacetime for criminal activity quickly realized they could see and hear the invaders approaching in real time.  “We listened to the Russian soldiers as they panicked and called their friends and relatives,” said an official who oversees the phone intercepts. “They used ordinary phones to make decisions about their further moves.”  Down long corridors guarded by locks with facial detection, behind doors sealed with wax to detect intruders, teams of women tracked the Russian troops from small listening booths while their friends and relatives grabbed rifles to patrol the streets.  “We understood where the enemy was, what numbers they were using,” the official said.  The eavesdroppers passed the details to Ukraine’s armed forces to carry out ambushes and counterattacks. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, said Ukrainian forces used cellphone signals and even TikTok videos to target a unit of Chechen soldiers known as the Kadyrovtsy, named for the strongman leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.  It took 40 minutes from the time one video was uploaded to pinpoint the unit’s location near the Hostomel airport northwest of Kyiv, Mr. Budanov said. The Ukrainian military then hit them with three Tochka-U ballistic missiles, he said.  The Russians kept closing in on Kyiv, forcing the eavesdroppers tucked in listening rooms to make a quick decision: destroy their equipment and flee for their own safety, or hang on and continue gathering intelligence.  They stayed.  “We didn’t lose Ukraine. We didn’t let the enemy move further,” the official said. “On the first days, when they made foolish mistakes, we used their foolish mistakes to our advantage.”"", 'If El Paso had been embroiled in a separatist movement for 8 years yeah I really wouldn\'t have a problem with it, especially if not allowing El Paso to be independent meant the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives, massive damage to US infrastructure, and a decades spanning crippled economy. The Donbas and Eastern Ukraine has always been a contested area, even in the original elections those areas went to Ukraine by margins so narrow that in the US we would have held special elections for in many areas. Let\'s not pretend that these areas were the same as the rest of Ukraine, that Putin ever voiced interest in any area outside of these hotly contested areas, or that the people in these areas don\'t blame Ukraine for the war and not the Russians. You don\'t even have to read Russian sources, the financial times conducted interviews in Bakhmut and even the Ukrainian military in the area said that was a common sentiment in the area.   Let\'s also not forget that Zelensky ran on a platform of making peace with the Russians and ran on that platform but proceeded to do the opposite due to pressure from the West.   For the record I don\'t believe NATO troops are in Ukraine or that Ukraine is full of Nazis, I do believe that these areas of Ukraine have wanted independence for a long time, have fought for this independence for a long time, and that Ukraine doesn\'t really care all that much about these areas since they conducted shelling operations in these areas the day before the Russian invasion in violation of the Minsk accords. About dictators today that we support, Egypt? Saudi Arabia? Alegeria? Afghanistan (hardly a democracy, run by a warlord before that fell apart)? There are quite a few oppressive regimes and dictatorships we fund.  As for the Belt and Road initiative, how exactly is increasing a military budget going to help solve that? Are we going to start bombing countries for having Chinese funded infrastructure projects? It\'s not as though the Chinese government is sending its military to these places, they are using money and deals to gain and exercise power, and that\'s not something we can stop with guns and missiles. We can\'t just send soldiers to a country\'s port and say ""we own this now"", we\'d look like thugs because that\'s exactly what we would be.   Yes Russia is making friends in Iran and Syria. What the hell else do you expect them to do? We have cut them off from the rest of the world. We create enemies with our attempts at ""spreading democracy"" which is just code for ""we just want people in charge who we are friends with"" then cry and panic when it fails and other countries who we don\'t like make friends with the countries we made enemies out of. There is a reason why the Iranians don\'t like us and that\'s because we did a regime change in the 40\'s, the Syrians don\'t like us for the same reason.   Yes, as a NYC resident and native I\'m well aware of 9/11, but had our government exercised any competency it never would have happened, it was a preventable tragedy. All the whole war on terror, aka America\'s pissing contest with Islamofascists, did was make more people side with the Islamofascists because when your family is killed in a drone attack you lose all sympathy you may have had for some Americans that died in the WTC. Also, who was supporting the Taliban, Al-Queda, ISIS, and all these other groups before they attacked the US???? The US. WE CREATE OUR OWN PROBLEMS. The interventionism inevitably fails because we back losing causes, we increase resentment towards us, and our takeaway is that next time we should intervene harder. We are chasing the illusion that every country we dislike is like Nazi Germany and that if we win we can create a functional liberal democracy like we did there.   I think you overestimate Ukraine and misunderstand the Russian strategy, blitzing quickly may have been the original strategy but ever since April the new strategy has been the war of attrition, camp the positions, abandon areas that aren\'t defendable, and wait out Ukraine and it\'s working. Ukraine is running out of weapons, the new ones they are getting although more advanced cannot be maintained in the Ukraine and have to be sent to Germany for repairs (as the people who know how to fix them cannot be in Ukraine as the Russians would treat it as an act of war) and this will only further stress the already overworked supply lines into Ukraine. 100 billion dollars spent and can we really say that they caused 100 billion in damages to the Russian military or prevented 100 Billion dollars in damages to their own country? Most of Ukraine\'s energy grid is in the crapper, most are on the brink of starving or freezing this winter, is this what victory looks like? Was all this worth it?   I also think you overestimate effect of sanctions on Russia and underestimate the undeniably worse effect they have had on the West. Europe is going through an energy crisis, fertilizer increased in cost substantially, there are food shortages across the world. We have also permanently ensured that Russia will never rejoin the global financial system no matter who is in power because of the animosity we created by ceasing the assets of Russian civilians abroad. Now Russia and china are creating their own financial system which they will use with their new friends in the middle east to trade oil, which is a massive blow to the dollar.   I love America, I love the country, I love it\'s people, I love the constitution. What I don\'t love is our insane approach to foreign policy and our indifference towards the horrors of the wars we cause and escalate. If we stayed out of political conflicts in countries we don\'t understand and focused our efforts on development and improving our own country we wouldn\'t have these problems.']"

This needs to be a thing way before the purchase of a firearm, sooooo mental health support from a young age ….   That was canadas murder rate before they literally banned all firearms. That’s my whole point.

You act like other countries around the world all live in total harmony with no one being victimized. In a lot of these countries you can’t even defend yourself without being put on trial for murder because they don’t even let you defend yourself. Canada had hardly any violence in the first place and they started with “common sense gun laws” and now they’re pretty much banning all guns in canada lol. You also act like everyone in those countries agree with those laws which they don’t.   Weve had “military style weapons” for over a hundred years.  Gun ownership in America has risen drastically and overall violence has dropped drastically over the years. You’re just really not addressing any points I’m making here.   What do you propose is going to solve this problem ? Mental health checks and banning all semi automatic weapons ? Because it goes from “common sense” to banning almost everything pretty fast.  This is an issue where people advocating for gun laws know nothing about firearms and that’s clearly the case here with you. You should learn about something you’re advocating for before forming an opinion imo. Learn about the way firearms work and you’ll quickly figure out how this plays out.

The toxic element is where masculinity is taken to a point that harms men and harms the people around them that is often signal boosted by the cultural systems in play. There just isn\'t really a straight up equivalent for women. There\'s internalized misogyny where women do harmful things because of patriarchal systems, but there\'s no matriarchal systems that push women into harmful thoughts and actions.  It\'d be like trying to say systematic racism in the US needs an equivalent for minorities. Well, the systems in place just never existed where minorities could define racism and enforce their will on others. Are some minority individuals self-hating, perpetuating racism for power or money, straight up mean spirited or cruel? Sure, there\'s internalized racism, but there isn\'t quite the same concept as systematic racism.

A lot of stats suggest the change *increased* the number of students from lower income backgrounds who go to university (maybe because there are more maintenance grants for living costs for people on low incomes being funded by the new tuition fees), or at least, the number has increased regardless of that change. Also, like, it's theoretically always affordable, and it's important to understand how the system works, it's arguably pretty fair. You do take out a loan of around £9000 a year to pay for your course, but interest is taken as a percentage of income above about £27k a year, like a tax, after your graduate, and if in 30 years you haven't paid it off the rest is cancelled. So theoretically if someone leaves university and can't make much money they won't pay much at all, while the service is subsidised by high earners who got high-paying work from their degrees. Arguably it's a fairer system than funding from the taxpayer, if more complex.  At the end of the day, people who go to university on average will still make more over a lifetime than people who don't, including tuition fees and the years of lost work. I think the system as it is works fine to be honest, even if it is a bit bureaucratic and does ultimately saddle people with debt (that, at the same time, is not that bad as debt goes).""]"

Obviously, the general public doesn\'t have access to the kind of information that would go into such a decision; 90% of what management does is behind-the-scenes stuff that the customer neither knows nor cares about. Musk, assuming he\'s not even more of a fraud than I believe, *knows* this.  Even if that wasn\'t the case, throwing up a random Twitter poll one day isn\'t how you\'d do this. You\'d make sure that your userbase (or at least the subset you care about) would actually know to respond, and have some context behind what was going on.  So *obviously,* it\'s just another stupid stunt - one that has no real weight, but gives Musk the attention that he apparently needs to live, wrapped up in the pretense that it\'s going to do anything more than stroke his ego for five minutes. Oh, and of *course* he\'s going to point back to this one, stupid Twitter poll anytime somebody points out that he\'s killing the company.  It\'s just...

He is not stupid, regardless of what media tells you.  Who ever said anything about right/left? Are you that fucking programmed? That is NOT what we are discussing here in this conversation. He (Elon Musk) himself explained his political leanings. That he is a leftist, but they went so far left that he can no longer support ""the new thing."" He is left of center, meaning he respects a man\'s right to make money (through billions in government subsidies). He obviously had problems with how things were run. Sent data to two dependable journalists, and had them draw their own conclusions about what went down.

Do you guys seriously not see that your ( By ""your"" I mean the prevailing sentiment that is average of liberals as a collective I obviously can\'t speak for any of you individually)  hate for Musk seems to correlate with your leaders taking issue  with him.When your leaders take issue with or support something the media you consume will get busy indoctrination you with said perspective. This happens through repetition and through the affirmation from your peers who are being subjected to the same narrative.  This is true for both sides.   If you cannot see the inherent bias in your media and the flaws in your leaders as well as the positives in the opposition then its safe to say you\'ve been compromised and your being influenced, if not outright manipulated. Again this is true for most people regardless of their political leanings.   The reason why this is so Cleary the case with Musk is because most people give the see vague reasons why they dislike him.  Truth is he\'s bizzare because he\'s a very unique individual,  a one off,.he\'s highly intelligent in certain areas but lacks social intelligence.  This is actually extremely common for people like him.  People  talk crap about him being some elitist billionaire or being a narcissist or megalomaniac. He\'s none of those things.... well he is definitely a billionaire but other than his jet which honestly is a necessity when you are a CEO of a larğge and rapidly expanding international company.  But other than that he\'s not ai typical of some elitist D-bag billionaire.   Musk has enough money for neither him or his family to ever need to work again. I seriously mean never. Not his kids ,grandkids, great grand  kids etc. Yet all he does is work . For a while he had a tiny home  that he\'d stay in at the space X launch pad but I\'ve heard many talk about him often sleeping on the factory floor so he can keep getting things done if it calls for it.  He\'s singlehandedly responsible for the wide adoption of Evs. Because the innovations they\'ve made have  lowers  costs significantly.  They make great products that people enjoy and that will last a long time. Not only that but each of their products has the potential to make its owner money. But they have to make great products because they have no marketing department. When\'s the last time you\'ve seen a Tesla add or dealership? They don\'t have them which is friggin insane, completely unheard of for any large corporate producer of any product. This is why a socially awkward Musk is always stirring things up and causing a buzz with his tweets.Henis Teslas marketing department. That fact alone saves the company 100s of millions as year.  There\'s also the fact that once you understand his vision and how all of the products all of his companies are meant to be integrated. His vision of the future is a good one too. While billionaires like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates claim to be about the environment ,in reality that aren\'t. Instead they are about control.  All their ideas involve more regulations, less freedom for us,and more control for them. You\'ve got Gates preaching deportation and trying to get everyone to leave rural areas cand consolidate into major cities. Conveniently this will make people easier to control. But while he preaches that he\'s busy buying up as much farmland as he cN get his hands on. Gates is now the largest owner of farms in the country. This is a very bad thing. I mean it\'s already bad enough that the vast majority of all products at the grocery store are owned by only a handful  of companies. Imagine if only a handful grow all the food. Talk about power.1😬 Swab is preaching the great reset saying ""you\'ll own nothing but be happy "" All of their visions for our future are ones where all of us have to be OK with having significantly less while they get more. Musk on the other hand has a vision where things in the future are more decentralized so they give power to each individual rather than for him and his billionaire buddies Ike Gates and Schwab want.  Musk doesn\'t care about money or power. His motivation is one of impact. He wants to change the world in a significantly meaningful way. Sure you could  say that alone is selfish because he could be motivated by wanting ro be remembered and leaving  a legacy, but who doesn\'t want that?  All I want to know is where we\'re you guys when Twitter and FB were deliberately censoring or silencing people in order to manipulate people into voting for the candidates they back. This means that liberals were obviously the ones who were indoctrinated. That doesn\'t make you mad? Musk just released a ton of files show the blatant corruption and collision between liberal politicians and social media.  Coincidentally it was after he did this that they began attacking Musk hardcore. And all of you are now doing their bidding.  It\'s crazy. Why are all of you so obsessed with Musk...wait until he gets things dialed and reveals the real reason why he bought Twitter.....it\'s friggin genius and will benefit all of us greatly.  Yet you guys run around parroting concerns and hating on someone you don\'t even know and whose actions do no harm to you whatsoever. Hate all you want, it\'s what unsuccessful people do. Just understand that a wolf cares not of the opinions of sheep. Not referring to Musk rather the fact that this is tantamount to being a bunch of school hats gossips or cyber bullies  people really need to stop listening to others and start thinking for yourselves.']"

And that it is measurable so we normalize this....Because the models sure do... Otherwise they wouldn't function.

That being said it's interesting that he compares these changes that happened over an even longer time scale to the potential warming from our current spike in CO2 production.

Lastly they never presented a comprehensive model that has higher predictive power than the ones in circulation today. While they often are starting issues with modeling as a whole or older issues we have worked past they fail to then quantify and qualify their implications to the models at play already. Also the IPCC is a report not a model so it's not the strongest form of evidence."", 'Basically, humans are dipping into fossil fuel reserves locked up underground by natural geologic processes of the carbon cycle and releasing carbon dioxide into the air. Carbon dioxide is a gas that traps heat (which is a greenhouse gas), so the more of it there is in the atmosphere, the warmer it gets. We keep on adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, so we are continuing to cause warming. However, it isn’t as simple as adding carbon dioxide directly increases warming. The addition of carbon dioxide and subsequent warming causes instabilities in other parts of the earth system, for example the salt concentration of ocean water. The warming causes melting of ice caps, which lessen the saltiness of sea water and disrupt ocean currents. As I mentioned before, the disruption of the Gulf Stream by the melting of Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice cap could disrupt the flow of the Gulf Stream to Europe, thereby plunging Europe into freezing temperatures as it is in a high latitude and is only kept mild by the warm Gulf Stream current. This is just one example, and the gist of it is that the addition of co2 to the atmosphere will cause a chain reaction of climate effects that will be entirely unpredictable. The only thing we can predict is the increase in atmospheric co2 concentrations, which will inevitably destabilize the climate. And the natural climate cycles never happen this quickly. Sure, we have the odd volcanic eruption that results in cooling, or increased solar activity that results in a little bit of warming, but we have seen an unprecedented increase in warming over the last 100 years, which directly correlates to the addition of co2 to the atmosphere by humans. Natural cycles do not cause change on such short scales, the processes that change the temperature/climate of earth either release co2 into the atmosphere (weathering of rock), or affect earths orbit/position (milankovitch cycles) operate on 1,000s to 100,000s of years. Meanwhile, this change has been occurring over little more than a century and directly parallels human consumption of fossil fuels, and is rising exponentially instead of at a steady rate. By the way, I learned a lot of this in my environmental science class but also through research.']"

But I do know that people make decisions based on a multitude of factors and it’s overly presumptive of either of us to conclude that one factor weighed more heavily in the decision to have a child. One factor that I had never considered was cultural norms around weddings in the south. I had an African American coworker whose family came from the south. She and her partner both earned good middle class income and they had a daughter without getting married. One day she mentioned that they hadn’t gotten married because in her culture marriage must be a large formal event. They couldn’t just have a small, private ceremony or go to the courthouse, or elope to Vegas like I did. They would have to have a big todo in a church with every possible relative or friend they ever knew or met there. And even for a middle class couple, that meant saving up for a long time.

In all the cases you mentioned, you are mostly confusing race and ethnicity which are completely different.   And a patients ethnicity being part of a diagnostic work up is wildly different than it being the best lens to view a disease which is what was said and what I responded to.   “Joseph Graves Jr, Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona in Phoenix, goes even further, saying that physicians should not use skin colour to diagnose and treat individuals, but only family history. ‘What most people would describe as African American, 80% of that individual’s genes originate somewhere in Africa. But others with the same appearance might have inherited varying amounts of genes from American Indians, Europeans and Africans,’ Graves said. ‘African Americans do have unique health needs,’ he acknowledges, but he also felt that the complex interaction between socioeconomic and environmental conditions contributed more than genetics. For instance, 90% of Africans in Nigeria have the 235T mutation in the ACE gene locus—a marker for hypertension—but only 10% actually have hypertension. Compare that with 85% of African Americans with the mutation, and over 30% who have the disease,”  If you’re actually interested in the subject and not just arguing your point, I’d recommend the below article on the subject.

I am actually mesmerized by the African-American slavery experience, and the History of the USA. I just can\'t stop reading and researching it.   My great-grandaparents on my mother\'s side were African slaves brought to Cuba. My maternal-grandmother could speak YOURUBA. My mother could understand it, but not speak it. I can do neither. But, the differences between a black Cuban, and a black American are really startling. I was very taken aback when I realized Black Americans did not play African drums. Later I learned they actually can\'t. Neither do they believe in African deities. It stroke me as weird, until I researched the true reason. Their History has been erased.   Black Americans are the only blacks in the world who can\'t play African drums, and don\'t believe in SANTERIA. Every single African group in the world will do these two things. And also, not ONE black American I have spoken to knows which part of Africa they descend from. They just don\'t know. Their entire History has been erased. I\'ve even have met African-Americans who do not actually know where Africa is. And to me that is simply ABHORRENT. But, that\'s the way it is.   On my father\'s side my Black African great-grandmother married a white Spaniard. She was brought in to Cuba as a slave. But this Spaniard guy fell in love with her. And he purchased her freedom so they could be married. Tha Law did not allow for a free individual to marry a slave. They could either be both slaves, or both free. And they finally married. Neither of them was lynched. An scenario like that was absolutely impossible in America until 1957 with Loving vs. Virginia. And then I learnt about Emmitt Till. I couldn\'t believe it. American slavery of blacks was so unique in so many aspects. And much of the ostracism of blacks still remain in place.  America\'s RACISM is baked into the American society.

VAERS is the system that's used to discover statistical anomalies (termed signals) that can then be investigated to determine if there is a causal connection.  VAERS is not a system that can be used to determine causes of death. In fact, if you have read the reports on VAERS (anyone can) I have spotted reports that said the deaths were not related to the vaccine - e.g. lady fell and hit her head.

Most times it only really takes one competitor to foil the problems that arise with monopolies.', 'One of the biggest threats to a monopoly is threat of entry to the market. When a government over regulates a housing market, it makes it very difficult to enter the market and become profitable. Why do you think rent is so high in places that pride itself in regulating the market? San Francisco is a chief example. They have more regulation than you can swing a dead anything at, and the worst and most expensive housing you could imagine to show for it.  Developing and renting property is a bureaucratic nightmare, and therefore any sensible developer steers clear with their capital.  Sans government regulation, renting property is actually not that difficult of a market to enter if you have capital to put down.', 'Proven monopoly cases are rare and far between for a few reasons, the chief of which being that actual monopolies are rare and extremely difficult to form in the US. From what I have seen, most people complaining about monopolies do not actually know what they are talking about. Most people think that a monopoly can be summed up as simply ""big company!"". True monopolies that are actually problematic control their markets entirely. They are able to set both supply and price to whatever they want, have no threat from competition, and subsequently have no motivation to provide a quality product.  All it takes is one or two major competitors to foil this. Just because a market is consolidated, it doesn\'t mean that it isn\'t insanely competitive.

The FBI warned tech platforms that Russians would interfere in the election yet again, and they went over different ways they might possibly interfere. One way might be to hack and leak information.  It was up to individual platforms how to respond to election interference.  Tech companies mostly want to combat disinformation. People want to trust the information they get from social media platforms. Leave up too much misinformation and spam and people won’t find your site trustworthy.

They also have some options for automation that you really can't do without specific support for it, such as having the car pull out of a parking spot on its own, or cooling the cabin before you get back.  The reason you buy a luxury car is comfort, and the traditional mindset is that before adding a feature to a car it should be robust, reliable, and perfect. Tesla does not really play by those rules, so they provide tons of quality of life features through software updates, and I think it will be a while until competitors wise up to this and start presenting similar offerings. Until then, people who want Teslas and their features will likely be a capitive market, maybe a small and non-viable one eventually, but specs and reliability does not a good user experience make.

I think the issue you are expressing is that game developers who are finding the game they have to be unmarketable often turn to F2P as a cash grab. Instead of making more game they remove some of what they already have and use the rest as bait. The result is an unsatisfying, hollow experience which requires often exorbitant payment to complete.

The problem is that the ecological issues are not limited to CO2. The meat and animal products industry is responsible for a large share of methane (CH4) emissions, a GHG 25 times more potent than CO2 in terms of warming potential, and nitrous oxide, 100 times more powerful. This industry is also responsible for at least 60% of global deforestation, including more than 75% in the Amazon, which significantly increases CO2 emissions and affects carbon sinks. I could also talk about soil contamination, of which 30% of the degradation is attributable to the meat industry. Or the contamination of water tables and rivers or the massive use of land.     There are also epidemiological and public health arguments, as industry has been responsible for many of the epidemics and pandemics in human history. Besides, it uses 80% of the antibiotics in the world, leading to a resistance that today is becoming a serious scientific problem."", ""All of that is a great reason why one should look to reduce their meat and dairy intake. It still fails to be the best thing an individual can do though because even if I go vegan that cow is still getting raised those trees cut and those GHG emissions are still happening. However my choosing to take public transport is something I do that actually reduces co2. My replacement of all my gas appliances and removal of natural gas from my home reduces methane. My going solar also reduces methane, my area is powered by natural gas. Those things have actually prevented more GHG emissions. Veganism works only by collective action to shrink the meat industry. Individually is like carbon offseting interesting in theory but in reality it doesn't make measurable difference.  Edit: not to mention meat and dairy reduction is attainable for more people and meets them closer to where they are. You want the world to go vegan start winning hearts and minds.

A tax revolt = not paying taxes.           ""I am unable to think of any solution without using violence"" is not a win.

The threat of force is barely important for the functioning of all hierarchical societies. You make claims but you don’t defend them and, when you do, you fail.   This is word salad. Also not only do people not have to agree on everything, most of them *are not effected by that thing*.   Whatever you think I said doesn’t change the fact that it isn’t a strawman. It’s rich you think your fucking philosophy is the only kind of philosophy or that philosophy has any relevance to the question of “are you moving goalposts”.   Anarchy as “complete chaos” is actually workable and we can recontextualize “chaos” or “order” in all sorts of ways. Historical anarchists have done so, it isn’t as if “anarchy” didn’t mean “chaos” back then.   Not unless the general orders them to. And, by your logic, the people punching them should be in charge not the general because they’re not using violence at all.  See, there is literally no way you could argue that authority is derived from physical violence. It’s just not how things work.   Stop doing what? The general didn’t order them to punch people. He didn’t do anything at all.   This is nothing than a shoddy attempt at backpedaling. You’re arguing that authority is derived from violence but the authority in your situation hasn’t used violence at all.   If they’re using violence because the general ordered them to, the general hasn’t used violence. If they’re using violence because they love the general so much, *the general still didn’t use violence* (and also didn’t use their authority).  Either way, the general isn’t using violence nor, if the soldiers are going rogue, even commanding violence. Therefore the authority they have cannot be derived from violence.  This is another shitty argument that’s just as bad as the last one. You have a completely dogmatic attachment to the idea that authority = force. It’s fucking insane.   That’s circular logic. Their violence is only possible via equipment but they’re using violence to get that equipment? That doesn’t make sense.  In fact, the idea of a general strike relies on the fact that militaries need social support to exist. Without which they would be incapable of accomplishing anything. And equipment would be produced for the working class not rulers since they’re the ones who actually produce it.  Either way you’re wrong, they *buy* it or pay people to produce it. Literally every government does. That’s how thing actually work. Your ideas don’t resemble how reality actually works. That’s why it’s complete bullshit.   It isn’t. It’s achieved through literal houses of cards. Organizations are structured such that they depend on government for their existence. This leads to compliance with governmental authority and.in turn, obtains compliance elsewhere.   Those higher up in organizations and even those lower down don’t have any major incentive to disobey. For those higher up it’s the opposite. And the dominance of hierarchy everywhere along with its reliance upon government forces people to comply.   Yes they are words. Good job! Now read them.  Justification means “acting without consequence”. Any other meanings are non-material and therefore not necessary.   How old are you? You talk like it’s your first day speaking English.']"
